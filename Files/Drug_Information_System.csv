Effects of Chemotherapy,Akynzeo (netupitant and palonosetron),"General Information
Akynzeo is a fixed combination of netupitant, a substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist, and palonosetron, a serotonin-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist. Oral palonosetron prevents nausea and vomiting during the acute phase and netupitant prevents nausea and vomiting during both the acute and delayed phase after cancer chemotherapy.
Akynzeo is specifically indicated for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of cancer chemotherapy, including, but not limited to, highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
Akynzeo is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. Akynzeo should be administered approximately 1 hour prior to the start of chemotherapy, woth or without food.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Akynzeo was based on two trials.
Trial One
In a multicenter, randomized, parallel, double-blind, controlled clinical trial of 694 patients, the efficacy and safety of a single dose of oral netupitant in combination with oral palonosetron was compared with a single oral dose of palonosetron in cancer patients receiving a chemotherapy regimen that included cisplatin (median dose=75 mg/m2). The efficacy of Akynzeo was assessed in 135 patients who received Akynzeo (netupitant 300 mg and palonosetron 0.5 mg) and 136 patients who received oral palonosetron 0.5 mg. The efficacy endpoints were complete response (CR) (defined as no emetic episode and no use of rescue medication) for the 25-120 hour interval (delayed phase), CR for the 0-24 hour interval (acute phase), and CR within 120 hours (overall phase) after the start of the chemotherapy administration.
Complete Response- Delayed Phase: Akynzeo 90.4% and Palonosetron 80.1% (p-0.032)
Complete Response- Acute Phase: Akynzeo 98.5% and Palonosetron 89.7% (p- 0.002)
Complete Response- Overall Phase: Akynzeo 89.6% and Palonosetron 76.5% (p- 0.003)
Trial Two
In a multicenter, randomized, parallel, double-blind, active controlled, superiority trial, the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of Akynzeo was compared with a single oral dose of palonosetron 0.5 mg in cancer patients scheduled to receive the first cycle of an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) regimen for the treatment of a solid malignant tumor. All patients received a single oral dose of dexamethasone. After completion of cycle 1, patients had the option to participate in a multiple-cycle extension, receiving the same treatment as assigned in cycle 1. There was no pre-specified limit of the number of repeat consecutive cycles for any patient. A total of 1455 patients were randomized to the Akynzeo arm or palonosetron arm. A total of 1450 patients (Akynzeo n=725; palonosetron n=725) received study medication: of these, 1438 patients (98.8%) completed cycle 1 and 1286 patients (88.4%) continued treatment in the multiple-cycle extension. A total of 907 patients (62.3%) completed the multiple-cycle extension up to a maximum of eight treatment cycles. The primary efficacy endpoint was the CR rate in the delayed phase, 25-120 hours after the start of chemotherapy administration. Complete response in the Delayed Phase was achieved by 76.9% of the subjects in the Akynzeo arm and 69.5% in the Palonosetron arm (p - 0.001).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Akynzeo may include, but are not limited to, the following:
headache
asthenia
dyspepsia
fatigue
constipation
erythema
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Akynzeo or chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, please visit www.akynzeo.com","Mechanism of Action
Akynzeo is a fixed combination of netupitant and palonosetron. Netupitant is a selective antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. Delayed emesis has been largely associated with the activation of tachykinin family neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors (broadly distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems) by substance P. In in vitro and in vivo studies, netupitant inhibits substance P mediated responses. Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. Chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by stimulating the release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. Serotonin then activates 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. The development of acute emesis is known to depend on serotonin and its 5-HT3 receptors have been demonstrated to selectively stimulate the emetic response.
"
Effects of Chemotherapy,Prolia (denosumab),"General Information
Prolia (denosumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to and inhibits the receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANK Ligand), the primary mediator of bone resorption. RANK Ligand is the protein responsible for activating osteoclasts, the cells that break down bone. An increased amount of the protein has been linked as the primary cause of a broad range of bone loss conditions including osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, bone erosions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and bone metastases.
Prolia is specifically indicated for the following patients at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture:
â€¢ Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.
â€¢ To increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.
â€¢ Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women at high risk of fracture who are either initiating or continuing systemic glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5mg or greater of prednisone and expected to remain on glucocorticoids for at least 6months.
â€¢ To increase bone mass in men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer.
â€¢ To increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer.
Prolia is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous administration. The recommended initial dose is 60 mg administered as a single subcutaneous injection once every 6 months. Prolia should be administered via subcutaneous injection in the upper arm, the upper thigh, or the abdomen.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Prolia for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was based on a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial enrolled 7,808 women aged 60 to 91 years with a baseline BMD T-score between -2.5 and -4.0 at either the lumbar spine or total hip. Women with other diseases or on therapy that affect bone were excluded. The women were randomized to receive SC injections of either placebo or Prolia 60 mg once every 6 months. All women received at least 1000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of new morphometric (radiologically-diagnosed) vertebral fractures at 3 years. Prolia significantly reduced the incidence of new morphometric vertebral fractures at 1, 2, and 3 years. The incidence of new vertebral fractures at year 3 was 7.2% in the placebo-treated women compared to 2.3% for the Prolia-treated women.
The FDA approval of Prolia to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis was based on a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled men (n=242) had a baseline BMD T-score between -2.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck. Men with a BMD T-score between -1.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck were also enrolled if there was a history of prior fragility fracture. The subjects were randomized to receive SC injections of either placebo (n=121) or Prolia 60mg (n =121) once every 6 months. All men received at least 1000mg calcium and at least 800IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine Bone Mineral Density (BMD) from baseline to 1-year. The treatment differences in BMD at 1-year were 4.8% (+0.9% placebo, +5.7% Prolia; at the lumbar spine, 2.0% (+0.3% placebo, +2.4% Prolia) at the total hip, and 2.2% (0.0% placebo, +2.1% Prolia) at femoral neck.
The FDA approval of Prolia in the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was based on the 12-month primary analysis of a 2-year, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled study of 795 patients (70% women and 30% men) aged 20 to 94 years (mean age of 63 years) treated with greater than or equal to 7.5mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent) for < 3 months prior to study enrollment and planning to continue treatment for a total of at least 6 months (glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation; n = 290) or â‰¥ 3 months prior to study enrollment and planning to continue treatment for a total of at least 6 months (glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation, n = 505). Enrolled patients <50 years of age were required to have a history of osteoporotic fracture. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either an oral daily bisphosphonate (active-control, risedronate 5mg once daily) (n = 397) or Prolia 60mg subcutaneously once every 6 months (n = 398) for one year. Patients received at least 1000mg calcium and 800IU vitamin D supplementation daily. In the glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation, Prolia significantly increased lumbar spine BMD compared to the active-control at one year (Active-control 0.8%, Prolia 3.8%) with a treatment difference of 2.9%. In the glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation, Prolia significantly increased lumbar spine BMD compared to active-control at one year (Active-control 2.3%, Prolia 4.4%) with a treatment difference of 2.2%.
The FDA approval of Prolia in the treatment of bone loss in men with non-metastatic prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was based on a 3-year, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national study conducted in 1,468 men. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -0.4, and 22% of men had a vertebral fracture at baseline. Men were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (n=734) or Prolia 60mg (n=734) once every 6 months for a total of 6 doses. Randomization was stratified by age (<70 years vs. â‰¥70 years) and duration of ADT at trial entry (â‰¤6 months vs. >6 months). Seventy-nine percent of patients received ADT for more than 6months at study entry. All men received at least 1000mg calcium and 400IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to month 24. Lumbar spine BMD was higher at 2 years in Prolia-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients [-1.0% placebo, +5.6% Prolia; treatment difference 6.7%].
The FDA approval of Prolia for the treatment of bone loss in women receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy for breast cancer was based on a 2-year, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study. Women (n=252) had baseline BMD T-scores between -1.0 to-2.5 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck, and had not experienced fracture after age 25. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -1.1,and 2.0% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline. Women were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (n=125) or Prolia 60mg (n=127) once every 6 months for a total of 4 doses. Randomization was stratified by duration of adjuvant AI therapy at trial entry (â‰¤6months vs. >6months). Sixty-two percent of patients received adjuvant AI therapy for more than 6 months at study entry. All women received at least 1000mg calcium and 400IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to month 12. Lumbar spine BMD was higher at 12 months in Prolia-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients [-0.7% placebo, +4.8% Prolia; treatment difference 5.5%].

Prolia (denosumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to RANKL, a transmembrane or soluble protein essential for the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. Prolia prevents RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone.

Effects of Chemotherapy,Sustol (granisetron),"General Information
Sustol (granisetron) is a serotonin-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist.
Sustol is specifically indicated for use in combination with other antiemetics in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy regimens.
Sustol is supplied as an extended release injection for subcutaneous use. The recommended dose in adults is 10 mg administered as a single subcutaneous injection at least 30 minutes before the start of emetogenic chemotherapy on Day 1.
Do not administer Sustol more frequently than once every 7 days.
Use of Sustol with successive emetogenic chemotherapy cycles for more than 6 months is not recommended.
See full prescribing information for recommended dosage of concomitant dexamethasone.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Sustol was based on a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel group study. A single 10 mg subcutaneous dose of Sustol was compared to a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride in cancer patients administered moderately emetogenic (MEC) or anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy. Sustol or palonosetron hydrochloride was administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy on Day 1. Patients also received either 8 or 20 mg intravenous dexamethasone on Day 1 depending on chemotherapy regimen. Patients who received 20 mg of intravenous dexamethasone also received oral dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily on Days 2, 3, and 4. The primary endpoints were proportion of patients with complete response (CR) [defined as no emetic episodes (vomiting or retching) and no use of rescue medication] during the acute phase (0 to 24 hours) and the delayed phase (>24 to 120 hours) following the administration of chemotherapy in Cycle 1. The study design allowed for assessment of non-inferiority of Sustol to palonosetron hydrochloride in the acute and delayed phase of MEC and of AC combination chemotherapy. Non-inferiority of Sustol to palonosetron hydrochloride was demonstrated in the acute and delayed phases of MEC and of AC combination chemotherapy.

Sustol (granisetron) is a serotonin-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. During chemotherapy that induces vomiting, mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin, which stimulates 5-HT3 receptors. This evokes vagal afferent discharge, inducing vomiting. Animal studies demonstrate that, in binding to 5-HT3 receptors, granisetron blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin.

Effects of Chemotherapy,Syndros (dronabinol oral solution),"General Information
Syndros is an orally administered liquid formulation of the pharmaceutical cannabinoid dronabinol, a pharmaceutical version of tetrahydrocannabinol (""THC""). Dronabinol has complex effects on the CNS, including central sympathomimetic activity. Cannabinoid receptors have been discovered in neural tissues. These receptors may play a role in mediating the effects of dronabinol.
Syndros is specifically indicated for 1) anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS); and 2) nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments.
Syndros is supplied as a solution for oral administration. The recommended dose is as follows:
Anorexia Associated with Weight Loss in Adult Patients with AIDS:
Starting Dosage: The recommended adult starting dosage of Syndros is 2.1 mg orally twice daily, one hour before lunch and one hour before dinner. In elderly patients, consider initiating Syndros at 2.1 mg once daily one hour before dinner or at bedtime to reduce the risk of central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. Dosing later in the day may reduce the frequency of CNS adverse reactions.
Dosage Titration: If tolerated and further therapeutic effect is desired, the dosage may be increased gradually to 2.1 mg one hour before lunch and 4.2 mg one hour before dinner. Increase the dose of Syndros gradually in order to reduce the frequency of dose-related adverse reactions. Most patients respond to 2.1 mg twice daily, but the dose may be further increased to 4.2 mg one hour before lunch and 4.2 mg one hour before dinner, as tolerated to achieve a therapeutic effect. The maximum dosage is 8.4 mg twice daily.
Nausea and Vomiting Associated with Cancer Chemotherapy in Adult Patients Who Failed Conventional Antiemetics:
Starting Dosage: The recommended starting dosage of Syndros is 4.2 mg/m2 orally administered 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy and then every 2 to 4 hours after chemotherapy for a total of 4 to 6 doses per day. In elderly patients, consider initiating Syndros at 2.1 mg/m2 once daily 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy to reduce the risk of CNS symptoms. Because food delays the absorption of Syndros, administer the first dose on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before eating. Subsequent doses can be taken without regard to meals. Because food can substantially change the systemic exposure to dronabinol and its active metabolite, the timing of dosing in relation to meal times should be kept consistent for each chemotherapy cycle, once the dosage has been determined from the titration process.
Dosage Titration: The dosage can be titrated to clinical response during a chemotherapy cycle or subsequent cycles, based upon initial effect, as tolerated to achieve a clinical effect, in increments of 2.1 mg/m2 . The maximum dosage is 12.6 mg/m2 per dose for 4 to 6 doses per day. Monitor patients for adverse reactions and consider decreasing the dose to 2.1 mg once daily 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy to reduce the risk of CNS adverse reaction.
Clinical Results

Effects of Chemotherapy,Zuplenz (ondansetron oral soluble film),"General Information
Zuplenz is an oral soluble film formulation of the FDA approved drug ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Zuplenz uses proprietary PharmFilm oral soluble film technology from MonoSol Rx to rapidly dissolve on the tongue without the need for water, which can cause additional discomfort for patients suffering from nausea and vomiting.
Zuplenz is specifically indicated for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with the following: highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy in patients receiving total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen and post-operation.
The recommended dosing of Zuplenz oral soluble film is as follows:
Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy:
The adult oral dosage is 24 mg given successively as three 8 mg films 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy.
Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy:
Adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older: One 8 mg film 30 minutes before chemotherapy followed by an 8 mg dose 8 hours later. Administer one 8 mg film twice a day (every 12 hours) for 1 to 2 days after completion of chemotherapy.
Pediatric patients 4 through 11 years of age: One 4 mg film three times a day. Administer the first dose 30 minutes before chemotherapy, with subsequent doses 4 and 8 hours later. Administer one 4 mg film three times a day (every 8 hours) for 1 to 2 days after completion of chemotherapy.
Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy:
The adult dosage is one 8 mg film three times a day.
Postoperative nausea and vomiting:
The adult dose is 16 mg given successively as two 8 mg films 1 hour before anesthesia.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Zuplenz oral film was based on the following studies evaluating odansetron tablets, as well as a bioequivalence study.
Bioequivalence Study
A clinical study compared the bioequivalence of Zuplenz 8 mg to Zofran ODT (orally dissolving tablet) 8 mg. The pharmacokinetic results of these studies demonstrated that a single dose of Zuplenz, taken with or without water and under fed and fasting conditions, was comparable to Zofran ODT.
Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting
Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy
Two randomized, double-blind, monotherapy trials evaluated a single 24 mg ondansetron HCl tablet. The first trial enrolled 357 adult cancer patients receiving chemotherapy regimens containing cisplatin >50 mg/m2. The subjects received oral doses of ondansetron 24 mg once a day, 8 mg twice a day, and 32 mg once a day. A total of 66% of patients in the ondansetron 24 mg once-a-day group, 55% in the ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group, and 55% in the ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group completed the 24hour study period with no emetic episodes and no rescue antiemetic medications, the primary endpoint of efficacy. Each of the three treatment groups was shown to be statistically significantly superior to a historical placebo control. The second trial was similar in design and confirmed the results.
Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy
In one double-blind US study, 67 patients received ondansetron HCl tablets 8 mg administered twice a day were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing vomiting induced by cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy containing doxorubicin. Treatment response is based on the total number of emetic episodes over the 3-day study period. Zero emetic episodes were reported by 61% of the odansetron arm versus 6% of the placebo arm. In a second double-blind US study in 336 patients, ondansetron HCl tablets 8 mg administered twice a day were as effective as ondansetron HCl tablets 8 mg administered 3 times a day in preventing nausea and vomiting induced by cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy containing either methotrexate or doxorubicin.
Pediatrics
Three open-label, uncontrolled, foreign trials enrolled 182 pediatric patients 4 to 18 years old with cancer who were given a variety of cisplatin or non-cisplatin regimens. In these trials, the initial dose of ondansetron HCl injection ranged from 0.04 mg/kg to 0.87 mg/kg for a total dose of 2.16 mg to 12 mg. This was followed by the administration of ondansetron HCl tablets ranging from 4 mg to 24 mg daily for 3 days. In these studies, 58% of the 170 evaluable patients had a complete response (no emetic episodes) on day 1. Two studies showed the response rates for patients less than 12 years of age who received ondansetron HCl tablets 4 mg three times daily to be similar to those in patients 12 to 18 years of age who received ondansetron HCl tablets 8 mg three times daily.
Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting
Total Body Irradiation
In a randomized, double-blind study in 20 patients, ondansetron HCl tablets (8 mg given 1.5 hours before each fraction of radiotherapy for 4 days) were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing vomiting induced by total body irradiation.
Single High-Dose Fraction Radiotherapy
In a double-blind trial in 105 patients receiving single high-dose radiotherapy (800 to 1,000 cGy) over an anterior or posterior field size of >80 cm2 to the abdomen, ondansetron was significantly more effective than metoclopramide with respect to complete control of emesis (0 emetic episodes). Patients received the first dose of ondansetron HCl tablets (8 mg) or metoclopramide (10 mg) 1 to 2 hours before radiotherapy. If radiotherapy was given in the morning, 2 additional doses of study treatment were given (1 tablet late afternoon and 1 tablet before bedtime). If radiotherapy was given in the afternoon, patients took only 1 further tablet that day before bedtime. Patients continued the oral medication on a three times daily basis for 3 days.
Daily Fractionated Radiotherapy
A double-blind trial enrolled 135 patients receiving a 1- to 4-week course of fractionated radiotherapy (180 cGy doses) over a field size of >100 cm2 to the abdomen. The subjects received the first dose of ondansetron HCl tablets (8 mg) or prochlorperazine (10 mg) 1 to 2 hours before the first daily radiotherapy fraction, with 2 subsequent doses on a three times a day basis. Patients continued the oral medication on a three times daily basis on each day of radiotherapy. Ondansetron was significantly more effective than prochlorperazine with respect to complete control of emesis (0 emetic episodes).
Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting
Two double-blind studies (1 US study, 1 foreign) enrolled 865 women who received ondansetron 1 hour before the induction of general balanced anesthesia. Ondansetron HCl tablets (16 mg) were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting.
","Side Effects

Elevated Triglycerides (Hypertriglyceridemia),Epanova (omega-3-carboxylic acids),"General Information
Epanova (omega-3-carboxylic acids) is a lipid-regulating agent containing fish oil-derived free fatty acids, designated omega-3-carboxylic acids, with at least 850 mg of polyunsaturated fatty acids, including multiple omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA].
Epanova is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe (>500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia.
Epanova is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended dose is 2 grams (2 capsules) or 4 grams (4 capsules) once daily. The dosage should be individualized according to the patientâ€™s response and tolerability.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Epanova was based on a 12-week randomized, placebo (olive oil)-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial. After a wash-out period of lipid-altering medications other than statins and ezetimibe, patients whose TG levels were between 500 and 2,000 mg/dL were randomly assigned to placebo or Epanova 2, 3, or 4 grams per day. Overall, the median baseline triglyceride level was 694 mg/dL. Median baseline non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels were 217 mg/dL, 81 mg/dL, and 28 mg/dL, respectively. Treatment with Epanova led to statistically significant reductions in fasting TG levels and statistically significant reductions in non-HDL-C levels compared with placebo, but increased LDL-C levels.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Epanova may include, but are not limited to, the following:
diarrhea
nausea
abdominal pain or discomfort
eructation

The mechanism of action of Epanova is not completely understood. Potential mechanisms of action include inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase, increased mitochondrial and peroxisomal ÃŸ-oxidation in the liver, decreased lipogenesis in the liver, and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. Epanova may reduce the synthesis of triglycerides in the liver because EPA and DHA are poor substrates for the enzymes responsible for TG synthesis, and EPA and DHA inhibit esterification of other fatty acids.

Endocrinology,Accretropin (somatropin rDNA Original),"General Information
Accretropin is a sustained release formulation of recombinant human growth hormone product. This protein is produced by recombinant DNA technology during fermentation in E. coli, yielding a protein containing 192 amino acids. The N-terminal amino acid, methionine, is later removed to yield a protein that is chemically and physicochemically identical to pituitary derived human growth hormone, consisting of 191 amino acids in a single polypeptide chain.
Accretropin is specifically indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to an inadequate secretion of normal endogenous growth hormone and for the treatment of short stature associated with Turner Syndrome in pediatric patients whose epiphyses are not closed.
Accretropin is supplied as a solution designed for subcutaneous administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is as follows:
Growth Hormone Deficiency
The recommended weekly dose is 0.18 mg/kg body weight to 0.3 mg/kg (0.90 IU/kg) body weight. The dose should be divided into equal daily doses given 6 or 7 times per week subcutaneously.
Turner Syndrome
The recommended weekly dose is 0.36 mg/kg of body weight. The dose should be divided into equal daily doses given 6 or 7 times per week subcutaneously.
Failure of Accretropin to increase growth rate, particularly during the first year of therapy, should prompt assessment of compliance and evaluation of other causes of growth failure such as hypothyroidism, under-nutrition and advanced bone age.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Accretropin was based on the results of two clinical trials.
Growth Hormone Deficiency
This single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial enrolled 44 pediatric subjects who were treated for up to 3 years with an Accretropin dose of 0.03 to 0.05 mg/kg/day (0.18 to 0.30 mg/kg/week) subcutaneously.

Endocrinology,Activella (Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate) Tablets,"General Information
Activella has been approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with an intact uterus for prevention of osteoporosis. It is also indicated for several other symptoms associated with menopause, such as severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Activella is a combination hormone replacement therapy (HRT) tablet containing both estrogen and progestin. The tablet is administered once daily with a dosage of 1 mg of the estrogen (17beta-estradiol) and 0.5 mg of the progestin (norethindrone acetate).
Activella has already been approved in Europe for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis and has been marketed there under the name Activelle or Kliovance. Pharmacia & Upjohn, under terms of an agreement with Novo Nordisk, will be marketing the new HRT in the U.S.
Clinical Results
The effects of Activella on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) was investigated in the U.S. and in Europe in two multi-center, placebo-controlled studies. Participants were all postmenopausal women with intact uteri and baseline BMD values for lumbar spine within two standard deviations of the mean in healthy young women. Patients were randomized to groups given different dosages of either estradiol alone, norethindrone alone, a combination of the two (Activella), or placebo. Treatment was supplemented with calcium (500-1000 mg/day). In the United States and European studies, the mean percentage change in BMD between Activella and placebo was 5.9% and 6.3%, respectively.
Also, Activella yielded a statistically significant reduction in serum and urine markers of bone turnover. This effect was apparent after three months of treatment and was retained for the entire two-year treatment period.
","Side Effects
Common side effects include:
Breast tenderness/pain
Upper respiratory tract infections
Headache
Postmenopausal bleeding
Women who have been diagnosed with the following, should NOT take Activella:
Known or suspected pregnancy
Breast cancer
Estrogen- dependent neoplasia
Active deep vein thrombosis
Thromboembolic disorders or stroke
Undiagnosed genital bleeding
Liver dysfunction or disease
Hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients in the drug
Women who have had hysterectomies should NOT take Activella, as the existing data suggests that the combination therapy of estrogen and progestin may increase risk of glucose intolerance and less favorable effects on lipid metabolism in women without a uterus.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism, and estrogen replacement therapy acts to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.
Progestin compounds enhance cellular differentiation and generally oppose the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels, increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites, or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen. Progestins exert their effects in target cells by binding to specific progesterone receptors that interact with progesterone response elements in target genes. Progesterone receptors have been identified in the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, and central nervous system. Progestins produce similar endometrial changes to those of the naturally occurring hormone progesterone.

Endocrinology,ACTOplus met (pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride),"General Information
ACTOplus met is a single dose combination of two approved drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes: Actos (pioglitazone) and metformin. Actos reduces insulin resistance and metformin lowers the amount of blood sugar made by the liver.
ACTOplus met is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are already treated with a thiazolidinedione and metformin or who have inadequate glycemic control on a thiazolidinedione alone or metformin alone.
ACTOplus met is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is as follows:
Starting dose for patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy
Based on the usual starting dose of pioglitazone (15-30 mg daily), ACTOplus met may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once or twice daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.
Starting dose for patients who initially responded to pioglitazone monotherapy and require additional glycemic control
Based on the usual starting doses of metformin (500 mg twice daily or 850 mg daily), ACTOplus met may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.
Starting dose for patients switching from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus metformin as separate tablets
ACTOplus met may be initiated with either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strengths based on the dose of pioglitazone and metformin already being taken.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
At the time of FDA approval, no efficacy studies had been conducted with ActoPlus Met single tablets. However, efficacy and safety of the separate components had been previously established. In addition, the the co-administration of the separate components was evaluated for efficacy and safety in two clinical studies, demonstrating the bioequivalence with Actoplus Met.
Study One
This randomized, controlled study enrolled 328 subjects receiving metformin, either alone or in combination with another antihyperglycemic agent, who had inadequate glycemic control. The subjects received either 30 mg of pioglitazone or placebo once daily for 16 weeks in addition to their established metformin regimen. The addition of pioglitazone 30 mg once daily to metformin treatment significantly reduced the mean A1C by 0.83% and the mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) by 37.7 mg/dL at Week 16 from that observed with metformin alone.
Study Two
This randomized, controlled study enrolled 827 subjects receiving metformin, either alone or in combination with another antihyperglycemic agent, who had inadequate glycemic control. The subjects received either 30 mg or 45 mg of pioglitazone once daily for 24 weeks in addition to their established metformin regimen. The mean reductions from Baseline at Week 24 in A1C were 0.80% and 1.01% for the 30 mg and 45 mg doses, respectively. Mean reductions from Baseline in FPG were 38.2 mg/dL and 50.7 mg/dL, respectively.Based on these reductions in A1C and FPG, the addition of pioglitazone to metformin resulted in significant improvements in glycemic control irrespective of the metformin dose.

Endocrinology,ACTOS,"General Information
ACTOS has been approved for the treatment of type II diabetes. ACTOS is the newest addition to the class of insulin sensitizing diabetes agents known as thiazolidinediones (TZDs), and is always dosed once daily without regard to meals. As an adjunct to diet and exercise, ACTOS has four therapy indications: monotherapy and in combination with sulfonylureas, metformin or insulin to improve glycemic control in patients with type II diabetes.
Clinical Results
The FDA approval was based on a review of data from 6 U.S. studies involving more than 4,500 patients with type II diabetes. In each trial, there was a statistically significant reduction in blood glucose levels.
","Side Effects
The majority of side effects reported during clinical trials were mild. The most commonly reported included symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, headache, sinusitis, muscle pain, tooth disorder, and sore throat.
","Additional Information
Patients with type II diabetes often have high triglyceride levels and low levels of HDL or ""good"" cholesterol. These 2 abnormalities increase the risk for heart disease, especially in patients with diabetes. Importantly compared with placebo, ACTOS significantly decreased mean triglyceride levels and increased mean HDL levels in both monotherapy and in combination with sulfonylureas, metformin, or insulin. In contrast, no significant change in mean total cholesterol or mean LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol levels was seen with ACTOS used either as monotherapy or in combination therapy.",
Endocrinology,Addyi (flibanserin),"General Information
Addyi (flibanserin) is a serotonin 1A receptor agonist and a serotonin 2A receptor antagonist.
Addyi is specifically indicated for the treatment of premenopausal women with acquired, generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) as characterized by low sexual desire that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.
Addyi is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dosage is 100 mg taken once daily at bedtime. Addyi should be dosed at bedtime because administration during waking hours increases risks of hypotension, syncope, accidental injury, and central nervous system (CNS) depression. Discontinue treatment after 8 weeks if no improvement is observed.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Addyi was based on three 24- week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3). The three trials included premenopausal women with acquired, generalized HSDD of at least 6 months duration. In the clinical trials, acquired HSDD was defined as HSDD that developed in subjects who previously had no problems with sexual desire. Generalized HSDD was defined as HSDD that was not limited to certain types of stimulation, situations or partners. The subjects were treated with Addyi 100 mg once daily at bedtime (n = 1187) or placebo (n = 1188). These trials each had two co-primary efficacy endpoints, one for satisfying sexual events (SSEs) and the other for sexual desire:
The change from baseline to Week 24 in the number of monthly SSEs (i.e., sexual intercourse, oral sex, masturbation, or genital stimulation by the partner). The SSEs were based on patient responses to the following questions: â€œDid you have a sexual event?â€� and â€œWas the sex satisfying for you?â€�
Studies 1 and 2 had a different sexual desire endpoint than Study 3:
In Studies 1 and 2, the sexual desire co-primary endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 24 in the calculated monthly sexual desire score and was based on patient responses to the question: â€œIndicate your most intense level of sexual desire.â€� Every day, patients rated their sexual desire level from 0 (no desire) to 3 (strong desire) and recorded their response in an electronic Diary (eDiary). These responses were summed over a 28-day period to yield the calculated monthly sexual desire score, which ranged from 0 to 84.
In Study 3, the desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI Desire) was the sexual desire co-primary endpoint. The desire domain of the FSFI has two questions. The first question asks patients â€œOver the past 4 weeks, how often did you feel sexual desire or interest?â€�, with responses ranging from 1 (almost never or never) to 5 (almost always or always). The second question asks patients â€œOver the past 4 weeks, how would you rate your level (degree) of sexual desire or interest?â€�, with responses ranging from 1 (very low or none at all) to 5 (very high). The FSFI Desire score was calculated by adding the patientâ€™s responses to these two questions then multiplying that sum by 0.6. The FSFI Desire domain score ranged from 1.2 to 6.
In all three trials, Addyi resulted in statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in the change from baseline in monthly SSEs at Week 24. In Study 1 and 2, there were no statistically significant differences between Addyi and placebo for the eDiary sexual desire endpoint (change in baseline to Week 24). In contrast, in Study 3 there was statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline to Week 24 in sexual desire (using the FSFI Desire Domain) with Addyi compared to placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Addyi may include, but are not limited to, the following:
dizziness
somnolence
nausea
fatigue
insomnia
dry mouth
Addyi comes with a boxed warning label:
The use of Addyi and alcohol increases the risk of severe hypotension and syncope; therefore, alcohol use is contraindicated.
Addyi is available only through a restricted program called the Addyi REMS Program.
Severe hypotension and syncope can occur when Addyi is used with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or in patients with hepatic impairment; therefore, Addyi use in these settings is contraindicated.

Endocrinology,Adlyxin (lixisenatide),"General Information
Adlyxin (lixisenatide) is a once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). GLP-1 is a peptide hormone that is released within minutes after eating a meal. It is known to suppress glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells and stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. Adlyxin increases glucose-dependent insulin release, decreased glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying.
Adlyxin is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise for the treatment of adults with type II diabetes.
Adlyxin is supplied in a disposable pre-filled pen in a single dose of 20 micrograms for subcutaneous administration. Patients will also receive a disposable pre-filled pen in a single dose of 10 micrograms that they should initiate once daily for 14 days. On Day 15, patients should increase dosage to 20 micrograms once daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Adlyxin was based on the GetGoal clinical program, which included 13 clinical trials involving more than 5,000 adults with type II diabetes worldwide. All studies of the GetGoal program successfully met the primary efficacy endpoint of HbA1c reduction. The GetGoal programme established the efficacy and safety profile of lixisenatide 20 Âµg once daily across the spectrum of patients with type 2 diabetes, including patients not treated with anti-diabetic agents, those failing on oral agents and as an adjunct to basal insulin therapy. The main efficacy endpoints were met in all studies, with the baseline to endpoint reductions in HbA1c consistently ranging from 0.7% to 1.0%. In a head-to-head comparison with exenatide 10 Î¼g twice daily, lixisenatide 20 Î¼g once daily was non-inferior for HbA1c reduction, achieved with threefold fewer patients with symptomatic hypoglycemia events and better gastrointestinal tolerability. Three randomised trials of lixisenatide treatment added to basal insulin showed significantly improved glycemic control over placebo, with pronounced postprandial glucose reductions and good tolerability.

Endocrinology,Afinitor (everolimus),"General Information
Afinitor (everolimus) is an antineoplastic agent that works by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a protein kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, motility and survival. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers. Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies.
Afinitor is specifically approved for the treatment of progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease.
Afinitor is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose of Afinitor for pancreatic cancer is is 10 mg once daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Afinitor for pancreatic cancer was based on a randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial in 410 subjects with locally advanced or metastatic advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and disease progression within the prior 12 months. The subjects received either Afinitor 10 mg/day or placebo until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS (median 11.0 months versus 4.6 months), resulting in a 65% risk reduction in investigator-determined PFS.

Endocrinology,Afrezza (insulin human) Inhalation Powder,"General Information
Afrezza is a rapid acting inhaled insulin powder. When the insulin is inhaled through the device, the powder is aerosolized and delivered to the lung.
Afrezza is specifically indicated to improve glycemic control in adult patients with diabetes mellitus.
Limitations of Use: Afrezza is not a substitute for long-acting insulin. Afrezza must be used in combination with long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Afrezza is not recommended for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Afrezza is supplied as a powder to be administered via oral inhalation. Afrezza should be administered at each mealtime. For specific dose requirements and dose adjustments, refer to the Afrezza drug label.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Afrezza was based on the following trial results:
Type I diabetes:
A 24-week, open-label, active-controlled study enrolled 344 subjects inadequately controlled type 1 diabetes to evaluate the glucose lowering effect of mealtime Afrezza used in combination with a basal insulin. Following a 4-week basal insulin optimization period, subjects were randomized to Afrezza (n=174) or insulin aspart (n=170)administered at each meal of the day. Mealtime insulin doses were titrated to glycemic goals for the first 12 weeks and kept stable for the last 12 weeks of the study. At Week 24, treatment with basal insulin and mealtime Afrezza provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the pre-specified requirement for non-inferiority margin of 0.4%. Afrezza provided less HbA1c reduction than insulin aspart, and the difference was statistically significant. More subjects in the insulin aspart group achieved the HbA1c target of â‰¤7%.
Type II diabetes:
A total of 479 adult patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on optimal/maximally tolerated doses of metformin only, or 2 or more oral antidiabetic (OAD) agents participated in a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Following a 6-week run-in period, 353 patients were randomized to Afrezza (n=177) or an inhaled placebo powder without insulin (n=176). Insulin doses were titrated for the first 12 weeks and kept stable for the last 12 weeks of the study. OADs doses were kept stable. At Week 24, treatment with Afrezza plus OADs provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that was statistically significantly greater compared to the HbA1c reduction observed in the placebo group.

Endocrinology,Aggrenox,"General Information
Stroke occurs when blood clots block blood flow to the brain. Aggrenox acts as an antiplatelet, preventing blood platelets from aggregating to form the dangerous clots.
Platelet aggregation is actually a natural process which allows platelet cells to stick together and adhere to the blood vessel wall to prevent excessive blood loss when a blood vessel is damaged. However, for patients who have high-risk of blood clotting, this mechanism can be dangerous. Aggrenox works to prevent the clotting in patients, such as stroke victims, who fall into this high-risk category.
Stroke, the third leading cause of death in the United States, afflicts 730,000 Americans in all and kills approximately 160,000 of those victims each year. Recurrance rate over five years ranges from 30% to nearly 50%, so a drug like Aggrenox which lowers the risk for recurrance is essential.
Clinical Results
Results of the European Stroke Prevention Study 2 (ESPS2), which involved over 6,600 patients, indicated that Aggrenox reduces the risk of recurrent stroke by 37% compared to placebo. Aspirin-only regimens reduced the risk by only 18% as compared to the placebo.
In addition, the results of the study indicated that Aggrenox may reduce risk for secondary stroke more effectively than Clopidogrel, another antiplatelet, although direct- comparison studies between the two drugs have not yet been done.
","Side Effects
Although Aggrenox generally well-tolerated, it was shown to induce headache, bleeding, and gastrointestinal events in some patients undergoing the treatment.
","Additional Information

Sudden numbness of face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body
Sudden confusion; trouble speaking or understanding
Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes

Endocrinology,Aldurazyme (laronidase),"General Information
Aldurazyme (laronidase) is a recombinant alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS-I).
Aldurazyme is indicated for patients aged 5 to 65 with Hurler and Hurler-Scheie forms of Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) and for patients with the Scheie form who have moderate to severe symptoms.
Aldurazyme is supplied as a sterile solution in clear Type I glass 5 mL vials (2.9 mg laronidase per 5 mL). The recommended dosage regimen of Aldurazyme is 0.58 mg/kg of body weight administered once weekly as an intravenous infusion.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Aldurazyme was based on a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 45 MPS I subjects. One subject was clinically assessed as having the Hurler form, 37 the Hurler-Scheie form and 7 the Scheie form. All subjects had a baseline forced vital capacity (FVC) less than or equal to 77% of predicted. Subjects received Aldurazyme (0.58 mg/kg) or placebo once weekly for 26 weeks and were treated with antipyretics and antihistamines before each infusion. The primary efficacy outcome assessments were FVC and distance walked in 6 minutes (6-minute walk test, 6MWT).
Results showed that after 26 weeks, subjects treated with Aldurazyme showed improvement in FVC and in 6MWT compared to placebo-treated subjects. Data demonstrated that liver size and urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels decreased in subjects treated with Aldurazyme compared with subjects treated with placebo. No subject in the group receiving Aldurazyme reached the normal range for urinary GAG levels during this 6-month study.
All 45 patients received open-label Aldurazyme for 36 weeks following the double-blind period. Maintenance of mean FVC and an additional increase in mean 6MWT distance were observed compared to the start of the open-label period among subjects who were initially randomized to and then continued to receive Aldurazyme. Among subjects who had been initially randomized to placebo, improvements from baseline in mean FVC and 6MWT distance were observed compared to the start of the open-label.
Approximately 91% of subjects treated with Aldurazyme were positive for antibodies to laronidase. The clinical significance of antibodies to Aldurazyme is not known, including the potential for product neutralization.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Fabrazyme may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Upper respiratory tract infection
Injection site reaction
Rash
Vein disorder
Hyperreflexia
Paresthesia
Edema
","Additional Information
For additional information on Mucopolysaccharidosis I or Aldurazyme, please visit The Aldurazyme Web Site","Mechanism of Action
Aldurazyme (laronidase), an enzyme replacement therapy is a polymorphic variant of the human enzyme, ?-L-iduronidase that is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. By replacing the missing enzyme, Aldurazyme helps the body break down the glycosaminoglycans (GAG) that builds up in cells and tissues. Regular replacement of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase with Aldurazyme helps prevent the buildup of GAG.
Aldurazyme was shown to significantly reduce the levels of GAG excreted in the urine, and decrease the size of livers enlarged by the disorder. This showed that the drug works effectively at a biochemical level.

Endocrinology,Amaryl (Glimepiride),"General Information
Amaryl is an insulin-sparing sulfonylurea agent for the treatment of type II diabetes. It is indicated as a first-line therapy to lower blood glucose in people with type II diabetes whose high blood glucose cannot be controlled by diet and exercise alone.
Clinical Results
Clinical research supports the recommendation that Amaryl be used as a monotherapy or in combination with insulin, a unique distinction among members of the sulfonylurea class of diabetes drugs. Amaryl provided highly effective glucose control with a once daily dosing schedule, which helped many type II diabetes subjects achieve 24-hour glucose control, without putting subjects at undue risk for low blood sugar, a complication of overly rigorous control. Highly effective glucose control was observed in a range of subjects including obesity and hypertension--and in traditional at risk populations such as Hispanics and African Americans.
",,"Additional Information
The incidence of diabetes in the United States is on the rise. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases estimates that 16 million Americans have diabetes mellitus, which represents an increase of five million compared with incidence of the disease 10 years ago. Yet, only half of the people believed to have diabetes have been diagnosed. Diabetes is the fourth-leading cause of death by disease in United States.
Type II diabetes, the more prevalent form of the disease, is often referred to as late-onset or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Of the eight million people diagnosed with diabetes, nearly 7.5 million have type II diabetes, and most of them require oral medication alone or in combination with insulin to keep blood sugar levels under control.
Studies on type I (insulin-dependent) diabetics in the landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial indicate that tight control reduced some of the devastating complications of the disease, such as retinopathy, kidney damage, and damage to the nerves that can lead to amputations. According to the American Diabetes Association, it is reasonable to recommend tighter glucose control for the millions of NIDDM subjects because it is presumed that the mechanisms by which glucose causes complications are the same in both forms of diabetes.",
Endocrinology,Androderm (Testosterone Transdermal System),"General Information
Androderm, a skin patch that can be placed on different parts of the body, boosts testosterone levels. It has been approved by the FDA as a treatment for hypogonadism, a condition in which the body produces inadequate levels of testosterone. Androderm helps to relieve symptoms of both primary hypogonadism (disorders of the testes) and secondary hypogonadism (disorders of the pituitary gland or hypothalmus area of the brain).
Clinical Results
In clinical trials, Androderm restored normal testosterone levels in 86 of 94 subjects who completed the trials.
","Side Effects
The most common side effects reported were temporary mild-to-moderate redness or itching at patch sites.
","Additional Information
A previously approved patch, Androderm can be placed on different parts of the body. Transdermal patches offer alternatives to testosterone injections, a therapy administered every two to four weeks that can create abnormal highs and lows in hormone levels.
Only about 5% of the estimated 4 million to 5 million American men with hypogonadism currently receive testosterone replacement therapy. Symptoms of the disorder include sexual dysfunction (loss of libido or impotence), fatigue, depressed mood, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, or absence or regression of secondary male sexual characteristics (muscle development, deep voice, or hair distribution).",
Endocrinology,AndroGel testosterone gel,"General Information
AndroGel is a hydroalcoholic gel to be applied to the clean, dry skin of the shoulders, upper arms and/or abdomen. The gel is absorbed through the skin and delivers testosterone to the patient for approximately 24 hours. This product is indicated for men with primary hypogonadism or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism which results from insufficient secretion of testosterone and is characterized by low serum testosterone concentrations.
Two types of hypogonadism for which this drug is indicated:
1. Primary hypogonadism: testicular failure; characterized by low serum testosterone levels and gonadotropins (FSH, LH) above the normal range
2. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism: idiopathic gonadotropin or LHRH deficiency or pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma, or radiation; characterized by low serum testosterone levels, but with gonadotropins in the normal or low range
In addition to supplying sufficient amounts of testosterone, AndroGel, like other drugs in its class, may promote retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and decreased urinary excretion of calcium. Furthermore, it may increase protein anabolism and decrease protein catabolism. This class of drugs (androgens) may also stimulate the production of red blood cells.
Hypogonadism affects approximately 4 to 5 million American men.
Symptoms of hypogonadism include:
Impotence
Decreased sexual desire
Fatigue and loss of energy
Mood depression
Regression of secondary sexual characteristics (growth and maturation of prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, including facial, pubic, chest, axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement; vocal chord thickening; alterations in body musculature; fat distribution)
Osteoporosis
Clinical Results
227 hypogonadal men participated in a research study investigating AndroGel 1%. The study was conducted in 2 phases: an Initial Treatment Period of the first 90 days and an Extended Treatment Period of the second 90 days. During both treatment stages, patients were randomized into different AndroGel dose groups and one non-scrotal testosterone transdermal system group. The first phase investigated 5 G daily and 10 daily of AndroGel and 5 mg daily of non-scrotal testosterone transdermal system. In the extended treatment phase, groups of patients continued with either 5 G daily or 10 G daily of AndroGel or 5 mg daily of non-scrotal testosterone transdermal system, and an additional treatment group taking 7.5 G AndroGel daily was added.
Results of the study showed that serum testosterone concentrations increased to the normal range within first day of treatment with doses of 5 G and 10 G. In patients continuing on AndroGel 5 G and 10 G, these mean testosterone levels were maintained within the normal range for the 180-day duration of the study. 87% of patients whose data could be analyzed achieved normal serum testosterone level on treatment day 180.
5 G, 7.5 G and 10 G doses of AndroGel all also significantly increased total body mass and total body lean mass and decreased total body fat mass and percent body fat. Furthermore, with 10 G AndroGel bone mineral density in the hip and spine increased significantly.
As a result of all doses of AndroGel, patients showed significant increases in libido and degree of penile erection and significant positive effects on mood and fatigue.
Another research study was conducted in order to investigate whether AndroGel could be transferred through skin-to-skin contact. AndroGel patients and their female partners engaged in daily vigorous skin-to-skin sessions. When evaluated, all unprotected females showed testosterone levels >2 times the baseline value at some point during the study. Wearing clothing, on the other hand, during skin-to-skin contact, prevented any transfer of the drug.

AndroGel is a hydroalcoholic formulation that dries quickly when applied to the skin surface. The skin serves as a reservoir for the sustained release of testosterone into the systemic circulationâ€¦
Circulating testosterone is chiefly bound in the serum to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. The albumin-bound fraction of testosterone easily dissociates from albumin and is presumed to be bioactive. The portion of testosterone bound to SHBG is not considered biologically active. The amount of SHBG in the serum and the total testosterone level will determine the distribution of bioactive and nonbioactive androgen. SHBG-binding capacity is high in prepubertal children, declines during puberty and adulthood, and increases again during the later decades of life. Approximately 40% of testosterone in plasma is bound to SHBG, 2% remains unbound (free) and the rest is bound to albumin and other proteins...(From FDA Label)

Endocrinology,Aredia (pamidronate disodium for injection),"General Information
Aredia has been approved for treatment of osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy. Aredia is the first drug that has been proven to reduce the incidence of skeletal complications of metastatic breast cancer, thereby reducing the need for radiation therapy or surgery to the bone. It has also been shown to provide relief of bone pain caused by metastatic breast cancer, thereby reducing the need for narcotic analgesics. The drug is also indicated for the treatment of osteolytic bone lesions of multiple myeloma, moderate-to-severe hypercalcemia of malignancy, and moderate-to-severe Paget's disease.
Clinical Results
The marketing clearance was based upon data from two large, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies in breast cancer subjects with osteolytic bone metastases. These studies enrolled 372 subjects treated with hormonal therapy and 382 subjects treated with chemotherapy. All subjects enrolled had stage IV breast cancer with two or more lytic lesions, with at least one lesion that was one centimeter or greater in diameter. Subjects were randomized to receive Aredia 90 mg every three to four weeks via two-hour IV infusions for 12 months or matching placebo, in conjunction with either hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. The studies demonstrated that patients receiving Aredia had a significant reduction in skeletal complications, the primary endpoint, and significant relief of bone pain, a secondary endpoint. The Aredia treatment effect appeared to be less pronounced in the study of those receiving chemotherapy. Additionally, subjects receiving Aredia had fewer pathologic fractures and a decreased need for radiation therapy for pain or skeletal complications.
In these studies, skeletal morbidity was defined as the mean number of skeletal complications (pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, radiation therapy, or surgery to bone) per subject per year. In subjects receiving concomitant chemotherapy, Aredia provided a 36% reduction in the skeletal morbidity rate (2.1 vs. 3.3 with placebo). In subjects receiving concomitant hormonal therapy, skeletal morbidity was reduced by 31% with Aredia (2.4 vs. 3.5). For an average subject, these reductions mean one fewer major skeletal complication per year with Aredia.
Additional results of the trials show that subjects treated with Aredia had fewer skeletal complications than those subjects who received placebo. Also, fewer Aredia-treated subjects required radiation therapy for pain, or to prevent or treat fractures, compared to subjects treated with placebo. Among subjects who had pain at the beginning of the trials, Ardia-treated subjects had less severe pain, and experienced pain less often, in comparison to subjects who did not receive Aredia. Additionally, Aredia-treated subjects also had a decreased need for strong pain medication, unlike subjects receiving placebo. The statistical significance of these results may be overstated due to numerous analyses.
","Side Effects
The incidence and type of adverse events with Aredia were similar to those with placebo, with most events likely due to the underlying disease or concomitant antineoplastic therapy. The most frequent adverse events were fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, anemia, and skeletal pain. Transient arthralgias and myalgias were reported slightly more frequently with Aredia than with antineoplastic therapy alone (12% and 23% vs. 8% and 17%, respectively). Serum calcium and electrolytes must be closely monitored, as must subjects with preexisting anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia.
","Additional Information
Breast cancer is diagnosed in approximately 184,000 women each year, and has the highest incidence of associated metastatic bone disease among all cancers.

It is estimated that about 6% of patients with breast cancer in the United States. have advanced breast cancer.
Please Visit Inspire's Community Pages for this drug.","Mechanism of Action
Results from studies suggest that growth of some breast cancer tumors is stimulated by the female hormone estrogen. Arimidex, a nonsteroidal compound, is the first entry in a new class of third-generation selective oral aromatase inhibitors. Inhibition of aromatase reduces the production of estrogen. Thus, Arimidex reduces serum concentration of estrogen, an effect that has been shown to be of benefit in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.
"
Endocrinology,Aromasin Tablets,"General Information
Aromasin, a new drug to treat post-menopausal advanced breast cancer in patients for whom treatment with tamofixen was ineffective, has been shown to inhibit the production of estrogen, upon which some breast cancer cells depend. Furthermore, studies indicate that Aromasin, which reduces the risk of tumor progression by 18 percent and the risk of death by 23 percent, is more beneficial than the hormone therapy, megestrol acetate.
In post-menopausal women, the principle source of estrogen comes from the conversion of adrenal and ovarian androgens to estrogens by the aromatase (exemestane) enzyme. For post-menopausal women with hormone-dependent breast cancer, Aromasin serves as an aromatase inhibitor. As a result, the concentrations of estrogen, on which breast cancer cells may depend, are lowered. This estrogen-depriving process nicknamed, ""suicide inhibition,"" is irreversible. However, it does not affect other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway up to a concentration at least 600 times higher than that inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.
Warnings/Precautions:
Aromasin should not be administered to premenopausal women. Neither should it be coadministered with estrogen-containing agents.
Pregnant women should not take Aromasin, as it could pose a potential hazard to the fetus, and could cause potential loss of the pregnancy.
Aromasin has not yet been tested for pediatric patients.
Clinical Results
A phase III, double blind, randomized study was conducted for 769 post-menopausal patients whose breast cancer had metastasized (spread). The study compared the effects of Aromasin versus those of megestrol acetate on survival, tumor reduction, and duration of disease stabilization. Patients taking megestrol acetate had a median survival (estimated time at which 50 percent of the patients were still alive) of approximately 28 months, while patients taking Aromasin had a median survival significantly longer than 28 months (p< 0.039). Moreover, the progression of cancer was delayed longer in patients taking Aromasin (4.7 months) than in patients taking megestrol acetate (3.8 months). Also, 15 percent of patients treated with Aromasin experienced at least a 50 percent or greater reduction in the size of the tumor or a complete disappearance of all known lesions. This suggested a possible advantage over the 12.4 percent of patients treated with megestrol acetate who experienced this effect, although the difference was not statistically significant. Finally, the regiment for taking Aromasin is one 25mg pill taken daily, versus the 40mg pill of megestrol acetate taken four times daily. Based on the study's results, researchers are confident that Aromasin provides greater benefit than megestrol acetate.
","Side Effects
In clinical trials, any adverse effects were generally described as mild to moderate. Some Aromasin use was associated with low-grade nausea, hot-flashes, fatigue, increased sweating, and increased appetite. However, only 7.6% of patients experienced undesirable weight gain (lower than the rate caused by magestrol acetate).
Warnings/Precautions
Aromasin should not be administered to premenopausal women. Neither should it be coadministered with estrogen-containing agents. Pregnant women should not take Aromasin, as it could pose a potential hazard to the fetus, and could cause potential loss of the pregnancy.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Exemestane is an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator, structurally related to the natural substrate androstenedione. It acts as a false substrate for the aromatase enzyme and is processed to an intermediate that binds irreversibly to the active site of the enzyme causing its inactivation. Exemestane significantly lowers circulating estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women, but has no detectable effect on adrenal biosynthesis of corticosteroids or aldosterone. (FDA Label)"
Endocrinology,Atacand (candesartan cilexetil),"General Information
Atacand HCT (candesartan cilexetil-hydrochlorothiazide) has been developed for the treatment of hypertension, and may be helpful when single products are unsuccessful in reducing blood pressure. Atacand HCT consists of two active ingredients: an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and a diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. It works by inhibiting the effects of angiotensin II, which is an agent that causes vasoconstriction and high blood pressure. Additionally, hydrochlorothiazide reduces blood pressure by improving the kidneys' ability to eliminate salt and fluid from the body. Atacand HCT is available in two tablet strengths: 32 mg Atacand-12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 16 mg Atacand-12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide.
Clinical Results
Five double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluated candesartan cilexetil-hydrochlorothiazide. These five trials, of 8 to 12 weeks duration, consisted of 3037 hypertensive patients. Doses ranged from 2 to 32 mg candesartan cilexetil and from 6.25 to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide administered once daily in various combinations.
The combination of candesartan cilexetil-hydrochlorothiazide resulted in placebo-adjusted decreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 14-18/8-11 mm Hg at doses of 16-12.5 mg and 32-12.5 mg (the two tablet stengths). In long-term studies of up to one year, the blood pressure lowering effect of the combination was maintained.
","Side Effects

Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.
Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium.

Endocrinology,Avandamet (rosiglitazone maleate and metformin HCl),"General Information
Avandamet (rosiglitazone maleate and metformin HCl) has been approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes patients who are already treated with combination rosiglitazone and metformin or who are not adequately controlled on metformin alone.
Avandamet, available in oral tablet formulation, is the first treatment to combine this combination of drugs in one pill.
Clinical Results
Clinical studies have been conducted with the combination of rosiglitazone maleate and metformin HCl, as well as with each component alone. These studies have shown that the products are safe and effective in controlling blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes patients.
No efficacy studies have been conducted for Avandamet tablets. However, Avandamet has been shown to be bioequivalent to co-administered rosiglitazone maleate tablets and metformin hydrochloride tablets.
","Side Effects
In clinical trials of rosiglitazone maleate in combination with metformin hydrochloride 2500 mg/day, the following adverse events were reported most frequently:
Upper respiratory tract infection
Diarrhea
Injury
Anemia
Headache
Sinusitis
Fatigue
Back pain
Viral infection
Arthralgia
Hyperglycemia
A small number of people who have been treated with metformin have developed the serious yet rare condition called lactic acidosis (a build up of lactic acid in the blood). Most often, lactic acidosis occurs in people with kidney problems, and it can be fatal.
Rosiglitazone may cause fluid retention, especially if it is used with insulin. Untreated fluid retention could lead to or worsen heart failure.
Avandamet should not be used with insulin, and should not be used by patients with kidney disease, congestive heart failure, or liver disease.
","Additional Information
For more information about Avandamet, please visit the GlaxoSmithKline web site at www.gsk.com.","Mechanism of Action
Rosiglitazone maleate is a member of the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic agents and is a PPARgamma agonist. It improves glycemic control by improving insulin sensitivity while reducing circulating insulin levels.
Metformin hydrochloride is a member of the biguanide class of antidiabetic agents. It decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged, while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease. (from FDA prescription label)

Endometrial Cancer,Keytruda (pembrolizumab) plus Lenvima (lenvatinib),"General Information
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is an anti-PD-1 therapy. Lenvima (lenvatinib) is an orally available kinase inhibitor.
The Keytruda plus Lenvima combination is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.
Keytruda is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion. Lenvima is supplied as a capsule for oral administration.
The recommended dosage of Keytruda plus Lenvima for endometrial carcinoma is as follows: Keytruda 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks in combination with Lenvima 20 mg orally once daily until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for Keytruda, up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Refer to the Lenvima prescribing information for recommended dosing information, as appropriate.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Keytruda was based on data from KEYNOTE-146/Study 111, a Phase 2, multi-cohort, multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial that enrolled 108 patients with metastatic endometrial carcinoma that had progressed following at least one prior systemic therapy in any setting. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients were treated with Keytruda 200 mg intravenously every three weeks in combination with Lenvima 20 mg orally once daily until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression as determined by the investigator.
Administration of Keytruda plus Lenvima was permitted beyond Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered by the investigator to be deriving clinical benefit. Keytruda dosing was continued for a maximum of 24 months; however, treatment with Lenvima could be continued beyond 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline and then every six weeks until week 24, followed by every nine weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) by independent radiologic review committee (IRC) using RECIST 1.1.
Among the 108 patients, 87% (n=94) had tumors that were not MSI-H or dMMR, 10% (n=11) had tumors that were MSI-H or dMMR, and 3% (n=3) had tumors that had unknown status. In the 94 patients with tumors that were not MSI-H or dMMR, the Keytruda plus Lenvima combination demonstrated an ORR of 38.3%, with a complete response rate of 10.6% (n=10) and a partial response rate of 27.7% (n=26). The median follow-up time was 18.7 months. In the patients who had a response as determined by independent review (n=36), at the time of data cutoff, the median DOR was not reached (range: 1.2+ to 33.1+ months), and 69% of these patients experienced responses lasting six months or greater.

Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the bodyâ€™s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. Keytruda is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
Lenvima (lenvatinib) is a kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvima inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRÎ±), KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, lenvatinib decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone.

Endometriosis,Orilissa (elagolix),"General Information
Orilissa (elagolix) is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist.
Orilissa is specifically indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis.
Orilissa is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. Exclude pregnancy before starting Orilissa or start Orilissa within 7 days from the onset of menses. Take Orilissa at approximately the same time each day, with or without food. Use the lowest effective dose, taking into account the severity of symptoms and treatment objectives. Limit the duration of use because of bone loss. In patients with normal liver function or mild hepatic impairment, the recommended dose is 150 mg once daily for up to 24 months or 200 mg twice daily for up to 6 months. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment the recommended dose is 150 mg once daily for up to 6 months.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Orilissa was based on two multinational double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 1,686 premenopausal women [Study EM-1 and Study EM-2]. The efficacy of Orilissa 150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice daily was evaluated for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were (1) the proportion of subjects whose dysmenorrhea responded to treatment at Month 3 and (2) the proportion of subjects whose pelvic pain not related to menses (also known as non-menstrual pelvic pain) responded to treatment at Month 3. A higher proportion of women treated with Orilissa 150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice daily were responders for daily menstrual pain and non-menstrual pelvic pain compared to placebo in a dose-dependent manner at month three. Women were defined as responders if they experienced a reduction in daily menstrual pain and non-menstrual pelvic pain with no increase in analgesic use for endometriosis-associated pain. Both Orilissa treatment groups showed statistically significant greater mean decreases from baseline compared to placebo in daily menstrual pain and non-menstrual pelvic pain at month six. Patients in the studies also provided a daily self-assessment of their endometriosis pain using a numeric rating scale (NRS). The women taking Orilissa 150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice daily reported a statistically significant reduction from baseline in NRS scores compared to placebo at month three. Clinical trial data also demonstrated women taking Orilissa 200 mg twice daily showed statistically significant greater reduction in pain with sex from baseline to month three compared to placebo.

Epilepsy,Depakote (divalproex sodium),"General Information
Depakote has been approved for the treatment of complex partial seizures (CPS), a common type of epilepsy. This is a new indication for Depakote, which has already been approved for the treatment of migraine headaches. The new indication for treatment of CPS includes using Depakote as a sole agent (monotherapy) or as adjunctive therapy for use with other anti-epilepsy drugs. Both Depakote tablets and sprinkle capsules can be used for treatment.
Clinical Results
Depakote-treated subjects showed significant improvement by reducing seizure frequency. This improvement was established in clinical trials with Depakote as adjunctive or monotherapy conducted with subjects who continued to experience seizures while taking their current epilepsy medication. Seizure frequency was calculated to reflect the median number of seizures during an eight-week measurement period versus an eight-week treatment period with Depakote.
","Side Effects
In clinical trials, Depakote was generally well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. Common adverse events were nausea, tremor, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, abdominal pain, and anorexia. Other important safety considerations include the possibility of hepatic failure, which has resulted in fatalities in subjects receiving valproic acid and its derivatives, usually occurring during the first six months of treatment. Valproic acid may produce teratogenic effects in the offspring of women receiving the drug during pregnancy, Thrombocytopenia, an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, has also been associated with Depakote use. The incidence of thrombocytopenia appears to be dose related.
","Additional Information
Approximately 2.5 million people in the United States have some form of epilepsy and an estimated 125,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Depakote has been marketed in the United States since 1983 as a treatment for simple and complex absence seizures.",
Epilepsy,Fycompa (perampanel),"General Information
Fycompa (perampanel) is a selective AMPA-type glutamate receptor antagonist. The AMPA receptor is widely present most excitatory neuronal synapses and plays a role in a large number of central nervous system diseases.
Fycompa is specifically indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondarily generalized seizures in patients with epilepsy 4 years of age and older and as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older.
Fycompa is supplied as a tablet for oral administration or as an oral suspension. The recommended dose is a follows:
Dosage for Partial-Onset Seizures:
Monotherapy or Adjunctive Therapy: The recommended starting dosage of Fycompa in adults and pediatric patients 4 years of age and older is 2 mg once daily taken orally at bedtime. Increase dosage no more frequently than at weekly intervals by increments of 2 mg once daily based on individual clinical response and tolerability.
The recommended maintenance dose range is 8 mg to 12 mg once daily, although some patients may respond to a dose of 4 mg daily. A dose of 12 mg once daily resulted in somewhat greater reductions in seizure rates than the dose of 8 mg once daily, but with a substantial increase in adverse reactions.
Dosage adjustment is recommended with concomitant use of moderate or strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducing drugs, which include certain antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Please see drug label for specific instructions.
Dosage for Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures:
Adjunctive Therapy The recommended starting dosage of Fycompa in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is 2 mg once daily taken orally at bedtime. Increase dosage no more frequently than at weekly intervals by increments of 2 mg once daily based on individual clinical response and tolerability.
The recommended maintenance dose is 8 mg once daily taken at bedtime. Patients who are tolerating Fycompa at 8 mg once daily and require further reduction of seizures may benefit from a dose increase up to 12 mg once daily if tolerated.
Dosage adjustment is recommended with concomitant use of moderate or strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducing drugs, which include certain AEDs. Please see drug label for specific instructions.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Partial-Onset Seizures: The FDA approval was based on three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3) in 1,037 adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. All trials had an initial 6-week baseline period, during which patients were required to have more than five seizures in order to be randomized. This was followed by a 19 week treatment period consisting of a 6 week titration phase and a 13 week maintenance phase. The median baseline seizure frequency ranged from 9.3 to 14.3 seizures per 28 days. The primary endpoint was the percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days during the treatment period as compared to the baseline period. A statistically significant decrease in seizure rate was observed at doses of 4 to 12 mg per day. Dose response was apparent at 4 to 8 mg with little additional reduction in frequency at 12 mg per day. For combined data, the percentages of patients with a 40 to <60% reduction in seizure frequency were 13.2%, 17.4%, 19.0%, and 15.8% for placebo, 4, 8, and 12 mg, respectively. The percentages of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency were 19.3%, 28.5%, 35.3%, 35.0% for placebo, 4, 8, and 12 mg, respectively.
Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic (PGTC) Seizures: The FDA approval of Fycompa as adjunctive therapy in patients 12 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures was based on one multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 4), conducted at 78 sites in 16 countries. Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 to 3 AEDs experiencing at least 3 primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures during the 8-week baseline period were randomized to either Fycompa or placebo. Efficacy was analyzed in 162 patients (Fycompa N=81, placebo N=81) who received medication and at least one post-treatment seizure assessment. Patients were titrated over 4 weeks up to a dose of 8 mg per day or the highest tolerated dose and treated for an additional 13 weeks on the last dose level achieved at the end of the titration period. The total treatment period was 17 weeks. Study drug was given once per day. The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in primary generalized tonic-clonic seizure frequency per 28 days during the treatment period as compared to the baseline period. A statistically significant decrease in seizure rate was observed with Fycompa compared to placebo.
The use of Fycompa for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adolescents and children 4 to <12 years with epilepsy is supported by efficacy extrapolated from three Phase 3 adequate and well-controlled studies of Fycompa in adult patients with partial-onset seizures. Safety was evaluated in two studies in pediatric patients 4 to <12 years of age with epilepsy, a total of 225 patients received Fycompa, with 110 patients exposed for at least 6 months, and 21 patients for at least 1 year. Adverse reactions in pediatric patients 4 to <12 years of age were similar to those seen in patients 12 years of age and older.

Epilepsy,Keppra,"General Information
Keppra is an antiepileptic drug to be used as an adjunctive therapy in adult patients with epilepsy for whom current therapies have not been effective in controlling partial seizures. Partial seizures, which are the most common type of seizures in adults, may be characterized by impaired consciousness, loss of awareness, involuntary motor behaviors, and other non-conscious, involuntary events. For physicians and patients, the attraction of Keppra is that it increases seizure control without adverse interaction with co-administered antiepileptic drugs.
Epilepsy is caused by excessive electrical activity in the brain. Those who suffer from the disorder (2.3 million in America alone) experience recurring seizures. Even with treatment, only about 50% of epilepsy patients have complete control of their seizures, and 600,000 patients do not respond at all to the previously available therapies.
Clinical Results
Three clinical studies compared 3 distinct dosages of Keppra (1000 mg/day, 2000 mg/day, or 3000 mg/day) with a placebo. All of the 1393 epilepsy patients who participated in the trials had continued to experience seizures during the baseline period despite their being treated with 1-2 antiepileptic drugs. Concomitant AED regimens were held constant during administration of Keppra. Effectiveness of the Keppra therapy was measured primarily by reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency for the entire treatment period.
Results of the trials indicated that Keppra significantly reduces the weekly seizure frequency over a placebo. Percent reduction ranged from 17.1% to 30.1% depending on the study number and the dose of Keppra in the treatment. In general, higher doses yielded greater reduction in number of seizures, although results varied over trials.
Another appealing result of the trials was the overall lack of negative interaction when taken in conjunction with other AEDs.
","Side Effects
Although Keppra was well tolerated by participants, the following adverse events were reported during trials:
somnolence
asthenia (lack or loss of strength)
infection
dizziness
15% of patients receiving Keppra, compared to 11.6% of patients receiving the placebo treatment discontinued therapy or had the dose reduced as a result of an adverse effect.
Exercise caution when giving Keppra to patients with moderate and severe renal impairment and patients undergoing hemodialysis, since levetiracetam is substantially excreted by the kidney.
","Additional Information
This is what the Epilepsy Foundation says to do and not to do if you encounter a person having an epileptic seizure:
What To Do:
Look for medical identification.
Protect from nearby hazards.
Loosen ties or shirt collars.
Protect head from injury.
Turn on side to keep airway clear unless injury exists.
Reassure as consciousness returns.
If a single seizure lasted less than 5 minutes, ask if hospital evaluation wanted.
If there are multiple seizures, or if one seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, call an ambulance.
If person is pregnant, injured, or diabetic, call for aid at once.
What Not To Do:
Don't put any hard implement in the mouth.
Don't try to hold tongue. It can't be swallowed.
Don't try to give liquids during or just after seizure,
Don't use artificial respiration unless breathing is absent after muscle jerks subside, or unless water has been inhaled.
Don't restrain.","Mechanism of Action
Keppra is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and food does not affect the extent of bioavailability. Pharmacokinetics are linear and steady state is achieved after two days of multiple twice daily dosing. Keppra is not protein bound (<10 percent bound) and its metabolism is not liver cytochrome P450 dependent, with sixty-six percent (66 percent) of the dose renally excreted unchanged. Plasma half-life of the medication is approximately 6 to 8 hours but is increased in the elderly (due to age-related decrease in renal function) and in patients with renal impairment. Keppra is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic drug interactions. (From Doctor's Guide to Medical and Other News)

Epilepsy,Nayzilam (midazolam),"General Information
Nayzilam (midazolam) is a benzodiazepine.
Nayzilam is specifically indicated for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patientâ€™s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older.
Nayzilam is supplied as a spray for intranasal administration. The following should be considered prior to initiation of treatment:
â€¢ For patients at increased risk of respiratory depression from benzodiazepines, administration of Nayzilam under healthcare professional supervision should be considered prior to treatment with Nayzilam; this administration may be performed in the absence of a seizure episode.
â€¢ Prior to treatment, the healthcare professional should instruct the individual administering Nayzilam on how to identify seizure clusters and use the product appropriately. Patients and caregivers should be counseled to read carefully the â€œInstructions for Useâ€� for complete directions on how to properly administer Nayzilam.
The recommended dose is as follows: Initial Dose: Administer one spray (5 mg dose) into one nostril. Second Dose (if needed): One additional spray (5 mg dose) into the opposite nostril may be administered after 10 minutes if the patient has not responded to the initial dose. A second dose of Nayzilam should not be administered if the patient has trouble breathing or if there is excessive sedation that is uncharacteristic of the patient during a seizure cluster episode. Maximum Dosage and Treatment Frequency: Do not use more than 2 doses of Nayzilam to treat a single episode. It is recommended that Nayzilam be used to treat no more than one episode every three days and no more than 5 episodes per month
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Nayzilam for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patientâ€™s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older was based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial enrolled patients with epilepsy on a stable regimen of antiepileptic drugs who were identified by their physicians as having intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity that were distinct from the patientâ€™s usual seizure pattern. The study was conducted in two phases: an open-label Test Dose Phase followed by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Comparative Phase. In the Test Dose Phase, tolerability was assessed in 292 patients who, in the absence of a seizure, received two 5 mg doses of Nayzilam (10 mg total dosage) separated by 10 minutes. Patients were excluded from participation in the Comparative Phase if they failed to meet pre-defined blood pressure, heart rate, sedation, electrocardiogram, and peripheral oxygen saturation criteria. In the Comparative Phase, 201 patients treated a single seizure cluster episode in an outpatient setting with either a blinded dose of Nayzilam 5 mg (134 patients) or placebo (67 patients). If the seizure activity persisted or recurred, patients in both groups had the option to receive a subsequent unblinded dose of Nayzilam 5 mg to be used between 10 minutes and 6 hours after administration of the initial blinded dose of study drug. The primary efficacy endpoint was treatment success, defined as the termination of seizures within 10 minutes after the initial blinded dose of study drug and the absence of a recurrence of seizures within 6 hours of the initial blinded dose of study drug. A statistically significantly higher percentage of Nayzilam-treated patients met the primary efficacy endpoint. Numerical differences in favor of Nayzilam were observed on each of the components of the treatment success responder definition; termination of seizure(s) within 10 minutes after initial dose of study drug (80.6 versus 70.1%) and the absence of seizure recurrence between 10 minutes and 6 hours after the initial dose of study drug (58.2 versus 37.3%).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Nayzilam may include, but are not limited to, the following:
somnolence
headache
nasal discomfort
throat irritation
rhinorrhea
The Nayzilam drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Nayzilam or intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity, please visit the Nayzilam page","Mechanism of Action
Nayzilam (midazolam) is a benzodiazepine. The exact mechanism of action for midazolam is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission resulting from binding at the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor.

Epilepsy,Neurontin (gabapentin) oral solution,"General Information
Neurontin is an anticonvulsant indicated for use as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures in adults with epilepsy. This newly approved oral solution form of the drug has bioequivalence to the capsule form of the Neurontin, which was approved in January 1999. The two dosage forms have the same indications.
Neurontin may be taken with or without food.
If you take antacids (such as Maalox or Mylanta), you should wait at least two hours after antacid use before taking gabapentin.
Clinical Results
705 adults with partial seizures were patients in clinical studies. Previous to clinical trials, all of these patients had at least 4 partial seizures a month, despite the use of one or more antiepileptic drugs. In three multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials, Neurontin was administered concurrently with the existing therapy. Reduction of frequency of partial seizures was significantly reduced in patients taking Neurontin 1200 mg/day, compared to placebo.
In a second study, patients taking 1200 mg/day Neurontin had greater reduction in seizure frequency than did those taking the placebo, however the difference was not statistically significant. The same was the case for 600 mg/day of Neurontin. On the other hand, 1800 mg/day yielded significantly greater reduction in seizure frequency than placebo.
Several studies also indicated that Neurontin was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
In general, higher doses of Neurontin yielded greater reduction in frequency of seizures.
","Side Effects
In clinical studies the most common side effects associated with Neurontin were:
Drowsiness (19.3% vs 8.7% for patients taking placebo
Fatigue (11% vs 5% with placebo)
Dizziness (17.1% vs 6.9% with placebo)
Involuntary rhythmic eye movement (8.3% vs 4.0% with placebo)
Problems with muscular coordination (12.5% vs 5.6% with placebo)
The above side effects reportedly lasted approximately 2 weeks within clinical trials.
During postmarketing development of Neurontin, 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among 2203 patients.
","Additional Information
This is what the Epilepsy Foundation says to do and not to do if you encounter a person having an epileptic seizure:
What To Do:
Look for medical identification.
Protect from nearby hazards.
Loosen ties or shirt collars.
Protect head from injury.
Turn on side to keep airway clear unless injury exists.
Reassure as consciousness returns.
If a single seizure lasted less than 5 minutes, ask if hospital evaluation wanted.
If there are multiple seizures, or if one seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, call an ambulance.
If person is pregnant, injured, or diabetic, call for aid at once.
What Not To Do:
Don't put any hard implement in the mouth.
Don't try to hold tongue. It can't be swallowed.
Don't try to give liquids during or just after seizure,
Don't use artificial respiration unless breathing is absent after muscle jerks subside, or unless water has been inhaled.
Don't restrain.
Please Visit Inspire's Community Pages for this drug.","Mechanism of Action
The mechanism by which gabapentin exerts its anticonvulsant action is unknown, but in animal test systems designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, gabapentin prevents seizures as do other marketed anticonvulsants. Gabapentin exhibits antiseizure activity in mice and rats in both the maximal electroshock and pentylenetetrazole seizure models and other preclinical models (e.g., strains with genetic epilepsy, etc.). The relevance of these models to human epilepsy is not known.
Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) but it does not interact with GABA receptors, it is not metabolically into GABA or a GABA agonist, and it is not an inhibitor of GABA uptake or degradationâ€¦ (From FDA Label)

Epilepsy,Oxtellar XR (oxcarbazepine extended release),"General Information
Oxtellar XR is an extended release, once daily formulation of oxcarbazepine, a currently approved anti-epileptic drug. Oxcarbazepine produces blockade of voltage-sensitive sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcited neural membranes, inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing, and diminution of propagation of synaptic impulses. These actions are thought to be important in the prevention of seizure spread in the intact brain.
Oxtellar XR is specifically indicated as adjunctive therapy of partial seizures in adults and in children 6 years to 17 years of age.
Oxtellar XR is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. Oxtellar XR should be administered as a single daily dose taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after meals). The tablets should be swallowed whole. The recommended daily dose of Oxtellar XR is as follows:
Adults
1,200 mg to 2,400 mg per day, given once daily. Initiate treatment at a dose of 600 mg per day given once daily for one week. Subsequent dose increases can be made at weekly intervals in 600 mg per day increments to achieve the recommended daily dose.
Pediatrics 6 to 17 years of Age
Initiate treatment at a daily dose of 8 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg once daily, not to exceed 600 mg per day in the first week. Subsequent dose increases can be made at weekly intervals in 8 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg increments once daily, not to exceed 600 mg, to achieve the target maintenance daily dose, based on weight.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Oxtellar XR for the treatment of partial seizures in pediatrics was based on adequate and well-controlled studies of Oxtellar XR in adults, along with clinical trials of immediate-release oxcarbazepine in children, and on pharmacokinetic evaluations of the use of Oxtellar XR in children.
Oxtellar XR Primary Trial
The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm, parallel-group study enrolled 366 adults with refractory partial epilepsy. All subjects had at least three partial seizures per 28 days during an 8 week Baseline Period, were receiving treatment with at least one to three antiepileptic drugs and were on stable treatment for a minimum of 4 weeks. The subjects received Oxtellar XR (1200 or 2400 mg/day) or placebo. The treatment period included a 4 week Titration Phase followed by a 12 week Maintenance Phase. The primary endpoint of the study was median percentage change from baseline in seizure frequency per 28 days during the treatment period relative to the baseline period. The results are as follows: Oxtellar XR 1200mg/day: -38.2 % (p=0.078), Oxtellar XR 2400mg/day: -42.9 % (p=0.003) and placebo: -28.7 %.
Immediate-Release Oxcarbazepine Adjunctive Therapy Trials
The effectiveness of immediate-release oxcarbazepine as an adjunctive therapy for partial seizures in adults was demonstrated at doses of 600mg per day, 1200mg per day and 2400mg per day (divided twice daily) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. All doses resulted in a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency when compared to placebo (p<0.05). The effectiveness of immediate-release oxcarbazepine in doses of 30-46 mg/kg/day, depending on baseline weight, as an adjunctive therapy for partial seizures in children 3 years to 17 years of age was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Oxcarbazepine in the single weight based dose group resulted in a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency when compared to placebo (p<0.05).

Epilepsy,Tegretol (carbamazepine),"General Information
Tegretol, an anticonvulsant drug used for more than 25 years in the United States, has received FDA approval for use in children under six years of age. Tegretol is indicated as a first-line monotherapy for the treatment of partial, secondarily generalized, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures in children and adults. The medication is available in scored tablets, chewable tablets, and liquid suspension forms.
Clinical Results
The safety of carbamazepine in children has systemically been studied in clinical trials up to six months. Longer-term data is not available.
","Side Effects
The most frequently observed adverse reactions, particularly during the initial phases of therapy, are dizziness, drowsiness, unsteadiness, nausea, and vomiting. Although reports of transient or persistent decreased platelet or white blood cell counts are not uncommon in association with the use of Tegretol, the vast majority of cases of leukopenia have not progressed to the more serious conditions of aplastic anemia or agranulocytosis.
","Additional Information
Epileptic seizures are caused by a sudden and unusual discharge of electrical energy in the brain. It is estimated that 13%--or more than 300,000--of the 2.5 million Americans with epilepsy are children under the age of 18, according to the Epilepsy Foundation of America. Twenty-five percent of all cases develop before the child reaches the age of five.",
Epilepsy,Tegretol XR (carbamazepine),"General Information
Tegretol-XR has been approved as a treatment for epileptic seizures. It is a new formulation that will allow many subjects to switch from three or four daily doses to a more convenient twice-daily regimen. Available only by prescription in 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg tablets, Tegretol-XR is indicated as a first-line monotherapy for the treatment of partial, secondarily generalized, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
","Side Effects
The most frequently observed adverse reactions with Tegretol-XR therapy, particularly during the initial phases of therapy, are dizziness, drowsiness, unsteadiness, nausea and vomiting. To minimize the possibility of such reactions, therapy should be initiated at the lowest possible dose. Although reports of transient or persistent decreased platelet or white blood cells are not uncommon in association with the use of Tegretol, the vast majority of cases of leukopenia have not progressed to the more serious conditions of aplastic anemia or agranulocytosis. When initiating therapy with Tegretol-XR, physicians should obtain complete pretreatment hematologic testing as a baseline. As with all anticonvulsant therapy, periodic hematologic evaluations are recommended at the physician's discretion. Physicians should monitor subject's plasma levels during conversion to Tegretol-XR or whenever any anticonvulsant therapy formulation is changed.",,
Epilepsy,Trileptal (oxcarbazepine) Tablets,"General Information
Trileptal, an anticonvulsant or antiepileptic drug (AED), was approved for use as an adjunctive and monotherapy for the treatment of partial seizures in adults with epilepsy and for the adjunctive treatment of partial seizures in children, ages 4-16, with epilepsy. It is the first AED to be approved as a monotherapy in several years.
2.3 million Americans have been diagnosed with epilepsy. This year, 181,000 more Americans (children and adults) will develop epilepsy and seizures.
Clinical Results
Recent trials include 6 multi-center randomized double blind controlled trials that were conducted to determine the effectiveness of the drug. 4 of the studies investigated the drug as a monotherapy. Participants in these trials ranged from 8 to 66 years old. Two of the studies tested the drug as an adjunctive therapy.
In studies in which the drug was compared to a placebo, patients given the drug lasted significantly longer without having certain seizures than did those patients not taking the drug.
Furthermore, a higher dosage of the drug yielded a significantly longer period before the patient demonstrated specific seizure symptoms.
In addition, two trials, one in which patients were ages 15-66 and the other in which patients were ages 3-17, examined Trileptal as an adjunctive therapy. Every patient in these trials was on 1-3 concomitant Anti-Epileptic Drugs. In both studies, dosage was increased over a period of two weeks until the patient reached the assigned dose or experienced an intolerance to the dosage.
Results of the pediatric trial indicated that compared to a placebo, patients taking the study medication experienced over 25% greater reduction of frequency of partial seizures.
In the adult study, the reduction of frequency of partial seizures for those taking the study drug at the lowest dose was over 18% greater than those taking the placebo, while at the highest dose was over 42% greater than those taking the placebo.
","Side Effects
The most common side effects include, but are not limited to:
Headache
Somnolence or fatigue
Dizziness
Viral Infection
Nausea
Some patients also exhibited hyponatremia (low serum sodium levels). Most patients who developed this side effect, were asymptomatic. In clinical trials, patients whose treatment was discontinued due to hyponatremia, generally experienced normalization of serum sodium within a few days without additional treatment.
Some additional side effects were associated with the central nervous system (CNS). These include:
Psychomotor slowing
Difficulty with concentration
Speech or language problems
Coordination abnormalities
In clinical trials, patients' discontinuation of therapy due to these CNS side effects was dose related when the drug was used as an adjunctive therapy; higher dosages increased the discontinuation rate. No discontinuation of treatment due to similar side effects was found when the drug was used as a monotherapy.
Contraindications:
Trileptal should not be used in patients with a known hypersensitivity to oxcarbazepine or to any of its components.

Epilepsy,Vimpat (lacosamide),"General Information
Vimpat is an orally-available anticonvulsant. It selectively enhances slow inactivation of sodium channels and interacts with the neuroplasticity-relevant target -collapsin-response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2).
Vimpat tablets are specifically indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients with epilepsy aged 17 years and older. Vimpat injection for intravenous use is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients with epilepsy aged 17 years and older when oral administration is temporarily not feasible.
Vimpat is supplied as a tablet designed for oral administration or as a solution designed for intravenous administration. The recommended initial dose is 50 mg twice daily (100 mg per day). Vimpat can be increased at weekly intervals by 100 mg/day given as two divided doses up to the recommended maintenance dose of 200 to 400 mg/day.
Switching from oral to intravenous dosing
The initial total daily intravenous dosage of Vimpat should be equivalent to the total daily dosage and frequency of oral Vimpat and should be infused intravenously over a period of 30 to 60 minutes.
Switching from intravenous to oral dosing
At the end of the intravenous treatment period, the patient may be switched to Vimpat oral administration at the equivalent daily dosage and frequency of the intravenous administration.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Vimpat was based on the results of three clinical trials. These 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials enrolled subjects with partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization and who were not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs. Study 1 compared doses of Vimpat 200 , 400 , and 600 mg/day with placebo. Study 2 compared doses of Vimpat 400 and 600 mg/day with placebo. Study 3 compared doses of Vimpat 200 and 400 mg/day with placebo. Following an 8-week baseline phase to establish baseline seizure frequency prior to randomization, subjects were randomized and titrated to the randomized dose. During the titration phase in all thrree trials, treatment was initiated at 100 mg/day (50 mg given twice daily) and increased in weekly increments of 100 mg/day to the target dose. The Titration Phase lasted 6 weeks in Study 1 and Study 2 and 4 weeks in Study 3. In all three trials, the Titration Phase was followed by a Maintenance Phase that lasted 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was reduction in 28 day seizure frequency (Baseline to Maintenance Phase) as compared to the placebo group. A statistically significant effect was observed with Vimpat treatment at doses of 200 mg/day (Study 3), 400 mg/day (Studies 1, 2, and 3), and 600 mg/day (Studies 1 and 2).

Epilepsy,Zonegran (zonisamide) Capsules,"General Information
Zonegran is indicated for use as an adjunctive therapy for treatment of partial seizures (or focal seizures) in adults with epilepsy.
Zonegran, which has been available in Japan since 1989 under the trade name of Excegran, will be available on the U.S. market in May, 2000.
Epilepsy is a neurological dysfunction in which sudden and excessive bursts of electrical energy are emitted in the brain. Among the several different general categories of seizures are partial seizures, seizures resulting from electricity in local neuron populations; and generalized seizures, which occur in more general areas of the brain and often cause more serious symptoms. There are an estimated 2 million epilepsy sufferers in the U.S. alone. Approximately one third of these patients do not have sufficient control of their seizures with the anti-epileptic drugs currently available to them.
Clinical Results
Three multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies examined the effects of the investigational drug as an adjunctive therapy in 499 patients with partial onset seizures for whom one or two antiepileptic drugs were ineffective. The primary measure of effectiveness was median percent reduction in seizure frequency.
In the first study, two dose escalation regimens were studied. Treatment with Zonegran was statistically significant for doses of 100, 200, or 400 mg/day, but not for 300 mg/day, when compared to placebo.
In the second study, varied doses of Zonegran or placebo were administered twice daily, while in the third study, they were administered once daily. In both studies, results indicated that Zonegran 400-600 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo in weeks 5-12 of the study. No significant differences were found between once and twice daily dosing. Results also suggested that 100 and 400 mg/day were significantly effective in the first 4 weeks of the study during which only secondary comparisons were made.
Approximately 27% of patients treated with Zonegran experienced 75% or more reduction in seizure frequency, while only 12% of placebo-treated patients experienced such reduction.
","Side Effects
Common side effects of Zonegran include but are not limited to:
Renal calculi
Drowsiness
Ataxia
Loss of appetite
Gastrointestinal symptoms
Possible rare but serious side effects of Zonegran include but are not limited to:
Severe rash (i.e. Stevens Johnson Syndrome [SJS] and toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN])
Serious hematologic events, such as aplastic anemia or agranuclocytosis
Oligohydrosis and hyperthermia in pediatric patients

Don't restrain.","Mechanism of Action
The precise mechanism(s) by which zonisamide exerts its antiseizure effect is unknown. Zonisamide demonstrated anticonvulsant activity in several experimental models. In animals, zonisamide was effective against tonic extension seizures induced by maximal electroshock but ineffective against clonic seizures induced by subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol. Zonisamide raised the threshold for generalized seizures in the kindled rat model and reduced the duration of cortical focal seizures induced by electrical stimulation of the visual cortex in cats. Furthermore, zonisamide suppressed both interictal spikes and the secondarily generalized seizures produced by cortical application of tungstic acid gel in rats or by cortical freezing in cats. The relevance of these models to human epilepsy is unknown.
Zonisamide may produce these effects through action at sodium and calcium channels. In vitro pharmacological studies suggest that zonisamide blocks sodium channels and reduces voltage-dependent, transient inward currents (T-type Ca2+ currents), consequently stabilizing neuronal membranes and suppressing neuronal hypersynchronization. In vitro binding studies have demonstrated that zonisamide binds to the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor ionophore complex in an allosteric fashion which does not produce changes in chloride flux. Other in vitro studies have demonstrated that zonisamide (10-30 ug/mL) suppresses synaptically-driven electrical activity without affecting postsynaptic GABA or glutamate responses (cultured mouse spinal cord neurons) or neuronal or glial uptake of [3H]-GABA (rat hippocampal slices). Thus, zonisamide does not appear to potentiate the synaptic activity of GABA. In vivo microdialysis studies demonstrated that zonisamide facilitates both dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. Zonisamide also has weak carbonic anhydrase inhibiting activity, but this pharmacologic effect is not thought to be a major contributing factor in the antiseizure activity of zonisamide.

Erectile Dysfunction,Cialis (tadalafil),"General Information
Cialis (tadalafil) is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) for the treatment for erectile dysfunction. Tadalafil along with sildenafil (Viagra, Pfizer) and vardenafil (Levitra, Bayer), belongs to a class of smooth muscle relaxants called phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors.
It is approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction for up to 36 hours after dosing.
The recommended dose of Cialis is 10 mg, taken prior to anticipated sexual activity. The dose may be increased to 20 mg or decreased to 5 mg.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Cialis was based on 2 U.S. and 5 international randomized, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials. In total, Cialis has been evaluated in over 4,000 subjects. The primary outcome measures were the Erectile Function (EF) domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and Questions 2 and 3 from Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP). The IIEF is a 4-week recall questionnaire administered at the end of a treatment-free baseline period and at follow-up visits after enrollment. The IIEF EF domain has a 30-point total score, where higher scores reflect better erectile function. SEP is a diary in which subjects recorded each sexual attempt made during the study.
Results of the 2 U.S. trials demonstrated meaningful and statistically significant improvements in all efficacy variables, with positive effects being maintained over time. The trial enrolled 402 subjects, with an average age of 59 years, experiencing erectile dysfunction (ED). Cialis doses ranged from 2.5 to 20 mg, once daily as needed.
Results of the 5 international studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all 3 primary efficacy variables. Treatment effects did not diminish over time. In addition, data showed patient-reported improvement in erections across subjects with ED of all degrees of severity while taking Cialis, compared to placebo. The efficacy and safety studies enrolled 1112 subjects, with a mean age of 59. The trials included subjects with ED and with multiple conditions, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Cialis may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Headache
Dyspepsia
Back pain
Myalgia
Nasal congestion
Flushing
Pain in limb
","Additional Information
For additional information about Cialis or erectile dysfunction, please contact The Cialis Web Site","Mechanism of Action
Erections are caused by increased blood flow from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. Cyclic GMP (cGMP) causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. During sexual stimulation, tadalafil will inhibit phosphodiesterase type 5 PDE5, which increases the amount of cGMP in smooth muscles cells thus enhancing erectile function.

Erectile Dysfunction,INFANRIX (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed),"General Information
INFANRIX has been approved as new vaccine for infants and children. INFANRIX is indicated for active immunization against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) in infants and children 6 weeks to 7 years of age (prior to seventh birthday).
Clinical Results
INFANRIX, which contains three pertussis antigens (pertactin (PRN), pertussis toxoid (PT) and filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA)) demonstrated an absolute efficacy of 89 percent in preventing pertussis in a German household contact study. Furthermore, INFANRIX is the only acellular DTP proven more effective at 84 percent than a whole-cell DTP (36 percent effective). INFANRIX also includes antigens to protect against two other childhood diseases (diphtheria and tetanus). INFANRIX demonstrated a superior safety profile as compared to that of whole-cell DTP vaccines. Whole-cell vaccines, although effective, are associated with relatively high rates of side effects. Acellular vaccines such as INFANRIX cause significantly fewer local and systemic reactions.
The National Institute of Health pertussis trials conducted in 1992-95 were a benchmark in the evaluation of acellular pertussis vaccines. The efficacy and safety of acellular vaccines were well established in the trials, which were conducted in Italy and Sweden and together enrolled more than 25,000 children. The trials were randomized, double-blinded with a whole-cell DTP control group and a placebo control group. Results of the trials, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine in February, 1996, supported SBâ€™s choice of a three-component vaccine.
The Swedish study (N = 9,829) found a two-component (PT and FHA) acellular DTO manufactured by SB to be 59 percent effective. The whole-cell DTP vaccine was found to be 48 percent effective.
In the Italian study (N = 14,751), INFANRIX, containing three pertussis antigens, PT, FHA and pertactin, was found to be 84 percent effective against WHO-defined typical pertussis (21 days or more of paroxysmal cough plus laboratory confirmation). The Italian study confirmed the superior efficacy of INFANRIX by demonstrating that it is more effective than a U.S. licensed whole-cell vaccine which was proven 36 percent effective.
Although the role of the pertussis antigens in providing protection is not well understood, the NIH trials which evaluated candidate acellular DTPs manufactured by SB Biologicals supported the efficacy of three-component INFANRIX.
The superior efficacy of INFANRIX was confirmed in a large, blinded, prospective household contact study that enrolled more than 22,000 infants in six different areas in Germany. INFANRIX demonstrated a protective efficacy of 89 percent for WHO-defined typical pertussis. This study was free of detectable bias from potentially confounding factors (age, socioeconomic status, family size and erythromycin treatment) and was conducted under stringent conditions. These findings were published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in January 1996.
",,"Additional Information
Pertussis (whooping cough) is caused by infection of the respiratory tract by the Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis and is highly contagious. pertussis causes violent spells of coughing that may be followed by difficulty in breathing. Symptoms progress to paroxysmal coughs followed by a long, deep breath (""whoop"").
Pertussis was a major cause of morbidity and mortality among infants and children in the United States during the prevaccine era (i.e., before the mid-1940s). Since pertussis became a nationally reportable disease in 1922, the highest number of pertussis cases (approximately 260,000) was reported in 1934; the highest number of pertussis related deaths (approximately 9,000) occurred in 1923. Following the licensure of and widespread use of whole-cell DTP among infants and children, the incidence of reported pertussis declined to a historical low of 1,010 cases in 1976. However, since the early 1980s, reported pertussis incidence has increased cyclically with each successive peak.
Acellular pertussis vaccines contain only those purified parts of the pertussis bacterium believed to be important in conferring immunity. Whole-cell vaccines, by contrast, incorporate entire, inactivated bacteria. Although whole-cell vaccines have been effective in reducing the incidence of pertussis, they are more likely to cause side effects, such as redness, pain and swelling at the site infection, fever, drowsiness, fretfulness and loss of appetite. A fear of side effects associated with whole-cell pertussis vaccines, and in some countries the lack of mandatory immunization, has led to an increase in the incidence of pertussis.
Beginning in the early 1980s, collaboration between scientists and vaccine manufacturers to improve pertussis vaccines led to the development of acellular vaccines. The first acellular vaccine was developed in Japan in the mid-seventies. In 1991, the Food and Drug Administration licensed an acellular vaccine to be used as booster doses at 15-18 months and 4-6 years of age. Now INFANRIX, the newest advance in DTP vaccines, has shown improved tolerability with significantly lower local and systemic reactions than whole-cell DTP vaccines.",
Erectile Dysfunction,Levitra (vardenafil),"General Information
Levitra (vardenafil), a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, is an oral medication for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). It helps increase blood flow to the penis and may help men with ED get and keep an erection satisfactory for sexual activity. PDE5 inhibitors are a widely accepted and efficacious therapeutic option for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men, as a result of extensive clinical experience with sildenafil and others.
It is available in 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg tablets no more than once a day.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Levitra was based on four multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, fixed-dose, parallel design trials. The studies enrolled a total of 2431 men with an average age of 57 years. The doses investigated were 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg. An efficacy assessment was based on the Erectile Function (EF) Domain score of the validated International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire and two questions from the Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) corresponding to vaginal penetration achievement (SEP2), and the ability to maintain an erection for intercourse (SEP3).
Results demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in the EF Domain, SEP2, and SEP3 scores compared to placebo. The mean baseline EF Domain score in these trials was 11.8.
In a major North American fixed dose trial, 762 subjects were evaluated. The mean baseline EF Domain scores were 13, 13, 13, 14 for the Levitra 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and placebo groups, respectively. There was significant improvement at three months with Levitra (EF Domain scores of 18, 21, 21, for the 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg dose groups, respectively) compared to the placebo group (EF Domain score of 15). The European trial of 803 subjects confirmed these results. In the North American trial, Levitra significantly improved the rates of achieving an erection sufficient for penetration (SEP2) at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg compared to placebo (65%, 75%, and 80%, respectively, compared to a 52% response in the placebo at 3 months. The European trial confirmed these results.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Levitra or erectile dysfunction, please contact The Levitra Information Site","Mechanism of Action
Levitra is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5).
Erection of the penis is initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum, one of a pair of sponge-like regions in the penis. When aroused, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP triggers smooth muscle relaxation, increasing blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection.

The FDA approval of Stendra was based on the results of 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trials. The trials enrolled subjects who self administered Stendra 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg 30 minutes prior to initiating sexual activity. Subjects could request an adjustment in treatment dosage based on individual response. The 3 primary outcome measures were the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and Questions 2 and 3 from Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP). Stendra demonstrated statistically significant improvement from baseline in all three dose arms against the placebo. A subset of patients from 2 of these trials were enrolled into an open-label extension trial to evaluate Stendra in ED patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus in a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled fixed dose trial of 3 months in duration. Stendra or placebo was administered in doses of 100 mg or 200 mg.

Stendra (avanafil) phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor. PDE5 is responsible for the degradation of cGMP, which produces smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allows inflow of blood. The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cGMP, producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Avanafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of NO by inhibiting PDE5. Because sexual stimulation is required to initiate the local release of nitric oxide, the inhibition of PDE5 has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.

Esophageal Cancer,Keytruda (pembrolizumab),"General Information
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking antibody.
Keytruda is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus whose tumors express PD-L1 [Combined Positive Score (CPS) â‰¥10] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression after one or more prior lines of systemic therapy.
Keytruda is supplied as an injection for intravenous administration. The recommended dose of Keytruda for esophageal cancer is 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Keytruda for esophageal cancer was based on the KEYNOTE-181 and KEYNOTE-180 clinical trials.
KEYNOTE-181 was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial that enrolled 628 patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 and who progressed on or after one prior line of systemic treatment for advanced disease. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either Keytruda 200 mg every three weeks or investigatorâ€™s choice of any of the following chemotherapy regimens, all given intravenously: paclitaxel 80-100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every four-week cycle, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, or irinotecan 180 mg/m2 every two weeks. Treatment with Keytruda or chemotherapy continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The trial met its primary endpoint of significantly improving overall survival (OS), with a 31% decrease in the risk of death compared to a chemotherapy regimen of paclitaxel, docetaxel or irinotecan.
KEYNOTE-180 was a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label trial that enrolled 121 patients with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer who progressed on or after at least two prior systemic treatments for advanced disease. With the exception of the number of prior lines of treatment, the eligibility criteria were similar to and the dosage regimen identical to KEYNOTE-181. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR). The ORR in the 35 patients with ESCC expressing PD-L1 (CPS â‰¥10) was 20%. Among the seven responding patients, the DoR ranged from 4.2 to 25.1+ months, with five patients (71%) having responses of six months or longer and three patients (57%) having responses of 12 months or longer.

Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD 1)-blocking, humanized monoclonal IgG4 kappa antibody. Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response.

Patients received placebo or Humira at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was time to treatment failure. Study UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15. Study UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19. Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in patients treated with Humira versus patients receiving placebo,(percentage in failure). Study UV I: Humira (54.5%) versus placebo (78.5%). Study UV II: Humira (39.1%) versus placebo (55%).

Eye Disorders/Infections,Moxidectin,"General Information
Moxidectin is a macrocyclic lactone anthelmintic medicine.
Moxidectin is specifically indicated for the treatment of onchocerciasis due to Onchocerca volvulus in patients aged 12 years and older.
Moxidectin is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dosage is a single dose of 8 mg (four 2 mg tablets) taken orally with or without food.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Moxidectin Tablets 8 mg in the treatment of onchocerciasis was based on data from two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials in patients with O. volvulus infection, Trial 1 in 1,472 patients and Trial 2, a dose-ranging trial. Patients in the trials received a single oral dose of moxidectin or ivermectin, the active control medication. Efficacy was assessed by skin microfilarial density (microfilariae/mg skin) from the mean of 4 skin snips per person per time point up to 18 months post-treatment.
Trial 1 recruited adult and adolescent patients â‰¥ 12 years with a body weight â‰¥ 30 kg and â‰¥ 10 microfilariae/mg skin. Mean (Â± SD) pretreatment skin microfilarial density was 39.5 (Â± 30.7), 69.6% had â‰¥ 20 microfilariae/mg skin and 39.7% had at least one ocular microfilaria. Patients who were not previously exposed to ivermectin community directed treatment programs were recruited from the sub-Saharan African region (Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, and Ghana). Moxidectin was statistically superior to ivermectin in mean skin microfilarial density and the proportion of patients with undetectable skin microfilariae at 1 month, 6 months and 12 months.
Safety and efficacy was assessed in the smaller single ascending dose trial 2, comparing 2 mg (n = 44), 4 mg (n = 45) (2 mg and 4 mg are not approved doses) and 8 mg (n = 38) single doses of moxidectin to ivermectin. Trial 2 was conducted in Ghana in adults aged â‰¥ 18 to â‰¤ 60 years with O. volvulus infection.

Moxidectin is a macrocyclic lactone anthelmintic medicine. The mechanism by which moxidectin exhibits its effect against Onchocerca volvulus (O. volvulus) is not known. Studies with other nematodes suggest that moxidectin binds to glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCl), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and/or ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. This leads to increased permeability, influx of chloride ions, hyperpolarization and muscle paralysis. Additionally, there is a reduction in motility of all stages of the parasite, excretion of immunomodulatory proteins, and the fertility of both male and female adult worms. Antimicrobial activity Moxidectin is active against the microfilariae of O. volvulus. Studies suggest that moxidectin is not effective in killing the adult worms, however, it inhibits intra-uterine embryogenesis and release of microfilariae from the adult worms.

Eye Disorders/Infections,Omidria (phenylephrine and ketorolac injection),"General Information
Omidria (phenylephrine and ketorolac injection) is a combination of an anti-inflammatory agent and a mydriatic agent (causes pupil dilation, called mydriasis).
Omidria is specifically indicated for use during cataract surgery or intraocular lens replacement for maintaining pupil size by preventing intraoperative miosis and reducing postoperative ocular pain.
Omidria is supplied as a solution for intraocular administration. For administration 4 mL of Omidria is diluted in 500 mL of ophthalmic irrigation solution. Irrigation solution is to be used as needed for the surgical procedure.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Omidria was based on three phase III randomized, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 808 adult subjects undergoing cataract surgery or intraocular lens replacement. Subjects were randomized to either Omidria or placebo. Subjects were treated with preoperative topical mydriatic and anesthetic agents. Pupil diameter was measured throughout the surgical procedure. Postoperative pain was evaluated by self-administered 0-100 mm visual analog scales (VAS). Mydriasis was maintained in the Omidria-treated groups while the placebo-treated groups experienced progressive constriction. At the end of cortical clean-up, 23% of placebo-treated subjects and 4% of Omidria-treated subjects had a pupil diameter less than 6 mm (p < 0.01). Pain during the initial 10-12 hours postoperatively was statistically significantly less in the Omidria-treated groups than in the placebo-treated groups. During the 10-12 hours postoperatively, 26% of Omidria-treated subjects reported no pain (VAS = 0 at all timepoints) while 17% of placebo-treated subjects reported no pain (p < 0.01).

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Omidria or intraoperative miosis and post-operative pain following eye surgery, please visit www.Omidria.com","Mechanism of Action
Omidria contains the active ingredienta phenylephrine and ketorolac. Phenylephrine is an a1-adrenergic receptor agonist and, in the eye, acts as a mydriatic agent by contracting the radial muscle of the iris. Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory that inhibits both cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), resulting in a decrease in tissue concentrations of prostaglandins to reduce pain due to surgical trauma. Ketorolac, by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis secondary to ocular surgical insult or direct mechanical stimulation of the iris, also prevents surgically induced miosis.

Eye Disorders/Infections,Xeomin (incobotulinumtoxinA),"General Information
Xeomin is a Clostridium botulinum type - A neurotoxin complex. Clostridium botulinum toxin type A is a bacterial toxin that prevents nerves from functioning normally (a neurotoxin). It prevents nerves from releasing a chemical called acetylcholine, which is essential for the nerves to communicate with muscle cells. This toxin therefore prevents muscles from receiving nerve stimulation. Botulinum toxin type A causes muscle paralysis until such time as the nerve develops new endings to communicate with the muscles. This it is useful for treating conditions where excessive nerve stimulation to muscles is causing abnormal muscle functioning or spasms.
Xeomin is specifically indicated for adults with cervical dystonia to decrease the severity of abnormal head position and neck pain in both botulinum toxin-naÃ¯ve and previously treated patients and for the treatment of adults with blepharospasm who were previously treated with onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox). Xeomin has also been approved as a first line treatment for blepharospasm and to treat chronic sialorrhea (excessive drooling) in adult patients.
Xeomin is supplied as a solution for intramuscular injection. The recommended initial doses are as follows:
cervical dystonia
120 Units usually injected into the sternocleidomastoid, levator scapulae, splenius capitis, scalenus, and/or the trapezius muscle(s). The dose and number of injection sites in each treated muscle should be individualized based on the number and location of the muscle(s) to be treated, the degree of spasticity/dystonia, muscle mass, body weight, and response to any previous botulinum toxin injections.
blepharospasm
The recommended initial total dose of Xeomin should be the same dose as the patientâ€™s previous treatment of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox). If the previous dose of Botox is not known, the initial dose of Xeomin should be between 1.25-2.5 Units/injection site. The total dose should not exceed 70 Units (35 Units/eye).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xeomin was based on the following studies:
cervical dystonia
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center phase III trial enrolled 233 patients with cervical dystonia. The baseline Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) total score â‰¥20, TWSTRS severity score â‰¥10, TWSTRS disability score â‰¥3, and TWSTRS pain score â‰¥1. The subjects received a single administration of Xeomin 240 Units (n=81), Xeomin 120 Units (n=78), or placebo (n=74). The investigator at each site decided which muscles would receive injections of Xeomin, the number of injection sites, and the volume at each site. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the TWSTRS total score from baseline to Week 4 post-injection. In the ITT population, the difference between the Xeomin 240 Unit group and the placebo group in the change of the TWSTRS total score from baseline to Week 4 was -9.0 points; the difference between the Xeomin 120 Unit group and the placebo group in the change of the TWSTRS total score from baseline to Week 4 was -7.5 points. Both results were statistically significant over placebo (p<0.001).
Blepharospasm
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center phase III trial enrolled 109 patients with blepharospasm. The baseline Jankovic Rating Scale (JRS) Severity subscore â‰¥2, and a stable satisfactory therapeutic response to previous administrations of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox). At least 10 weeks had to have elapsed since the most recent onabotulinumtoxinA administration. The subjects were randomized to receive a single administration of Xeomin or placebo. The Xeomin treatment (dose, volume, dilution, and injection sites per muscle) that was similar to the most recent onabotulinumtoxinA injection sessions prior to study entry. The highest dose permitted in this study was 50 Units per eye; the mean Xeomin dose was 33 Units per eye. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the JRS Severity subscore from baseline to Week 6 post-injection. The difference between the Xeomin arm and the placebo arm in the change of the JRS Severity subscore from baseline to Week 6 was -1.0 (p<0.001).

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Xeomin or cervical dystonias or blephorspasm, please visit the Merz web page.","Mechanism of Action
Xeomin blocks cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine from peripheral cholinergic nerve endings. This inhibition occurs according to the following sequence: neurotoxin binding to cholinergic nerve terminals, internalization of the neurotoxin into the nerve terminal, translocation of the light-chain part of the molecule into the cytosol of the nerve terminal, and enzymatic cleavage of SNAP25, a presynaptic target protein essential for the release of acetylcholine. Impulse transmission is re-established by the formation of new nerve endings.

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation
The recommended dose is 60 mg taken orally once daily Assess creatinine clearance, as calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, before initiating therapy with Savaysa. Do not use Savaysa in patients with CrCL > 95 mL/min due to an increased risk of ischemic stroke compared to warfarin. Reduce Savaysa dose to 30 mg once daily in patients with CrCL 15 to 50 mL/min.
Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
The recommended dose of Savaysa is 60 mg taken orally once daily following 5 to 10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant. The recommended dose of Savaysa is 30 mg once daily in patients with CrCL 15 to 50 mL/min, patients who weigh less than or equal to 60 kg, or patients who are taking certain concomitant P-gp inhibitor medications based on clinical study data in this indication.
For transition to Savaysa from other medications or from other medications to Savaysa, please see the drug label.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Savaysa was based on the following studies:
Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation
The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study was a multi-national, double-blind, non-inferiority study comparing the efficacy and safety of two Savaysa treatment arms (60 mg and 30 mg) to warfarin (titrated to INR 2.0 to 3.0) in reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolic events in patients with NVAF. A total of 21,105 patients were randomized and followed for a median of 2.8 years and treated for a median of 2.5 years. Patients in the Savaysa treatment arms had their dose halved (60 mg halved to 30 mg or 30 mg halved to 15 mg) if one or more of the following clinical factors were present: CrCL â‰¤ 50 mL/min, low body weight (â‰¤ 60 kg) or concomitant use of specific P-gp inhibitors (verapamil, quinidine, dronedarone). The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of first stroke (either ischemic or hemorrhagic) or of a systemic embolic event (SEE) that occurred during treatment or within 3 days from the last dose taken. Both treatment arms of SAVAYSA were non-inferior to warfarin for the primary efficacy endpoint of stroke or SEE. However, the 30 mg (15 mg dose-reduced) treatment arm was numerically less effective than warfarin for the primary endpoint, and was also markedly inferior in reducing the rate of ischemic stroke. Based on the planned superiority analysis (ITT, which required p < 0.01 for success), statistical superiority of the 60 mg (30 mg dose reduced) treatment arm compared to warfarin was not established in the total study population, but there was a favorable trend. Savaysa demonstrated significantly less major bleeding compared to warfarin.
Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
Hokusai VTE was a multinational, double-blind study which compared the efficacy and safety of Savaysa 60 mg orally once daily to warfarin (titrated to INR 2.0 3.0) in 8,292 patients with acute symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) (DVT or PE with or without DVT). The subjects were randomized to receive Savaysa or warfarin and were followed for a mean treatment duration of 252 days for Savaysa and 250 days for warfarin. In the trial, 3.2% of participants taking Savaysa had a symptomatic recurrent VTE compared to 3.5% of those taking warfarin.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Savaysa may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Dental and Oral Health,Atridox,"General Information
Atridox comprises doxycycline in the Atrigel delivery system, which is administered as a gel and solidifies in situ.",,,
Dental and Oral Health,Atridox,"General Information
ATRIDOX is indicated for use in the treatment of chronic adult periodontitis for a gain in clinical attachment, reduction in probing depth, and reduction in bleeding on probing.
The ATRIDOX product is a subgingival controlled-release product composed of a two syringe mixing system. Syringe A contains 450 mg of the ATRIGELÂ® Delivery System, which is a bioabsorbable, flowable polymeric formulation composed of 36.7% poly(DL-lactide) (PLA) dissolved in 63.3% N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Syringe B contains doxycycline hyclate which is equivalent to 42.5 mg doxycycline. The constituted product is a pale yellow to yellow viscous liquid with a concentration of 8.5% w/w of doxycycline.
Clinical Results
In two well-controlled, multicenter, parallel-design, nine-month clinical trials, 831 patients (Study 1=411; Study 2=420) with chronic adult periodontitis characterized by a mean probing depth of 5.9 to 6.0 mm were enrolled. Subjects received one of four treatments:
ATRIDOX
Scaling and Root Planing
Vehicle Control
Oral Hygiene
Treatment was administered to sites with probing depths 5 mm or greater that bled on probing. Subjects with detectable subgingival calculus on greater than 80% of all tooth surfaces were excluded from enrollment. All subjects received a second administration of the initially randomized treatment four months after their baseline treatment. Changes in the efficacy parameters, attachment level, pocket depth, and bleeding on probing, between baseline and month 9 showed that:
ATRIDOX was superior to Vehicle Control and Oral Hygiene
ATRIDOX met the decision rule of being at least 75% as good as Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) (the standard of at least 75% as good as SRP is required for any product approved as a stand alone therapy for periodontitis).
A single-center, single-blind, randomized, clinical study in 45 subjects with periodontal disease demonstrated that a single treatment with ATRIDOX resulted in the reduction in the numbers of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, C. rectus, F. nucleatum, Bacteroides forsythus, and E. corrodens in subgingival plaque samples. Levels of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were also reduced after treatment with ATRIDOX. The clinical significance of these findings, however, is not known. During these studies, no overgrowth of opportunistic organisms such as Gram-negative bacilli and yeast were observed. However, as with other antibiotic preparations, ATRIDOX therapy may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi.
Clinicians should note that the studies were of nine months duration. Additional research would be necessary to establish long term comparability to SRP.
","Side Effects
ATRIDOX should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to doxycycline or any other drug in the tetracycline class.
In clinical trials involving a total of 1436 patients, adverse experiences were monitored across treatment groups.
In the Circulatory System category, 10 subjects (1.6%) in the ATRIDOX group were reported as having unspecified essential hypertension. Only 1 subject (0.2%) in the Vehicle group, and none in the Scaling and Root Planing or Oral Hygiene groups were reported to have unspecified essential hypertension. In all cases, the event occurred anywhere from 13 to 134 days post-treatment.
There is no known association of oral administration of doxycycline with essential hypertension.
Two patients in the polymer vehicle group and none in the ATRIDOX group (0.2% for both groups combined) reported adverse events consistent with a localized allergic response.
Sex, age, race and smoking status did not appear to be correlated with adverse events.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum semisynthetic tetracycyline.1 Doxycycline is bacteriostatic, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis due to disruption of transfer RNA and messenger RNA at ribosomal sites.

Dental and Oral Health,Myobloc (rimabotulinumtoxinB),"General Information
Myobloc (rimabotulinumtoxinB) is an acetylcholine release inhibitor.
Myobloc is specifically indicated for the treatment of chronic sialorrhea in adults.
Myobloc is supplied as an injection for intra-salivary gland administration. The recommended dose for chronic sialorrhea is 1,500 Units to 3,500 Units, divided among the parotid and submandibular glands, per the directions below. Patient response to treatment should be considered when determining subsequent Myobloc dosage. The typical duration of effect of each treatment is up to 3 months; however, the effect may vary in individual patients. The frequency of Myobloc repeat treatments should be determined by clinical response but should generally be no more frequent than every 12 weeks.
Dosing by Gland for Chronic Sialorrhea in Adults:
â€¢ Gland: Parotid Recommended dose: 500 Units to 1,500 Units per gland
â€¢ Gland: Submandibular Recommended dose: 250 Units per gland
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Myobloc for chronic sialorrhea was based on a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a single treatment (with 13-week follow-up), followed by an open-label treatment period. A total of 187 adult patients with chronic, troublesome sialorrhea for at least 3 months were randomized to receive treatment with Myobloc 2,500 Units, 3,500 Units, or placebo. Patients had chronic sialorrhea associated with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (n=122), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) (n=12), stroke (n=13), and other causes (n=40). Patients with a history of aspiration or severe dysphagia in the last 6 months and ALS patients with a forced vital capacity of less than 20% of predicted were excluded from the study. A single treatment was administered, consisting of bilateral injections of Myobloc into the parotid (1,000 Units or 1,500 Units per gland) and submandibular (250 Units per gland) salivary glands or volume matched placebo. A total of 114 patients received 4 consecutive treatments with 3,500 Units of Myobloc every 11 to 15 weeks. The co-primary efficacy endpoints for Study 1 were the change from baseline in Unstimulated Salivary Flow Rate (USFR) and the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) assessed 4 weeks after treatment in the double-blind part of the study. The CGI-C is a seven-point Likert scale with scores ranging from â€œ1=very much improvedâ€� to â€œ7=very much worseâ€�. The change from baseline (i.e., decrease) in USFR at Week 4 was significantly greater for patients treated with Myobloc than in patients on placebo. Similarly, CGI-C scores at Week 4 were significantly lower (i.e., better) in patients treated with Myobloc than in patients on placebo. Chronic sialorrhea was â€˜much improvedâ€™ or â€˜very much improvedâ€™, according to CGI-C scores at Week 4 post injection, in patients treated with Myobloc 2,500 Units (60%) and Myobloc 3,500 Units (53%) than in patients on placebo (12%).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Myobloc may include, but are not limited to, dry mouth and dysphagia.
The Myobloc drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning: The effects of Myobloc and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults, particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Myobloc or chronic sialorrhea in adults, please visit the Myobloc web page.","Mechanism of Action
Myobloc (rimabotulinumtoxinB) is an acetylcholine release inhibitor. Myobloc blocks cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular and salivary neuroglandular junction by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine from peripheral cholinergic nerved terminals. This inhibition occurs according to the following sequence: neurotoxin binding to cholinergic nerve terminals, internalization of the neurotoxin into the nerve terminal, translocation of the light-chain part of the molecule into the cytosol of the nerve terminal, and enzymatic cleavage of synaptic Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein (VAMP, also known as synaptobrevin), a presynaptic target protein essential for the release of acetylcholine. In both muscles and glands, impulse transmission is re-established by the formation of new nerve endings.

Dental and Oral Health,Periostat (doxycycline hyclate),"General Information
Periostat is a twice daily, orally administered tablet that has been approved as an adjunctive treatment to scaling and root planing (SRP), a deep cleaning of the teeth and gums. This drug promotes attachment level gain and reduces pocket depth in patients with adult periodontitis. The capsule formulation of Periostat was approved for use in September 1998.
Periodontitis is the most serious of the periodontal diseases, commonly referred to as gum diseases. It is remarkably common in adults over the age of 35, with some sources estimating that up to one third of American adults suffer from some form of periodontitis. The etiology of periodontitis is multifactorial. Its nature and severity are determined by complex interactions between infectious bacteria and a susceptible host. The end results of this interaction are the bone and soft tissue destruction and attachment loss that characterize periodontitis.
Current first-line therapies for periodontitis, such as SRP, primarily address the bacterial component of the disease. If indicated, SRP may be supplemented by antimicrobial drugs. Periostat is the first and only drug designed to reduce the activity of the enzymes that destroy tooth and gum tissue. When prescribed as an adjunct to SRP, it has been shown to help slow the progression of adult periodontitis more effectively than SRP alone.
Clinical Results
The efficacy of Periostat (doxycycline hyclate) as an adjunctive treatment for adult periodontitis was established in a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, nine month phase III study involving 190 subjects with periodontal disease. The effects of oral administration of twice daily Periostat tablets in combination with SRP procedures were compared to placebo plus SRP.
Results were based on measurements of pocket depth, attachment level, and bleeding-on-probing. Such measurements were obtained from the treated areas directly after SRP, after three months, six months, and nine months. Periostat administered with SRP improved clinical attachment level by up to 52 percent and reduced pocket depth by as much as 67 percent compared to SRP plus placebo. These benefits were observed as early as three months into the study and were maintained over the nine month period of the trial.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of doxycycline hyclate may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Diarrhea
Heartburn
Joint pain
Nausea
","Additional Information
For additional information on Periostat, please visit Periostat or www.galdermausa.com.","Mechanism of Action
Periostat (doxycycline hyclate) is an oral enzyme inhibitor that works by reducing the activity of host-derived enzymes, such as collagenase. Collagenase has been shown to be associated with the destruction of the periodontal support structures during the progression of adult periodontitis. Periostat is administered systemically, offering the additional advantage of being able to treat all the tooth sites simultaneously, a whole-mouth approach to the management of the host response.

Depression,Brintellix (vortioxetine),"General Information
Brintellix (vortioxetine) is a serotonin modulator and stimulator. It belongs to a psychotropic class of chemical compunds known as bis-aryl-sulphanyl amines.
Brintellix is specifically indicated for Major Depressive Disorder.
Brintellix is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended starting dose is 10 mg administered orally once daily without regard to meals. The dose should then be increased to 20 mg/day, as tolerated.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Brintellix was based on six 6 to 8 week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies (including one study in the elderly) and one maintenance study in adult inpatients and outpatients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for MDD.
Adults (aged 18 years to 75 years)
The efficacy of Brintellix in subjects aged 18 years to 75 years was demonstrated in five 6 to 8 week, placebo-controlled studies. In these studies, subjects were randomized to Brintellix 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg or 20 mg or placebo once daily. For subjects who were randomized to Brintellix 15 mg/day or 20 mg/day, the final doses were titrated up from 10 mg/day after the first week. The primary efficacy measures were the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-24) total score in Study 2 and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score in all other studies. In each of these studies, at least one dose group of Brintellix was superior to placebo in improvement of depressive symptoms as measured by mean change from baseline to endpoint visit on the primary efficacy measurement.
Elderly
The efficacy of Brintellix for the treatment of MDD was also demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study of Brintellix in elderly subjects (aged 64 years to 88 years) with MDD. Subjects received Brintellix 5 mg or placebo. The primary endpoints were also reached in this population.
Maintenance Study
In a non-US maintenance study 639 subjects meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD received flexible doses of Brintellix (5 mg or 10 mg) once daily during an initial 12 week open-label treatment phase; the dose of Brintellix was fixed during Weeks 8 to 12. Three hundred ninety six (396) patients who were in remission (MADRS total score =10 at both Weeks 10 and 12) after open-label treatment were randomly assigned to continuation of a fixed dose of Brintellix at the final dose they responded to (about 75% of patients were on 10 mg/day) during the open-label phase or to placebo for 24 to 64 weeks. Approximately 61% of randomized patients satisfied remission criterion (MADRS total score =10) for at least 4 weeks (since Week 8), and 15% for at least 8 weeks (since Week 4). Patients on Brintellix experienced a statistically significantly longer time to have recurrence of depressive episodes than did patients on placebo.

Lithobid slow-release tablets in a 300mg dosage have been approved for the treatment of manic depression. Lithobid provides twice-daily dosing as opposed to several times a day for immediate-release preparations; Lithobid's slow-release formulation helps to minimize variations in lithium concentrations as compared with immediate-release preparations.
Clinical Results
A recent study showed that within three weeks of vigorous lithium treatment, 49% of the subjects had a moderate or better response.
",,"Additional Information
The lifetime risk of manic depression is 1.2%, with an annual incidence of 9-15 new cases per 100,000 per year for men, and seven to 30 new cases per 100,000 per year for women. Studies have shown that an estimated 20 % of all cases of major mood disorders result from manic depression.
Manic episodes are distinct periods in which one's mood changes from its normal state to an abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. The associated symptoms include inflated self-esteem or grandiosity, feeling of elation, euphoria, decreased need for sleep, pressure of speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, aggressiveness, and possible hostility.
Lithium has been used to treat manic depression for more than 20 years and is most likely to be effective in subjects with pure manic symptomatology (elation and grandiosity). Response rates in these subjects may be as high as 90%.",

Approval of Paxil CR is supported by results from two placebo-controlled studies with subjects diagnosed with major depressive disorder and three flexible-dose studies with subjects with panic disorder. Paxil CR was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in all studies except the third study for treatment of panic disorder.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Paxil CR may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Abnormal ejaculation
Abnormal vision
Constipation
Somnolence
Decreased libido
Sweating
Female genital disorders
","Additional Information

Depression,Prozac Weekly (fluoxetine HCl),"General Information
Prozac Weekly (fluoxetine hydrochloride) has been approved by the FDA for the continuation treatment phase of major depressive disorder. The drug is administered on a weekly basis, and it is indicated for patients whose depressive symptoms have stabilized and who require continuing treatment to prevent a relapse, or return of symptoms.
Prozac Weekly contains 90 mg of fluoxetine with an enteric coating that delays release into the bloodstream. Fluoxetine is known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor - it is believed to provide a therapeutic effect by blocking neuronal (nerve cell) uptake of serotonin, resulting in increased levels of the hormone.
Major depressive disorders, which include depression, affect an estimated 340 million people worldwide. If left untreated, the effects of depression can be devastating, robbing people of the energy or motivation to perform everyday activities and, in some cases, leading to suicide. Symptoms of the disorder include feelings of sadness or emptiness, lack of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities, and feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt.
Clinical Results
In clinical trials, researchers examined 501 depressed subjects who responded well to 13 weeks of therapy with fluoxetine 20 mg. These subjects were then randomly assigned to treatment with a 90 mg enteric-coated formulation of fluoxetine taken once weekly, fluoxetine at 20 mg daily or a placebo for a 25-week, double-blind period.
Rates of relapse for subjects treated either with the enteric coated or 20 mg formulation of fluoxetine were significantly lower than for those treated with placebo. Additionally, subjects treated with either 90 mg or 20 mg fluoxetine rated significantly better on depression rating scales when compared with subjects assigned to placebo.
","Side Effects
The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of fluoxetine in Untied States controlled trials for depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and bulimia combined were the following:
Nausea
Headache
Insomnia
Anxiety
Nervousness
Somnolence (sleepiness)
","Additional Information
Please visit Eli Lilly and Company for more information on Prozac Weekly.
If you would like further information on depression, please visit the National Institute of Mental Health.","Mechanism of Action
The antidepressant, antiobsessive-compulsive, and antibulemic actions of fluoxetine are presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin. Studies at clinically relevant doses in man have demonstrated that fluoxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. Studies in animals suggest that fluoxetine is a much more potent uptake inhibitor of serotonin than of norepinephrine.
Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and a1-adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects of classic tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drugs. Fluoxetine binds to these and other membrane receptors from brain tissue much less potently in vitro than do the tricyclic drugs. (from Prozac Prescribing Information).

Depression,Remeron (Mirtazapine),"General Information
Remeron has been approved for the treatment of depression.
Clinical Results
The FDA clearance of Remeron is based on efficacy data from clinical trials involving approximately 3,000 people. Results from placebo and amitriptyline-controlled clinical trials supported the conclusion that Remeron provides effective relief of depression.
","Side Effects
Side effects observed in clinical trials were mostly mild and generally have not caused subjects to stop taking Remeron. The commonly reported drug-related side effects in subjects taking Remeron were somnolence, increased appetite, weight gain, and dizziness.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Remeron is the first agent in a new class of anti-depressants. Remeron stimulates norepinephrine and serotonin release while also blocking two serotonin receptors (5-HT2 and 5-HT3)."
Depression,Remeron SolTab (mirtazapine),"General Information
Remeron SolTab is an orally disintegrating tablet that has been approved for the treatment of depression. Unlike other antidepressant tablets, which must be swallowed whole, Remeron SolTab dissolves on the tongue within 30 seconds. This easy delivery method may enhance patient compliance as the tablet can be swallowed with or without water, chewed or allowed to disintegrate.
Along with its unique delivery system, Remeron SolTab has a novel pharmacological profile that increases the levels of both norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain to effectively fight depression. This is in contrast to many antidepressants, which only increase serotonin. According to the company, the product is suitable for depressed patients of all ages.
According to the National Mental Health Association, clinical depression is one of the most common mental illnesses, affecting more than 19 million Americans each year. Unfortunately, fewer than half of those suffering from depression get the treatment they need -- and others stop treatment too soon.
Organon is the United States human healthcare business of Akzo Nobel. Organon and Solvay Pharmaceuticals have contracted to co-promote Remeron SolTab.
Clinical Results
Remeron SolTab is an orally disintegrating tablet version of Remeron (mirtazapine) Tablets. The effectiveness of Remeron Tablets as a treatment for depression was established in four placebo-controlled, 6-week trials in adult outpatients. Patients received mirtazapine from a dose range of 5 mg up to 35 mg per day.
Overall, these studies demonstrated mirtazapine to be superior to placebo on at least three of the following four measures: 21-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total score; HDRS Depressed Mood Item; CGI Severity score; and Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Mirtazapine was also shown to be superior to placebo for certain factors of the HDRS, such as anxiety/somatization and sleep disturbance. The mean mirtazapine dose for subjects who completed these four studies ranged from 21 to 32 mg per day. A fifth study of similar design utilized a higher dose (up to 50 mg) per day, which also showed effectiveness. (from Remeron Prescribing Information)
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of mirtazapine may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Somnolence (sleepiness)
Dry mouth
Increased appetite
Weight gain
Dizziness
","Additional Information
For additional information on Remeron SolTab, please visit Organon.","Mechanism of Action
The mechanism of action of Remeron (mirtazapine) Tablets, as with other antidepressants, is unknown. Mirtazapine has a tetracyclic chemical structure unrelated to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI). It belongs to the piperazino-azepine group of compounds.
According to preclinical studies, mirtazapine enhances central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. These studies have shown that mirtazapine acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic a2 adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, which may contribute to the increase in central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity.

Periodically reassess to determine the continued need and appropriate dosage for treatment.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Adjunctive treatment for Major Depressive Disorder:
The efficacy of Rexulti in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) was evaluated in two 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials of adults meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD, with or without symptoms of anxiety, who had an inadequate response to prior antidepressant therapy (1 to 3 courses) in the current episode and who had also demonstrated an inadequate response throughout the 8 weeks of prospective antidepressant treatment. In Study 228 (Study 1) subjects were randomized to Rexulti 2 mg once a day or placebo. In Study 227 (Study 2) subjects were randomized to Rexulti 1 or 3 mg once a day or placebo. For subjects randomized to Rexulti, all subjects initiated treatment at 0.5 mg once daily during Week 1. At Week 2, the Rexulti dosage was increased to 1 mg in all treatment groups, and either maintained at 1 mg or increased to 2 mg or 3 mg once daily, based on treatment assignment, from Week 3 onwards. The dosages were then maintained for the 4 remaining weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to Week 6 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10-item clinician-related scale used to assess the degree of depressive symptomatology, with 0 representing no symptoms, and 60 representing worst symptoms. At randomization, the mean MADRS total score was 27. In both studies adjunctive brexpiprazole showed greater improvement than adjunctive placebo in MADRS total score at Week 6 in the efficacy population per final protocol in Study 1 (2mg+ADT [N=175]: -3.21, p=0.0002), and in Study 2 (1mg+ADT [N=211]: -1.30, p=0.0737; 3mg+ADT [N=213]: -1.95, p=0.0079). Similar results were observed for the efficacy population in both studies. The completion rate was high (>90%) and comparable across brexpiprazole and placebo groups.
Schizophrenia:
The efficacy of Rexulti in the treatment of adults with schizophrenia was demonstrated in two 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical trials in subjects who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia. In both studies, Study 231 (Study 3) and Study 230 (Study 4), subjects were randomized to Rexulti 2 or 4 mg once per day or placebo. Subjects in the Rexulti groups initiated treatment at 1 mg once daily on Days 1 to 4. The Rexulti dosage was increased to 2 mg on Days 5 to 7. The dosage was then either maintained at 2 mg once daily or increased to 4 mg once daily, depending on treatment assignment, for the 5 remaining weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint of both trials was the change from baseline to Week 6 in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score. In one study, brexpiprazole 4mg and 2mg demonstrated greater improvement than placebo in the primary endpoint of change from baseline to Week 6 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score (4mg: -19.65, p=0.0006 and 2mg: -20.73, p=<0.0001 vs. placebo -12.01; 0.25mg was similar to placebo -14.90). In the other study, brexpiprazole 4mg showed improvement over placebo in the primary endpoint of PANSS Total Score from baseline to Week 6 (-20.0 vs. -13.5, p=0.0022), while the 2mg (-16.6) and 1mg (-16.9) doses showed numeric improvement versus placebo (-13.5, p>0.05).

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Spravato was based on three short-term (four-week) clinical trials and one longer-term maintenance-of-effect trial. In the three short-term studies, patients were randomized to receive Spravato or a placebo nasal spray. All patients in these studies started a new oral antidepressant at the time of randomization and the new antidepressant was continued throughout the trials. The primary efficacy measure was the change from baseline on a scale used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. In one of the short-term studies, Spravato nasal spray demonstrated statistically significant effect compared to placebo on the severity of depression, and some effect was seen within two days. The two other short-term trials did not meet the pre-specified statistical tests for demonstrating effectiveness. In the longer-term maintenance-of-effect trial, patients in stable remission or with stable response who continued treatment with Spravato plus an oral antidepressant experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse of depressive symptoms than patients on placebo nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant.

Dupixent is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous administration. The recommended dose of Dupixent for adults is an initial dose of 600 mg (two 300 mg injections), followed by 300 mg given every other week. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be used, but should be reserved for problem areas only, such as the face, neck, intertriginous and genital areas. If a dose is missed, the injection should be administered within 7 days from the missed dose and then the original schedule should be resumed. If the missed dose is not administered within 7 days, the patient should wait until the next dose on the original schedule.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Dupixent was based on three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials which enrolled subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) not adequately controlled by topical medication(s). Disease severity was defined by an Investigatorâ€™s Global Assessment (IGA) score â‰¥3 in the overall assessment of AD lesions on a severity scale of 0 to 4, an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score â‰¥16 on a scale of 0 to 72, and a minimum body surface area involvement of â‰¥10%. All three trials assessed the primary endpoint, the change from baseline to Week 16 in the proportion of subjects with an IGA 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and at least a 2-point improvement.
LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 enrolled 1,379 adults with moderate-to-severe AD in the identically-designed trials. Subjects were randomized into one of three treatment groups: dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneously once per week, dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneously every two weeks, or placebo for 16 weeks following an initial dupilumab loading dose of 600 mg subcutaneously, or placebo. Both trials met the primary endpoints. For SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, respectively, 37 and 36% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg weekly, and 38 and 36% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg every two weeks, achieved clearing or near-clearing of skin lesions (IGA 0 or 1), compared to 10 and 8.5% with placebo (p less than 0.0001).
LIBERTY AD CHRONOS enrolled 700 adults with moderate-to-severe AD. The trial was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab when administered concomitantly with topical corticosteroids through 16 weeks. Secondary objectives of the study included the long-term safety and efficacy of dupilumab up to 52 weeks. The primary endpoints at week 16 were reached: 39% of patients who received either dupilumab 300 mg weekly with TCS or dupilumab 300 mg every two weeks with TCS achieved clearing or near-clearing of skin lesions (IGA 0 or 1), compared to 12% of patients receiving placebo with TCS (p less than 0.0001). 64% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg weekly with TCS, and 69% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg every two weeks with TCS achieved EASI-75, a 75 percent reduction on an index measuring eczema severity, compared to 23% of patients receiving placebo with TCS (p less than 0.0001). The secondary endpoint 52-week results were also reached and showed the following: 40% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg weekly with TCS, and 36% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg every two weeks with TCS achieved clearing or near-clearing of skin lesions (IGA 0 or 1), compared to 12.5% of patients receiving placebo with TCS (p less than 0.0001). 64% of patients who received 300 mg weekly with TCS, and 65% of patients who received 300 mg every two weeks with TCS achieved EASI-75, compared to 22% with placebo with TCS (p less than 0.0001).

Dermatology,Altabax (retapamulin),"General Information
Altabax is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor belonging to a class of compounds called pleuromutilins. These compounds act by inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis at the level of bacterial 50S ribosome.
Altabax is specifically indicated for use in adults and pediatric patients aged 9 months and older for the topical treatment of impetigo (up to 100 cm2 in total area in adults or 2% total body surface area in pediatric patients aged 9 months or older) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) or Streptococcus pyogenes.
Altabax is supplied as a gel in 5, 10, and 15 gram tubes for topical administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is a thin layer over the infected area up to 100 cm2 in total area in adults or 2% total body surface area in pediatric patients aged 9 months or older) twice daily for 5 days.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Altabax was based on the results of a double-blind, randomized, multi-center, parallel group, comparison trial. This study enrolled 210 adult and pediatric subjects, aged 9 months of age and older, with impetigo up to 100 cm2 in total area (up to 10 lesions) or a total body surface area not exceeding 2%. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive Altabax or placebo for five days. Success was defined as the absence of treated lesions, or treated lesions had become dry without crusts with or without erythema compared to baseline, or had improved (defined as a decline in the size of the affected area, number of lesions or both) such that no further antimicrobial therapy was required. The intent-to-treat clinical (ITTC) population consisted of all randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of Altabax. The clinical per protocol (PPC) population included all ITTC patients who satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria and subsequently adhered to the protocol. The intent-to-treat bacteriological (ITTB) population consisted of all randomized patients who took at least one dose of study medication and had a pathogen identified at study entry. The bacteriological per protocol (PPB) population included all ITTB patients who satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria and subsequently adhered to the protocol. At the end of therapy, two days after treatment , the success rates in the Altabax group were as follows: PPC (89.5%), ITTC (85.6%), PPB (89.7%), ITTB (88.6%) versus 53.2%, 52.1%, 50.0% and 49.1%, respectively, for placebo. At the treatment follow-up (9 days after therapy) success rates were as follows: PPC (82.4%), ITTC (75.5%), PPB (84.3%) and ITTB (79.8%) versus 43.1%, 39.4%, 37.5% and 33.3%, respectively, for placebo.

Altabax is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor belonging to a class of compounds called pleuromutilins. These compounds act by inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis at the level of bacterial 50S ribosome. This binding site involves ribosomal protein L3 and is in the region of the ribosomal P site and peptidyl transferase center. By virtue of binding to this site, pleuromutilins inhibit peptidyl transfer, block P-site interactions, and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.

Dermatology,Ameluz (aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride),"General Information
Ameluz (aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride) is a porphyrin precursor.
Ameluz is specifically indicated in combination with photodynamic therapy (PDT) using BF-RhodoLED lamp, a narrowband, red light illumination source, for lesion-directed and field-directed treatment of actinic keratoses (AKs) of mild-to-moderate severity on the face and scalp.
Ameluz is supplied as a gel for topical administration. Treat single lesions or an entire field affected by multiple lesions with Ameluz, in combination with red light photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT requires administration of both Ameluz and BF-RhodoLED light. Retreat lesions that have not completely resolved after 3 months after the initial treatment. Refer to BF-RhodoLED user manual for detailed lamp safety and operating instructions.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ameluz in combination with PDT using a narrow spectrum (red light lamp) source was based on three randomized, multicenter trials (Trials 1, 2, and 3). Trials 2 and 3 were vehicle-controlled and double-blind. Trial 1 was double-blind with respect to vehicle and observer-blind regarding the active comparator arm. All clinical trials included a follow-up assessment after 6 and 12 months. In these trials, 212 subjects with 4 to 8 mild to moderate AK lesions on the face/forehead and/or bald scalp were treated with Ameluz and a narrow band spectrum lamp. In all trials, the lesions that were not completely cleared 12 weeks after the initial treatment were treated a second time with an identical regimen. In the trials, 42% (88/212) of subjects needed a second treatment. The primary endpoint for all trials was complete clearance 12 weeks after the last PDT. Trial 1: 85% versus 13% for placebo; Trial 2: 84% versus 3% and Trial 3: 91% versus 22% for placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Ameluz may include, but are not limited to, the following:
erythema
pain/burning
irritation
edema
pruritus
exfoliation
scab
induration
vesicles
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Ameluz or actinic keratoses, please visit http://biofrontera.com/","Mechanism of Action
Ameluz (aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride) is a porphyrin precursor. Photoactivation following topical application of Ameluz occurs when aminolevulinic acid (prodrug) is metabolized to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a photoactive compound which accumulates in the skin. When exposed to red light of a suitable wavelength and energy, PpIX is activated resulting in an excited state of porphyrin molecules. In the presence of oxygen, reactive oxygen species are formed which causes damage to cellular components, and eventually destroys the cells. Ameluz photodynamic therapy of AK lesions utilizes photoactivation of topically applied Ameluz resulting from BF-RhodoLED illumination, which provides a red light of narrow spectrum and a light dose of approximately 37 J/cm2.

Dermatology,Amevive (alefacept),"General Information
Amevive (alefacept) is an immunosuppressive dimeric fusion protein that reduces lymphocyte counts (T-cells) thus treating the cause of psoriasis. It is indicated in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy
Amevive is available in either intramuscular injection (15-mg alefacept) or intravenous injection (7.5-mg alefacept) formulations.
Amevive reduces immune cell counts which could increase the chance of developing infection or malignancy.
Clinical Results
Amevive was evaluated in two randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled studies in 726 adult subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis. In both trials, Amevive or placebo was administered once a week for 12 weeks. In total 77% of subjects had previously received systemic therapy and/or phototherapy for psoriasis.
Response to treatment in both studies was defined as the proportion of subjects with a reduction in score on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)Â³ of at least 75% from baseline at two weeks following the 12-week treatment period. Other treatment responses included the proportion of subjects who achieved a scoring of 'almost clear' or 'clear' by Physician Global Assessment (PGA) and the proportion of subjects with a reduction in PASI of at least 50% from baseline two weeks after the 12-week treatment period.
In both studies, onset of response to Amevive treatment (at least a 50% reduction of baseline PASI) began 60 days after the start of therapy. In Study 1, the median duration of response (75% or greater reduction in PASI) was 3.5 months for Amevive treated patients and 1 month for placebo-treated patients. In Study 2, the median duration of response was approximately 2 months for both groups. A majority of the subjects had responded to either Amevive or placebo maintained a 50% or greater reduction in PASI through the 3-month observation period. In both studies, an additional 11% (42/367) and 7% (12/166) of subjects treated with Amevive, respectively, achieved a 75% reduction from baseline PASI score at one or more visits after the first 2 weeks of the follow-up period.

Sore throat
Dizziness
Cough
Nausea
Itching

Injection Site Pain
Injection Site Inflammation
Accidental injury
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Amevive or psoriasis, please contact The Amevive Information Site","Mechanism of Action
Amevive (alefacept) is an immunosuppressive dimeric fusion protein that consists of the extracellular CD2-binding portion of the human leukocyte function antigen-3 (LFA-3) linked to the Fc (hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains) portion of human IgG1. Alefacept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) mammalian cell expression system.
Amevive interferes with lymphocyte activation by specifically binding to the lymphocyte antigen, CD2, and inhibiting LFA-3/CD2 interaction. Activation of T lymphocytes involving the interaction between LFA-3 on antigen-presenting cells and CD2 on T lymphocytes plays a role in the pathophysiology of chronic plaque psoriasis. The majority of T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions are of the memory effector phenotype characterized by the presence of the CD45RO markerÂ¹, express activation markers (e.g., CD25, CD69) and release inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon y.
Amevive also causes a reduction in subsets of CD2+ T lymphocytes (primarily CD45RO+), presumably by bridging between CD2 on target lymphocytes and immunoglobulin Fc receptors on cytotoxic cells, such as natural killer cells. Treatment with Amevive results in a reduction in circulating total CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts. CD2 is also expressed at low levels on the surface of natural killer cells and certain bone marrow B-lymphocytes.

Bavencio (avelumab) is a programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody. PD-L1 may be expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells and can contribute to the inhibition of the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors found on T cells and antigen presenting cells suppresses cytotoxic T-cell activity, T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Avelumab binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors PD-1 and B7.1. This interaction releases the inhibitory effects of PD-L1 on the immune response resulting in the restoration of immune responses, including anti-tumor immune responses.

Dermatology,Benzamycin (erythromycin 3%-benzoyl peroxide 5% topical gel),"General Information
Benzamycin is a combination of two active ingredients, benzoyl peroxide and erythromycin, which has proven effective in stopping acne-causing bacteria and reducing acne infection. Erythromycin is an antibiotic produced from a strain of Saccharopolyspora erythraea, whereas benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial and keratolytic agent (causes the break down of keratin).
The term ""acne vulgaris"" refers to the more common form of acne, consisting of non-inflammatory and mildly inflammatory lesions. The more severe form of acne is characterized by the presence of nodules. Nearly 17 million people in the United States have acne, making it the most common skin disease. Although acne is not a serious health threat, severe acne can lead to disfiguring, permanent scarring, which can be upsetting for people who suffer from the disorder.
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions reported occasionally or associated with the use of Benzamycin Topical Gel include the following:
Dryness
Urticarial reaction (hives, itching)
Peeling
Burning sensation
Inflammation of the face, eyes, and nose
Skin discoloration
Oiliness
Tenderness of the skin
","Additional Information
For additional information on Benzamycin, please visit the web site of Dermik Laboratories.","Mechanism of Action
Erythromycin inhibits protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by reversibly binding to 50 S ribosomal subunits, thereby inhibiting translocation of aminoacyl transfer-RNA and inhibiting polypeptide synthesis. Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between erythromycin, lincomycin, chloramphenicol, and clindamycin.
The exact mechanism by which erythromcyin reduces lesions of acne vulgaris is not fully known; however, the effect appears to be due in part to the antibacterial activity of the drug.
Benzoyl peroxide has a keratolytic and desquamative effect which may also contribute to its efficacy. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid. (from Benzamycin Prescribing Information, www.dermik.com)

Dermatology,Botox Cosmetic (botulinum toxin type A),"General Information
Botox Cosmetic was approved by the FDA in April 2002 for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines (brow furrow) in adult men and women, ages 65 and younger. Botox cosmetic is administered in several injections of purified protein directly into the effected area. The drug works by blocking nerve impulses to relax the contraction of the two major forehead muscles. These contractions are the cause vertical wrinkles between the eyebrows. Following treatment with Botox Cosmetic, improved appearance can be seen as early as one to two days, and the effects can last up to four months.
Botox was previously approved by the FDA for the treatment of several neurological disorders, including strabismus (crossed eyes), blepharospasm (uncontrollable blinking), and head position and neck pain associated with cervical dystonia (a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions).
Clinical Results
Botox Cosmetic was tested in a 12-month study consisting of two periods. The first period was a four-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 537 patients with glabellar lines to evaluate efficacy of the drug. At day 30 following treatment, investigators' assessment of the improvement indicated that 80.2% of subjects treated with Botox Cosmetic showed significant reduction in severity of glabellar lines, compared to 3.0% of subjects treated with placebo showing improvement. Patients self-assessment yielded similar results.
The second treatment period was an 8-month, open-label period evaluating the safety of repeated treatments with the drug. 373 subjects from the first period continued into the second period. Of these subjects, 2.1% reported blepharoptosis (droopy eyelid) following the first treatment, and 1.2% reported this effect after a second treatment. 49% of subjects reported side effects of any type.

","Additional Information
For more information about Botox Cosmetic, please visit the product web site at www.botox.com.","Mechanism of Action
Botox Cosmetic (botulinum toxin type A) blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to acceptor sites on motor nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. This inhibition occurs as the neurotoxin cleaves SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within nerve endings. When injected intramuscularly at therapeutic doses, Botox Cosmetic produces partial chemical denervation of the muscle resulting in a localized reduction in muscle activity. In addition, the muscle may atrophy, axonal sprouting may occur, and extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors may develop. There is evidence that reinnervation of the muscle may occur, thus slowly reversing muscle denervation produced by Botox Cosmetic. (from Botox prescribing information)

Cimzia is specifically indicated for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.
Cimzia is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous injection. The recommended dose of Cimzia for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis is 400 mg (given as 2 subcutaneous injections of 200 mg each) every other week. For some patients (with body weight â‰¤ 90 kg), CIimzia 400 mg (given as 2 subcutaneous injections of 200 mg each) initially and at Weeks 2 and 4, followed by 200 mg every other week can be considered.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Cimzia for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis was based on three multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies: PS-1, PS-2 and PS-3 which enrolled subjects 18 years of age or older with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who were eligible for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Subjects had a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of â‰¥ 3 (â€œmoderateâ€�) on a 5-category scale of overall disease severity, a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score â‰¥ 12, and body surface area (BSA) involvement of â‰¥ 10%.
Studies PS-1 (234 subjects) and PS-2 (227 subjects) randomized subjects to placebo, Cimzia 200 mg every other week (following a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 4), or Cimzia 400 mg every other week. Studies PS-1 and PS-2 assessed the co-primary endpoints of the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 and PGA of â€œclearâ€� or â€œalmost clearâ€� with at least a 2-point improvement at Week 16. In Study PS-1 PASI 75 was reached by 7% of patients in the placebo arm, 65% of patients in the 200 mg arm; 75% in the 400 mg arm at Week 16. The PGA goal was reached by 4% of the placebo arm, 45% of the patients in the 200 mg arm and 55% in the 400 mg arm. In Study PS-2 PASI 75 was reached by 13% of patients in the placebo arm, 81% of patients in the 200 mg arm; 82% in the 400 mg arm at Week 16. The PGA goal was reached by 3% of the placebo arm, 61% of the patients in the 200 mg arm and 65% in the 400 mg arm.
Study PS-3 randomized 559 subjects to receive placebo, Cimzia 200 mg every other week (following a loading dose of Cimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 4), Cimzia 400 mg every other week up to Week 16, or a biologic comparator (up to Week 12). Study PS-3 assessed the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 at Week 12 as the primary endpoint. PASI 75 at Week 12 was reached by 4%, 69% and 75% of patients in the placebo, Cimzia 200 mg and Cimzia 400 mg arms, respectively.

Dermatology,Clindamycin phosphate topical gel,"General Information
Clindamycin phosphate topical gel, 1% is a topical antibiotic approved for the treatment of acne vulgaris. This drug belongs to the class of antibiotics known as lincosamides. By inhibiting bacteria protein synthesis at the ribosomal level (the site of protein synthesis), clindamycin is believed to kill bacteria associated with acne.
The term ""acne vulgaris"" refers to the more common form of acne, consisting of non-inflammatory and mildly inflammatory lesions. The more severe form of acne is characterized by the presence of nodules. Nearly 17 million people in the United States have acne, making it the most common skin disease. Although acne is not a serious health threat, severe acne can lead to disfiguring, permanent scarring, which can be upsetting for people who suffer from the disorder.
Clinical Results
Trial results indicated that clindamycin phosphate gel was more effective than a vehicle gel in the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. The 12-week, multicenter, randomized, vehicle-controlled trial compared clindamycin phosphate topical gel, 1% once daily to a vehicle gel administered once daily.
The mean percent reduction in lesion counts at the end of treatment was 51% for clindamycin phosphate gel versus 40% for the vehicle gel for inflammatory lesions. For non-inflammatory lesions, the mean percent reduction was 25% for clindamycin phosphate gel and 12% for the vehicle gel. The total mean percent reduction in lesion counts at the end of treatment was 38% for clindamycin phosphate gel and 27% for the vehicle gel.
In a contact sensitization trial, four of the 200 subjects appeared to develop suggestive evidence of allergic contact sensitization to clindamycin phosphate gel. There was no signal for contact sensitization in the clinical trials under normal use conditions.
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions associated with the use of clindamycin phosphate gel include itching and peeling skin.
Cases of diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis have been reported as adverse reactions in subjects treated with oral and parenteral (intravenous) formulations of clindamycin, and have been reported rarely with topical clindamycin. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal disturbances, as well as gram-negative folliculitis (bacterial infection and inflammation of hair follicles), have also been reported in association with the use of topical formulations of clindamycin.
","Additional Information
Additional information on acne can be found at the American Academy of Dermatology.","Mechanism of Action
Although clindamycin phosphate is inactive in vitro, rapid in vitro hydrolysis converts this compound to clindamycin which has antibacterial activity. Clindamycin inhibits bacteria protein synthesis at the ribosomal level by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit and affecting the process of peptide chain initiation. (from FDA label)

Dalvance is specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by susceptible isolates of the following Gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillinÂ­susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus anginosus group (including S. anginosus, S. intermedius, S. constellatus).
Dalvance is supplied as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution into a solution for intravenous administration. The recommended two-dose regimen of Dalvance is 1000 mg followed one week later by 500 mg. Dalvance should be administered over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Dalvance was based on two randomized, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trials of similar design (Trial 1 and Trial 2). The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population included 1,312 randomized patients. Patients were treated for two weeks with either a two-dose regimen of intravenous Dalvance (1000 mg followed one week later by 500 mg) or intravenous vancomycin (1000 mg or 15 mg/kg every 12 hours, with the option to switch to oral linezolid after 3 days). Dalvance-treated patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min received 750 mg followed one week later by 375 mg. The primary endpoint of these two ABSSSI trials was the clinical response rate where responders were defined as patients who had no increase from baseline in lesion area 48 to 72 hours after initiation of therapy, and had a temperature consistently at or below 37.6Â° C upon repeated measurement. The percentage of responders is as follows: Trial 1: Dalvance: 83.3% and Vancomycin/Linezolid: 81.8%; Trial 2: Dalvance: 76.8% and Vancomycin/Linezolid: 78.3%.

Breo Ellipta is a combination of fluticasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and vilanterol, a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).
BreoEllipta is specifically indicated for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. Breo Ellipta is also indicated to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations.
Breo Ellipta is supplied as a powder for inhalation. The recommended dose is 100 mcg/25 mcg administered as 1 inhalation once daily by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Breo Ellipta should be taken at the same time every day. Do not use more than 1 time every 24 hours.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Breo Ellipta was based on 4 confirmatory trials of 6- and 12-monthsâ€™ duration, three 12-week active comparator trials, and dose-ranging trials of shorter duration.
Dose-Ranging Trials
Vilanterol: Dose selection for vilanterol in COPD was supported by a 28-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial evaluating 5 doses of vilanterol (3 to 50 mcg) or placebo dosed in the morning in 602 patients with COPD. Results demonstrated dose-related increases in FEV1 compared with placebo at Day 1 and Day 28 . These results supported the evaluation of vilanterol 25 mcg in the confirmatory COPD trials. Fluticasone furoate: Eight doses of fluticasone furoate ranging from 25 to 800 mcg once daily were evaluated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week trials in subjects with asthma. A dose-related increase in trough FEV1 at Week 8 was seen for doses from 25 to 200 mcg with no consistent additional benefit for doses above 200 mcg. To evaluate dosing frequency, a separate trial compared fluticasone furoate 200 mcg once-daily, fluticasone furoate 100 mcg twice-daily, fluticasone propionate 100 mcg twice-daily, and fluticasone propionate 200 mcg twice-daily. The results supported the selection of the once-daily dosing frequency. Based on the dose-ranging trials in asthma and COPD, once-daily doses of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50 mcg/25 mcg, 100 mcg/25 mcg, and 200 mcg/25 mcg were evaluated in the confirmatory COPD trials.
Confirmatory Trials
Four confirmatory trials in subjects with COPD were designed to evaluate the efficacy of Breo Ellipta on lung function (Trials 1 and 2) and exacerbations (Trials 3 and 4).
Trials 1 and 2: Lung Function
These 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials enrolled 2,254 subjects. In Trial 1, subjects were randomized to Breo Ellipta 100 mcg/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 200 mcg/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate 100 mcg, fluticasone furoate 200 mcg, vilanterol 25 mcg, and placebo. In Trial 2, subjects were randomized to Breo Ellipta 100 mcg/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50 mcg/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate 100 mcg, vilanterol 25 mcg, and placebo. All treatments were administered as 1 inhalation once daily. The co-primary efficacy variables in both trials were weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours) postdose on Day 168 and change from baseline in trough FEV1 on Day 169 (the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after the final dose on Day 168). Breo Ellipta 100 mcg/25 mcg demonstrated a larger increase in the weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours) relative to placebo and fluticasone furoate 100 mcg at Day 168. At Day 169, both Trials 1 and 2 demonstrated significant increases in trough FEV1 for all strengths of the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination compared with placebo.

Diabetes Mellitus Type 2,Rybelsus (oral semaglutide),"General Information
Rybelsus is an oral formulation of semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.
Rybelsus is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Rybelsus is supplied as a tablet for oral administration.
Instruct patients to take Rybelsus at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or other oral medications of the day with no more than 4 ounces of plain water only. Waiting less than 30 minutes, or taking Rybelsus with food, beverages (other than plain water) or other oral medications will lessen the effect of Rybelsus by decreasing its absorption. Waiting more than 30 minutes to eat may increase the absorption of Rybelsus. Swallow tablets whole. Do not split, crush, or chew tablets.
Recommended Dosage: Start Rybelsus with 3 mg once daily for 30 days. The 3 mg dose is intended for treatment initiation and is not effective for glycemic control. After 30 days on the 3 mg dose, increase the dose to 7 mg once daily. Dose may be increased to 14 mg once daily if additional glycemic control is needed after at least 30 days on the 7 mg dose. Taking two 7 mg Rybelsus tablets to achieve a 14 mg dose is not recommended. If a dose is missed, the missed dose should be skipped, and the next dose should be taken the following day.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Rybelsus was based on the results from 10 PIONEER clinical trials which included 9,543 adults with type 2 diabetes. The PIONEER trials (PIONEER 1-10) evaluated oral semaglutide versus placebo and versus other type 2 diabetes drugs, including empagliflozin, sitagliptin, liraglutide and dulaglutide. Across the trials, oral semaglutide was shown to reduce A1C and also help patients reduce their body weight. In PIONEER 1 oral semaglutide demonstrated a superior reduction in HbA1c and a superior reduction in body weight at week 26 versus placebo. In PIONEER 1 80% of patients on oral semaglutide 14 mg achieved an HbA1c level below 7% after 26 weeks. In PIONEER 2 oral semaglutide demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c and a statistically significant reduction in weight at week 52 versus empagliflozin. In PIONEER 4 oral semaglutide demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c and a statistically significant change in body weight at week 52 versus Victoza. The PIONEER 7 trial investigated efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment versus sitagliptin. In PIONEER 7 around 60% of patients on oral semaglutide achieved an HbA1c level below 7% at week 52 and oral semaglutide demonstrated a superior body weight reduction at week 52 versus sitagliptin.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Rybelsus may include, but are not limited to, the following:

decreased appetite
vomiting
constipation
The Rybelsus drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning: RISK OF THYROID C-CELL TUMORS
In rodents, semaglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether Rybelsus causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as human relevance of semaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined
Rybelsus is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC and in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of Rybelsus and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g. a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with Rybelsus.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Rybelsus oral treatment or type 2 diabetes, please visit the Rybelsus web page.","Mechanism of Action
Rybelsus (oral semaglutide) is a GLP-1 analogue with 94% sequence homology to human GLP-1. Semaglutide acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist that selectively binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, the target for native GLP-1. GLP-1 is a physiological hormone that has multiple actions on glucose, mediated by the GLP-1 receptors. The principal mechanism of protraction resulting in the long half-life of semaglutide is albumin binding, which results in decreased renal clearance and protection from metabolic degradation. Furthermore, semaglutide is stabilized against degradation by the DPP-4 enzyme. Semaglutide reduces blood glucose through a mechanism where it stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, both in a glucose-dependent manner. Thus, when blood glucose is high, insulin secretion is stimulated and glucagon secretion is inhibited. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a minor delay in gastric emptying in the early postprandial phase.

Diabetes Mellitus Types I and II,Afrezza (insulin human) Inhalation Powder,"General Information
Afrezza is a rapid acting inhaled insulin powder. When the insulin is inhaled through the device, the powder is aerosolized and delivered to the lung.
Afrezza is specifically indicated to improve glycemic control in adult patients with diabetes mellitus.
Limitations of Use: Afrezza is not a substitute for long-acting insulin. Afrezza must be used in combination with long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Afrezza is not recommended for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Afrezza is supplied as a powder to be administered via oral inhalation. Afrezza should be administered at each mealtime. For specific dose requirements and dose adjustments, refer to the Afrezza drug label.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Afrezza was based on the following trial results:
Type I diabetes:
A 24-week, open-label, active-controlled study enrolled 344 subjects inadequately controlled type 1 diabetes to evaluate the glucose lowering effect of mealtime Afrezza used in combination with a basal insulin. Following a 4-week basal insulin optimization period, subjects were randomized to Afrezza (n=174) or insulin aspart (n=170)administered at each meal of the day. Mealtime insulin doses were titrated to glycemic goals for the first 12 weeks and kept stable for the last 12 weeks of the study. At Week 24, treatment with basal insulin and mealtime Afrezza provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the pre-specified requirement for non-inferiority margin of 0.4%. Afrezza provided less HbA1c reduction than insulin aspart, and the difference was statistically significant. More subjects in the insulin aspart group achieved the HbA1c target of â‰¤7%.
Type II diabetes:
A total of 479 adult patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on optimal/maximally tolerated doses of metformin only, or 2 or more oral antidiabetic (OAD) agents participated in a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Following a 6-week run-in period, 353 patients were randomized to Afrezza (n=177) or an inhaled placebo powder without insulin (n=176). Insulin doses were titrated for the first 12 weeks and kept stable for the last 12 weeks of the study. OADs doses were kept stable. At Week 24, treatment with Afrezza plus OADs provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that was statistically significantly greater compared to the HbA1c reduction observed in the placebo group.

Clinical Results
The approval of Humalog was based on data from worldwide clinical studies that included approximately 3,000 subjects who were evaluated over three years. Diabetics who participated in clinical trials injected Humalog within 15 minutes of eating a meal instead of injecting regular human insulin between 20 and 45 minutes before. Clinical trial evidence showed that Humalog acted faster than regular human insulin to control blood-glucose levels after a meal.
",,"Additional Information
More than 16 million people in the United States suffer from diabetes, which is the fourth-leading cause of death each year. In the United States alone, the disease costs society some $92 billion each year, according to the American Diabetes Association.
People with diabetes have to monitor blood-glucose levels and sometimes inject insulin several times a day to help their bodies process food. For people who are using regular human insulin, health care professionals recommend that injections be timed at least 30 to 45 minutes prior to a meal to allow the medication to begin working.
A 1995 survey of 453 insulin-using subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes showed that 43% injected insulin closer to their meals than recommended. Only 25% of the subjects surveyed took their insulin more than 30 minutes before they ate. Taking insulin too close to a meal can increase a subject's risk of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) shortly after the meal and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) before the next meal.","Mechanism of Action
Humalog was discovered and developed by scientists who found that the absorption of insulin injected under the skin could be accelerated by changing the order of two amino acids in the human insulin molecule. Humalog is designed to more closely mimic the body's own natural output in response to eating a meal.

Diabetes Mellitus Types I and II,Lantus (insulin glargine [rDNA origin] injection),"General Information
Lantus is the first FDA approved long-acting (basal) recombinant human insulin analog with a once-daily administration and a 24-hour glucose-lowering effect. This biosynthetic insulin, injected subcutaneously and designed to mimic NPH human insulin, is indicated for both adult and pediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes. It may also be used for the treatment of adults with Type 2 diabetes who require basal insulin for the control of hyperglycemia.
The chemical structure of Lantus allows for regulated release of the insulin into the circulation with a glucose-lowering effect over a 24-hour period. In clinical studies, no specific pronounced peak was detected over this period.
Clinical Results
In clinical studies, the efficacy of Lantus, measured by metabolic control, was comparable to NPH human insulin. In addition, Lantus had a slower absorption rate than NPH human insulin. This absorption allowed for a relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24-hours. The glucose-lowering effect was detected over the entire 24-hour period.
","Side Effects
As with other insulin therapies, Lantus can cause the following side effects (with hypoglycemia being the most common adverse effect):
Hypoglycemia
Worsening of diabetic retinopathy
Lipodystrophy
Skin reactions (such as injection-site reaction, pruritus, and rash)*
Allergic reactions
Sodium retention
Edema
*In clinical trials, patients treated with Lantus had a higher incidence of injection-site pain (2.7%) than did patients receiving NPH human insulin (0.7%). In general, the reports of pain were mild and did not require discontinuation of treatment with the insulin therapy.
All patients with diabetes should have regular glucose monitoring.

The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.

Lantus is a sterile solution of insulin glargine for use as an injection. Insulin glargine is a recombinant human insulin analog that is a long-acting (up to 24-hour duration of action), parenteral blood-glucose-lowering agent. Lantus is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli as the production organism. The primary activity of insulin is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.

Diabetes Mellitus Types I and II,NovoLog (insulin aspart),"General Information
Traditional regular human insulin requires people to inject their insulin dosage 30 minutes before eating. NovoLog has faster absorption, faster onset of action and shorter duration of action than regular human insulin. The quick onset of blood sugar lowering after injection of NovoLog allows people with diabetes to inject themselves immediately before eating, offering flexibility to patients.
Clinical Results
The six-month, open-label trial randomized 884 patients with type I diabetes to receive either human insulin thirty minutes before meals or NovoLog immediately before meals. Study results were presented at the American Diabetes Association annual meeting in San Diego on June 22.
Prior to randomization, all subjects received a four-week treatment regimen consisting of human insulin before meals and NPH insulin as basal insulin. HbA1c levels and eight-point daily blood glucose profiles were assessed at six months to evaluate efficacy.
At six months, HbA1c was significantly lower (p=0.005) in the insulin aspart group (7.8% Â± 0.1) than the human insulin group (7.9% Â± 0.2).
Blood glucose levels also showed superior reduction at six months in the insulin aspart group after breakfast, lunch and dinner, and before lunch (156 Â± 3, 137 Â± 3, 153 Â± 3, and 126 Â± 3 mg/dL, respectively) when compared to the human insulin group (185 Â± 5, 162 Â± 4, 168 Â± 4, and 138 Â± 4 mg/dL). The p-value for all comparisons was less than 0.016.
In addition, the prandial blood glucose increments -- defined as the mean of the differences between the blood glucose value 90 minutes after the meal and the blood glucose value just before the meal -- were significantly lower (p = 0.0001) in the NovoLog group (2.2 Â± 2.2 mg/dL) than the human insulin group (28.4 Â± 2.9 mg/dL), the investigators said.
The safety profiles for the two products were similar, with low frequencies of hypoglycemic episodes reported for both treatments. While the overall risk of hypoglycemia was similar, the authors noted that a smaller percentage of episodes occurred between midnight and 6 a.m. in the NovoLog group (16% of episodes vs. 34%). (from fdcreports.com)
","Side Effects
Hypoglycemia and hypokalemia, as well as lipodystrophy and hypersensitivity, are among the potential clinical adverse effects associated with the use of all insulins.
Clinical trials comparing NovoLog with regular human insulin did not demonstrate a difference in adverse reaction frequency.
In controlled clinical trials, small, but evident elevations in alkaline phosphatase were observed in some patients that were treated with NovoLog. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown at this time.
","Additional Information
As will all insulin preparations, the time course of NovoLog action may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on blood supply, injection site, temperature, and physical activity.
NovoLog is sold as NovoRapid outside the US. Novo Nordisk received marketing approval for NovoRapid from the European Union last year, and it is now available in several European countries, such as the United Kingdom and Germany. Other diabetes products currently in development include premixed and long-acting insulin analogues.","Mechanism of Action
The main function of NovoLog is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins bind to insulin receptors on both muscle and fat cells and then lower blood glucose by facilitating the cellular uptake of glucose and simultaneously preventing or slowing the output of glucose from the liver.
In standard mice and rabbit testing, one unit of NovoLog has the same glucose-lowering effect as one unit of regular human insulin. In humans, the effect is more rapid and shorter in duration than regular human insulin, due to NovoLog's faster absorption rate after injection.

Diabetes Mellitus Types I and II,Novolog Mix 70/30,"General Information
Novolog Mix is an insulin analog premix containing 30% rapid-acting insulin aspart and 70% that has been modified into a long-acting formulation. It has been approved in a subcutaneous injection formulation, for the control of hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is an abnormally increased content of sugar in the blood.
Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires a combination of professional medical care and self-management through strict attention to diet, self-medication, and frequent monitoring one's blood sugar level.
Clinical Results
Approval of NovoLog Mix 70/30 is based on results from clinical trials evaluating glycaemic control in subjects with type 1 and 2 diabetes.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of human insulin therapy include (but are not limited to) the following:
Injection site reaction
Lipodystrophy
Pruritus
Rash
Hypoglycemia

Diabetes Mellitus Types I and II,Symlin (pramlintide),"General Information
Symlin (pramlintide) is a antihyperglycemic agent. It is designed to mimic the activity of the naturally occurring hormone amylin, which is secreted together with insulin and is involved in post-prandial glucose control.
Symlin is specifically indicated for the mealtime treatment of Type I and Type II diabetes in combination with standard insulin therapy, in patients who have failed to achieve adequate glucose control on insulin monotherapy. It can be administered to type II diabetics also on metformin or sulfonylurea therapy.
Symlin is supplied as a clear sterile solution designed for subcutaneous injection. Recommended dosing varies depending on whether a patient has Type I or Type II diabetes: for Type I patients, initial recommended dosing is 15 mcg, which should be titrated at 15 mcg increments to a maintenance dose of 30 mcg or 60 mcg as tolerated. For Type II patients, initial dose should be 60 mcg, with a single increment increase to 120 mcg as tolerated. NOTE: Initiation of Symlin therapy may require adjustments to insulin dosing schedules, and should be performed under the close supervision of a healthcare professional.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Approval of Symlin was supported by a number of clinical trials, investigating the drug in both Type I and Type II diabetic in both short- and long-term controlled trials, long term uncontrolled trials, and an open label study.
Type I Diabetes
Symlin was evaluated for the treatment of Type I diabetics (n=1717) in 3 long-term randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Patients received 30 mcg or 60 mcg Symlin in addition to standard insulin therapy; in 2 of the trials, only minimal insulin dose adjustment was allowed, in order to isolate Symlin's efficacy; in the third, insulin dose was adjusted per standard medical practices. Symlin administration was seen to produce significant improvements in a number of measures at 6 months, including: change in HbA1c levels vs. baseline (-0.43%); placebo-subtracted HbA1c levels (-0.33%); change in total body weight (-1.1 kg); and placebo-subtracted total body weight (-1.7 kg).
The drug was also investigated for the treatment of Type I diabetes in a dose titration study. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled patients with relatively good glycemic control (mean HbA1c = 8.1%). In addition to maintained standard insulin regimens, subjects received an initial dose of 15 mcg Symlin or placebo, which was titrated in 15 mcg intervals to 30 mcg or 60 mcg, based on whether subjects experienced significant nausea. Insulin dosing was reduced 30-50% during titration to reduce potential incidence of hypoglycemia. At 6 months, subjects receiving Symlin plus insulin achieved similar reductions in mean HbA1C levels, compared to subjects receiving placebo-plus-insulin (-0.47 +/- 0.07 % vs. -0.49 +/- 0.07 %, respectively), while using a significantly lower total and fast-acting insulin dose (-11.7%, -22.8% from baseline). Symlin also produced weight loss relative to both baseline (-1.33) and placebo-plus-insulin (-2.6 kg)
Finally, Symlin was studied in the treatment of Type I diabetes in an open-label clinical practice setting. Using a flexible dose regimen of insulin, the study enrolled Type I diabetics unable to achieve glycemic control on insulin alone. The addition of Symlin to this regimen significantly reduced mean HbA1c levels (-0.18%) and body weight (-3.0 kg) at 6 months, and reduced total, short-acting, and long-acting insulin (-12.0 +/- 1.36, -21.7 +/- 2.81, and -0.4 +/- 1.59 %, respectively), all relative to baseline.
Type II Diabetes
Symlin was investigated for the treatment of Type II diabetes in a pair of long-term randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Patients received Symlin or placebo, in addition to the patients existing regimens of fixed dose insulin with or without metformin and/or sulfonylurea. Symlin was found to produce significantly superior improvements in reduction in HbA1c levels (-.57 %), placebo-subtracted HbA1c levels (-0.40 %), body weight (-1.5 kg), placebo-subtracted body weight (-1.7 kg), % change in rapid-acting insulin dose (-3.0 %), and % change in long-acting insulin dose (-0.2 %), at 6 months.
Symlin was also investigated in an open-label clinical practice study in the treatment of Type II diabetics whose disease was inadequately controlled by insulin therapy. The trial enrolled 166 patients, who received 120 mcg Symlin in addition to a standard flexible-dose insulin regimen. Results indicated that the drug produced reductions from baseline in mean HbA1c levels (-0.56 +/- 0.15%) and mean body weight (-2.76 +/- 0.34 kg). Symlin administration also reduced necessary doses of total, short-acting and long-acting insulin (-6.4 +/- 2.66 %, -10.3 +/- 4.84 %, and -4.20 +/- 2.42 %, respectively).
Ongoing Study Commitments
A study of Symlin in adolescents ages 12 to less than or equal to 17 years with type 1 and type 2 diabetes to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and relevant pharmacodynamic effects of different subcutaneous doses of the drug.
Final Report Submission: September 30, 2007
A multi-center, open-label, observational study to prospectively collect data that characterize the use of Symlin following introduction into the marketplace. This study will include non-targeted prescribers in the same approximate proportion as targeted prescribers.
Protocol Submission: April 30, 2005
Study Start: September 30, 2005
Final Report Submission: September 30, 2008
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Symlin may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Nausea
Headache
Anorexia
Vomiting
Abdominal Pain
Fatigue
Dizziness
Coughing
In addition, because of Symlin's effect on the rate of gastric emptying, the drug should not be used in combination with drugs that alter gastric motility, and should not be administered simultaneously with orally-delivered drugs, as Symlin may produce changes in drug absorption rates. Further, administration of the drug without adjustment to insulin dosing levels can produce hypoglycemic events: both insulin and Symlin dosing schedules should be carefully monitored under the supervision of a healthcare professional.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Symlin or diabetes, please visit the Symlin web page.","Mechanism of Action
Symlin is an amlyinomimetic, a functional analog of the naturally occurring pancreatic hormone amylin. Amylin has activity in a number of gastrointestinal and glucodynamic systems, and by mimicking its activity, Symlin acts to improve glycemic control through modulation of the rate of gastric emptying, prevention of post-prandial rise in glucagon levels, and by increasing sensations of satiety, thereby reducing caloric intake and potentiating weight loss.

Diabetes Mellitus Types I and II,Tresiba (insulin degludec injection),"General Information
Tresiba (insulin degludec) is a long-acting human insulin analog.
Tresiba is specifically indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with diabetes mellitus.
Tresiba is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous administration. Inject Tresiba subcutaneously once-daily at any time of day into the thigh, upper arm, or abdomen. Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. Individualize and titrate the dose of Tresiba based on the patientâ€™s metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, and glycemic control goal. The recommended days between dose increases is 3 to 4 days. The recommended doses are as follows:
Starting Dose in Insulin NaÃ¯ve Patients:
Type I Diabetes Mellitus: The recommended starting dose of Tresiba in insulin naÃ¯ve patients with type I diabetes is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be administered as a short-acting insulin and divided between each daily meal. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin naÃ¯ve patients with type I diabetes. Type II Diabetes Mellitus: The recommended starting dose of Tresiba in insulin naÃ¯ve patients with type II diabetes mellitus is 10 units once daily.
Starting Dose in Patients Already on Insulin Therapy:
Type I and Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Start Tresiba at the same unit dose as the total daily long or intermediate-acting insulin unit dose.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Tresiba was based on the following trials:
Type I Diabetes

Patients were randomized to Tresiba injected once-daily at the same time each day (with the main evening meal), to Tresiba injected once daily at any time each day or to insulin glargine U-100 injected oncedaily according to the approved labeling. The any time each day Tresiba arm was designed to simulate a worst-case scenario injection schedule of alternating short and long, once daily dosing intervals (i.e., alternating intervals of 8 to 40 hours between doses). Tresiba in this arm was dosed in the morning on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and in the evening on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. Up to three of the following oral antidiabetes agents (metformin, sulfonylureas, glinides or thiazolidinediones) were administered as background therapy in both treatment arms. At week 26, the difference in HbA1c reduction from baseline between Tresiba at alternating times and insulin glargine U-100 was 0.04% with a 95% confidence interval of [-0.12%; 0.20%]. This comparison met the pre-specified non-inferiority margin (0.4%).
Tresiba Administered at the Same Time each Day in Combination with a RapidActing Insulin Analog at Mealtimes:
Study H:
The efficacy of Tresiba was evaluated in a 52-week randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in 992 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on premix insulin, bolus insulin alone, basal insulin alone, oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) alone or any combination thereof. Patients were randomized to Tresiba once-daily with the main evening meal or insulin glargine U-100 once-daily according to the approved labeling. Insulin aspart was administered before each meal in both treatment arms. Up to two of the following oral antidiabetes agents (metformin or pioglitazone) were used as background therapy in both treatment arms. At week 52, the difference in HbA1c reduction from baseline between Tresiba and insulin glargine U-100 was 0.08% with a 95% confidence interval of [-0.05%; 0.21%] and met the prespecified non-inferiority margin (0.4%).
TRESIBA Administered at Any Time each Day as an Add-on to One or Two of the Following Oral Agents: Metformin, Sulfonylurea, or Pioglitazone:
Study I:
The efficacy of Tresiba was evaluated in a 26-week randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in 447 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on one or more oral antidiabetic agent (OADs) at baseline. Patients were randomized to Tresiba once-daily at any time of day or sitagliptin once-daily according to the approved labeling. One or two of the following oral antidiabetes agents (metformin, sulfonylurea or pioglitazone) were also administered in both treatment arms. At the end of 26 weeks, Tresiba provided greater reduction in mean HbA1c compared to sitagliptin (p < 0.001).

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Tresiba or glycemic control in adults with diabetes mellitus, please visit https://www.tresibapro.com/","Mechanism of Action
The primary activity of insulin, including Tresiba, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin also inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. Tresiba forms multi-hexamers when injected into the subcutaneous tissue resulting in a subcutaneous insulin degludec depot. The protracted time action profile of Tresiba is predominantly due to delayed absorption of insulin degludec from the subcutaneous tissue to the systemic circulation and to a lesser extent due to binding of insulin-degludec to circulating albumin.

"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",ACTOplus met (pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride),"General Information
ACTOplus met is a single dose combination of two approved drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes: Actos (pioglitazone) and metformin. Actos reduces insulin resistance and metformin lowers the amount of blood sugar made by the liver.
ACTOplus met is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are already treated with a thiazolidinedione and metformin or who have inadequate glycemic control on a thiazolidinedione alone or metformin alone.
ACTOplus met is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is as follows:
Starting dose for patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy
Based on the usual starting dose of pioglitazone (15-30 mg daily), ACTOplus met may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once or twice daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.
Starting dose for patients who initially responded to pioglitazone monotherapy and require additional glycemic control
Based on the usual starting doses of metformin (500 mg twice daily or 850 mg daily), ACTOplus met may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.
Starting dose for patients switching from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus metformin as separate tablets
ACTOplus met may be initiated with either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strengths based on the dose of pioglitazone and metformin already being taken.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
At the time of FDA approval, no efficacy studies had been conducted with ActoPlus Met single tablets. However, efficacy and safety of the separate components had been previously established. In addition, the the co-administration of the separate components was evaluated for efficacy and safety in two clinical studies, demonstrating the bioequivalence with Actoplus Met.
Study One
This randomized, controlled study enrolled 328 subjects receiving metformin, either alone or in combination with another antihyperglycemic agent, who had inadequate glycemic control. The subjects received either 30 mg of pioglitazone or placebo once daily for 16 weeks in addition to their established metformin regimen. The addition of pioglitazone 30 mg once daily to metformin treatment significantly reduced the mean A1C by 0.83% and the mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) by 37.7 mg/dL at Week 16 from that observed with metformin alone.
Study Two
This randomized, controlled study enrolled 827 subjects receiving metformin, either alone or in combination with another antihyperglycemic agent, who had inadequate glycemic control. The subjects received either 30 mg or 45 mg of pioglitazone once daily for 24 weeks in addition to their established metformin regimen. The mean reductions from Baseline at Week 24 in A1C were 0.80% and 1.01% for the 30 mg and 45 mg doses, respectively. Mean reductions from Baseline in FPG were 38.2 mg/dL and 50.7 mg/dL, respectively.Based on these reductions in A1C and FPG, the addition of pioglitazone to metformin resulted in significant improvements in glycemic control irrespective of the metformin dose.

"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Adlyxin (lixisenatide),"General Information
Adlyxin (lixisenatide) is a once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). GLP-1 is a peptide hormone that is released within minutes after eating a meal. It is known to suppress glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells and stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. Adlyxin increases glucose-dependent insulin release, decreased glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying.
Adlyxin is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise for the treatment of adults with type II diabetes.
Adlyxin is supplied in a disposable pre-filled pen in a single dose of 20 micrograms for subcutaneous administration. Patients will also receive a disposable pre-filled pen in a single dose of 10 micrograms that they should initiate once daily for 14 days. On Day 15, patients should increase dosage to 20 micrograms once daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Adlyxin was based on the GetGoal clinical program, which included 13 clinical trials involving more than 5,000 adults with type II diabetes worldwide. All studies of the GetGoal program successfully met the primary efficacy endpoint of HbA1c reduction. The GetGoal programme established the efficacy and safety profile of lixisenatide 20 Âµg once daily across the spectrum of patients with type 2 diabetes, including patients not treated with anti-diabetic agents, those failing on oral agents and as an adjunct to basal insulin therapy. The main efficacy endpoints were met in all studies, with the baseline to endpoint reductions in HbA1c consistently ranging from 0.7% to 1.0%. In a head-to-head comparison with exenatide 10 Î¼g twice daily, lixisenatide 20 Î¼g once daily was non-inferior for HbA1c reduction, achieved with threefold fewer patients with symptomatic hypoglycemia events and better gastrointestinal tolerability. Three randomised trials of lixisenatide treatment added to basal insulin showed significantly improved glycemic control over placebo, with pronounced postprandial glucose reductions and good tolerability.

"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Amaryl (Glimepiride),"General Information
Amaryl is an insulin-sparing sulfonylurea agent for the treatment of type II diabetes. It is indicated as a first-line therapy to lower blood glucose in people with type II diabetes whose high blood glucose cannot be controlled by diet and exercise alone.
Clinical Results
Clinical research supports the recommendation that Amaryl be used as a monotherapy or in combination with insulin, a unique distinction among members of the sulfonylurea class of diabetes drugs. Amaryl provided highly effective glucose control with a once daily dosing schedule, which helped many type II diabetes subjects achieve 24-hour glucose control, without putting subjects at undue risk for low blood sugar, a complication of overly rigorous control. Highly effective glucose control was observed in a range of subjects including obesity and hypertension--and in traditional at risk populations such as Hispanics and African Americans.
",,"Additional Information
The incidence of diabetes in the United States is on the rise. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases estimates that 16 million Americans have diabetes mellitus, which represents an increase of five million compared with incidence of the disease 10 years ago. Yet, only half of the people believed to have diabetes have been diagnosed. Diabetes is the fourth-leading cause of death by disease in United States.
Type II diabetes, the more prevalent form of the disease, is often referred to as late-onset or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Of the eight million people diagnosed with diabetes, nearly 7.5 million have type II diabetes, and most of them require oral medication alone or in combination with insulin to keep blood sugar levels under control.
Studies on type I (insulin-dependent) diabetics in the landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial indicate that tight control reduced some of the devastating complications of the disease, such as retinopathy, kidney damage, and damage to the nerves that can lead to amputations. According to the American Diabetes Association, it is reasonable to recommend tighter glucose control for the millions of NIDDM subjects because it is presumed that the mechanisms by which glucose causes complications are the same in both forms of diabetes.",
"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Avandamet (rosiglitazone maleate and metformin HCl),"General Information
Avandamet (rosiglitazone maleate and metformin HCl) has been approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes patients who are already treated with combination rosiglitazone and metformin or who are not adequately controlled on metformin alone.
Avandamet, available in oral tablet formulation, is the first treatment to combine this combination of drugs in one pill.
Clinical Results
Clinical studies have been conducted with the combination of rosiglitazone maleate and metformin HCl, as well as with each component alone. These studies have shown that the products are safe and effective in controlling blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes patients.
No efficacy studies have been conducted for Avandamet tablets. However, Avandamet has been shown to be bioequivalent to co-administered rosiglitazone maleate tablets and metformin hydrochloride tablets.
","Side Effects
In clinical trials of rosiglitazone maleate in combination with metformin hydrochloride 2500 mg/day, the following adverse events were reported most frequently:
Upper respiratory tract infection
Diarrhea
Injury
Anemia
Headache
Sinusitis
Fatigue
Back pain
Viral infection
Arthralgia
Hyperglycemia
A small number of people who have been treated with metformin have developed the serious yet rare condition called lactic acidosis (a build up of lactic acid in the blood). Most often, lactic acidosis occurs in people with kidney problems, and it can be fatal.
Rosiglitazone may cause fluid retention, especially if it is used with insulin. Untreated fluid retention could lead to or worsen heart failure.
Avandamet should not be used with insulin, and should not be used by patients with kidney disease, congestive heart failure, or liver disease.
","Additional Information
For more information about Avandamet, please visit the GlaxoSmithKline web site at www.gsk.com.","Mechanism of Action
Rosiglitazone maleate is a member of the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic agents and is a PPARgamma agonist. It improves glycemic control by improving insulin sensitivity while reducing circulating insulin levels.
Metformin hydrochloride is a member of the biguanide class of antidiabetic agents. It decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged, while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease. (from FDA prescription label)

"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Bydureon (exenatide extended-release for injectable suspension),"General Information
Bydureon is an extended-release formulation of exenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist that enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cell, suppresses inappropriately elevated glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying.
Bydureon is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes mellitus in multiple clinical settings.
Bydureon is supplied as a powder suspension to be reconstituted into a solution. The recommended dose is 2 mg administered once every seven days (weekly). The dose can be administered at any time of day, with or without meals. Bydureon is administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm region.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Bydureon was based on a 24-week comparator-controlled study> This randomized, open-label trial was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of Bydureon to Byetta in 252 subjects with type II diabetes and inadequate glycemic control with diet and exercise alone or with oral antidiabetic therapy, including metformin, a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, or combination of two of those therapies. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive Bydureon 2 mg once every seven days (weekly) or Byetta (10 mcg twice-daily), in addition to existing oral antidiabetic agents. Subjects assigned to Byetta initiated treatment with 5 mcg twice-daily then increased the dose to 10 mcg twice-daily after 4 weeks. The mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 (or the last value at time of early discontinuation). The mean change from baseline was for Bydureon -1.6 and for -0.9 Byetta. The percentage achieving HbA1c <7% at Week 24 was 58% in the Bydureon arm and 30% in the Byetta arm. Reductions from mean baseline (97/94 kg) in body weight were observed in both Bydureon (-2.3 kg) and Byetta (-1.4 kg) treatment groups.

Bydureon is an extended-release formulation of exenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist that enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cell, suppresses inappropriately elevated glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying. The amino acid sequence of exenatide partially overlaps that of human GLP-1. Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that has been shown to bind and activate the human GLP-1 receptor in vitro. This leads to an increase in both glucose-dependent synthesis of insulin and in vivo secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells, by mechanisms involving cyclic AMP and/or other intracellular signaling pathways. Exenatide promotes insulin release from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations.
"
"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Byetta (exenatide),"General Information
Byetta (exenatide), derived from a compound found in the saliva of the Gila monster, a large lizard native to the southwestern US, is a functional analog of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1), a naturally occuring peptide which enhances insulin secretion in response to elevated plasma glucose levels. By mimicking the function of GLP-1, the drug helps more strongly activate this pathway to improve glycemic control.
Byetta is specifically indicated as adjunctive therapy to improve glycemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who are taking metformin, a sulfonylurea, or a combination of both, but have not achieved adequate glycemic control.
Byetta is supplied as as a sterile solution for subcutaneous injection. The recommended initial dose is 5 mcg twice daily, anytime within the 60 minute period prior to the monring and evening meal. This dose may be escalated to 10 mcg twice daily after 1 month, based on response
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Approval of Byetta was based on 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy clinical trials, which enrolled a combined 1446 subjects with type 2 diabetes. Each trial combined the two now-approved doses of Byetta or placebo with existing therapy: with metformin in one trial (336 total subjects), with sulfonylurea in the second trial (377 total subjects), and with both drugs in the third (733 total subjects). The primary endpoint in all 3 trials was change from baseline in HbA1c levels at 30 weeks, a measure of long term glycemic control. Secondary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of subjects achiving HbA1c levels at or below 7% (a level considered ""normal"") at week 30, and mean change in body weight at week 30. The addition of Byetta was seen to reduce mean HbA1c levels in combination with metformin (+0.1% for placebo vs. -0.4% at 5 mcg, p<0.05; -0.8% at 10 mcg, p<0.0001), sulfonylurea (+0.1% vs. -0.5%, p<0.05; -0.9%, p<0.0001), and both drugs (+0.2%, vs. -0.6%, p<0.0001; -0.8%, p<0.0001). The mean proportion of subjects achiving HbA1c levels at or below 7% was significant for all Byetta groups in all 3 trials, and subjects receiving Byetta achieved significantly greater weight loss in all trial groups except the 5 mcg dose group in combination with sulfonylurea, which trended towards improvement. These results indicated that Byetta in combination metformin, sulfonylurea or both produced superior recudtions in fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels, brought a greater portion of subjects into normal glucose ranges, and produced greater reductions in mean body weight than either or both drugs alone.
Ongoing Study Commitments

Most episodes of hypoglycemia were mild-to-moderate, and resolvable with carbohydrate supplementation.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Byetta or Type 2 diabetes mellitus, please visit the Byetta web page.","Mechanism of Action
Byetta is a functional analog of the human incretin Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) . Incretins enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion and exhibit other antihyperglycemic actions following their release into the circulation from the gut. The GLP-1 system increases insulin secretion only in the presence of elevated plasma glucose levels, avoiding inappropriately high insulin levels during fasting. The drug also moderates peak serum glucagon levels during hyperglycemic periods following meals, but does not interfere with glucagon release in response to hypoglycemia. Secondary effects of drug administration reduces the rate of gastric emptying and decreases food intake, mitigating the potential severity of hyperglycemic events after meals.

"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Cycloset, bromocriptine mesylate","General Information
Cycloset is a quick release formulation of micronized bromocriptine mesylate (bromocriptine-QR). It is a dopamine receptor agonist.
Cycloset is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Cycloset is supplied as a tablet designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 1.6 mg to 4.8 mg administered once daily within two hours after waking in the morning. Cycloset should be initiated at one tablet (0.8 mg) and increased by one tablet per week until a maximum daily dose of 6 tablets (4.8 mg) or until the maximal tolerated number of tablets between 2 and 6 per day is reached.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Cyloset was based on the results of four clinical trials; a 24-week monotherapy trial, two 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trials and a 52-week safety trial. In all four clinical trials, subjects assigned to treatment with Cycloset received an initial dose of 0.8 mg, which was increased by 0.8 mg each week for 6 weeks (4.8 mg/day final dose) if no intolerance occurred or until the maximum tolerated dose > 1.6 mg/day was reached.
Monotherapy Trial
This 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 159 overweight adults with type II diabetes and inadequate glycemic control. The trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cycloset as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Of the 80 subjects in the Cycloset group, 69% (N=55) achieved the maximum daily dose of 4.8 mg. Cycloset improved HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose compared to placebo. Mean HbA1c at baseline was 9.0% in the Cycloset group and 8.8% in the placebo group. The 24-week change from baseline was -0.1 in the Cycloset arm and 0.3 in the placebo arm (a -0.4 difference from placebo; pâ‰¡0.05). The mean baseline fasting plasma glucose (mg/dl) was 215 in the Cycloset arm and 205 in the placebo arm. At 24 weeks, the adjusted mean change from placebo was -23 (p=0.005). Mean change from baseline in body weight was +0.2 kg in the Cycloset group and +0.5 kg in the placebo group.
Combination Therapy
Study L This 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 249 subjects with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c 7.8-12.5%) on sulfonylurea therapy. The study was designed to evaluate the safety and glycemic efficacy of Cycloset when added to stable sulfonylurea therapy versus placebo plus sulfonylurea. The mean baseline HbA1C was 9.3% in the Cycloset arm and 9.4% in the placebo arm. At 24 weeks, the adjusted mean from baseline was -0.4% and 0.3 for Cycloset and placebo, respectively (-0.6 difference; p< 0.001). The baseline FPG was 220 mg/dl in the Cycloset arm and 226 mg/dl in the placebo arm. At 24 weeks, the adjusted mean change from baseline was 3 mg/dl and 23 mg/dl, respectively (-20 difference; pâ‰¡0.006). The mean change from baseline in body weight was +0.9 kg in the Cycloset group and +0.5 kg in the placebo group. Study K This 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 245 subjects with type II diabetes and inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c 7.8-12.5 %) on stable sulfonylurea therapy who were randomized to add-on therapy with either Cycloset or placebo. Of the 122 subjects in the Cycloset group, 91 (75%) achieved the maximum dose of study drug. Mean change from baseline in body weight was +1.4 kg in the Cycloset group and +0.5 kg in the placebo group. The mean baseline HbA1C was 9.3% in the Cycloset arm and 9.4% in the placebo arm. At 24 weeks, the adjusted mean from baseline was -0.1% and 0.4% for Cycloset and placebo, respectively (-0.5 difference; p< 0.001). The baseline FPG was 216 mg/dl in the Cycloset arm and 227 mg/dl in the placebo arm. At 24 weeks, the adjusted mean change from baseline was 10 mg/dl and 28 mg/dl, respectively (-18 difference; pâ‰¡0.02).
Cycloset add-on to various oral anti-diabetic agents: 52 week safety trial
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety trial enrolled approximately 3,000 subjects with type II diabetes receiving various anti-diabetic therapies (mean baseline HbA1c 8.3%). Approximately 70% of subjects assigned to treatment with Cycloset reached the maximum daily dose of 4.8 mg. Mean baseline HbA1c was 7.0% in both treatment groups. The least-squares mean change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 was 0.0% with Cycloset and +0.2% with placebo. Subjects receiving Cycloset, compared to placebo, experienced a significant improvement in HbA1c when used as adjunctive therapy to 1-2 oral antidiabetic medications, including the subgroup of patients treated only with background metformin + sulfonylurea. The mean change in body weight for the glycemic efficacy subgroup from baseline to Week 24 was -0.1 kg with Cycloset and +0.1 kg. The mean change in body weight for the entire study population from baseline to Week 52 was +0.2 kg with Cycloset and +0.1 kg with placebo.
Additional Trials:
Patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control on diet alone were randomized to Cycloset or placebo in a 24-week monotherapy clinical trial. At baseline and study end, plasma samples for insulin and glucose were obtained before and 1 hour, and 2 hours after standardized meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In this trial, once-daily (8am) Cycloset improved postprandial glucose without increasing plasma insulin concentrations.
Patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control on sulfonylurea therapy were randomized to Cycloset or placebo in a 16-week clinical trial. In this trial Cycloset therapy improved insulin-mediated glucose disposal and glucose tolerance and resulted in lower plasma glucose and HbA1c levels.

"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Farxiga (dapagliflozin),"General Information
Farxiga (dapagliflozin) is an orally active sodium glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor. Inhibiting SGLT2 activity modulates reabsorption of glucose in the kidney, resulting in excretion of glucose in the urine.
Farxiga is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes mellitus.
Farxiga is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, taken in the morning, with or without food. The dose can be increased to 10 mg once daily in patients tolerating Farxiga who require additional glycemic control. Renal function should be assessed before initiating Farxiga. Do not initiate Farxiga if eGFR is below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Farxiga should be discontinued if eGFR falls persistently below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Farxiga was based on monotherapy and combination studies, when combined with metformin, pioglitazone, glimepiride, sitagliptin (with or without metformin), or insulin (with or without other oral antidiabetic therapy).
Monotherapy Studies
Two placebo controlled studies were conducted in 840 treatment-naive subjects with inadequately controlled type II diabetes. One of these was a 24-week study in 558 subjects. Following a 2-week diet and exercise placebo lead-in period, 485 subjects with HbA1c >7% and <10% were randomized to Farxiga 5 mg or 10 mg once daily in either the morning (QAM, main cohort) or evening (QPM), or placebo. At Week 24, treatment with Farxiga 10 mg QAM provided significant improvements in HbA1c and FPG compared with placebo. Change from baseline in HbA1c for Farxiga: -.9 vs. placebo: -.2; change from baseline in FPG for Farxiga: -28.8 vs. placebo: -4.1.
Combination Therapy Studies
The combination treatment of Farxiga 10 mg plus metformin XR provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and FPG compared with either of the monotherapy treatments and statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with metformin XR alone. Farxiga 10 mg as monotherapy also provided statistically significant improvements in FPG and statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with metformin alone and was noninferior to metformin XR monotherapy in lowering HbA1c. The combination treatment of Farxiga 5 mg plus metformin XR provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and FPG compared with either of the monotherapy treatments and statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with metformin XR alone. As add-on treatment to metformin, Farxiga 10 mg provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c and FPG, and statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo at Week 24 Statistically significant (p<0.05 for both doses) mean changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure relative to placebo plus metformin were -4.5 mmHg and -5.3 mmHg with FARXIGA 5 mg and 10 mg plus metformin, respectively. Farxiga led to a similar mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline at Week 52 (LOCF), compared with glipizide, thus demonstrating noninferiority . Farxiga treatment led to a statistically significant mean reduction in body weight from baseline at Week 52 (LOCF) compared with a mean increase in body weight in the glipizide group. Statistically significant (p<0.0001) mean change from baseline in systolic blood pressure relative to glipizide plus metformin was -5.0 mmHg with Farxiga plus metformin. In combination with glimepiride, Farxiga 10 mg provided statistically significant improvement in HbA1c, FPG, and 2-hour PPG, and statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo plus glimepiride at Week 24. In combination with pioglitazone, treatment with Farxiga 10 mg provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c, 2-hour PPG, FPG, the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7%, and a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with the placebo plus pioglitazone treatment groups. In combination with sitagliptin (with or without metformin), Farxiga 10 mg provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with the placebo plus sitagliptin (with or without metformin) group at Week 24. When combined with insulin, at Week 24, Farxiga 10 mg dose provided statistically significant improvement in HbA1c and reduction in mean insulin dose, and a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo in combination with insulin, with or without up to 2 OADs; the effect of Farxiga on HbA1c was similar in patients treated with insulin alone and patients treated with insulin plus OAD. Statistically significant (p<0.05) mean change from baseline in systolic blood pressure relative to placebo in combination with insulin was -3.0 mmHg with Farxiga 10 mg in combination with insulin. At Week 24, Farxiga 5 mg (-5.7 IU, difference from placebo) and 10 mg (-6.2 IU, difference from placebo) once daily resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean daily insulin dose (p<0.0001 for both doses) compared to placebo in combination with insulin, and a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients on Farxiga 10 mg (19.6%) reduced their insulin dose by at least 10% compared to placebo (11.0%).
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Farxiga may include, but are not limited to, the following:
female genital mycotic infections
nasopharyngitis
urinary tract infections
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Farxiga or type II diabetes, please visit the Farxiga web page.","Mechanism of Action
Farxiga (dapagliflozin) is an inhibitor of Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2). SGLT2 is expressed in the proximal renal tubules and is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen. By inhibiting SGLT2, dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.

"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Glyset (miglitol),"General Information
Glyset has been approved for the treatment of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
Clinical Results
Two large studies undertaken by Bayer have shown that Glyset is particularly effective among Hispanic and African-American Type II patients. This is significant because Type II diabetes is more prevalent and is more commonly associated with complications in these subpopulations compared to Caucasian Type II patients.
Hispanics have a 300 percent higher chance of developing Type II diabetes than the general population and African-Americans are 60 percent more likely to develop Type II diabetes than Caucasians. Hispanic and African-American Type II patients have been typically under-represented in clinical trials of new diabetes therapies. The demonstration of Glysetâ€™s efficacy and safety in these sub-populations confirm its importance as a therapeutic option for these patients.
In study 1, a one-year study in which Glyset was evaluated as monotherapy and also as combination therapy, there was a statistically significantly smaller increase in mean glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) over time in the miglitol 50 mg 3 times daily monotherapy arm compared to placebo. Significant reductions in mean fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels and in mean postprandial insulin levels were observed in Glyset-treated patients compared with the placebo group.
In study 2, a 14-week study, there was a significant decrease in HbA1c in patients receiving Glyset 50 mg 3 times daily or 100 mg 3 times daily compared to placebo. In addition, there were significant reductions in postprandial plasma glucose and postprandial serum insulin levels compared to placebo.
","Side Effects
Unlike sulfonylureas, another class of drugs to treat Type II diabetes, Glyset and Precose do not cause hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinemia or weight gain. If side effects occur with Glyset they usually develop during the first few weeks of therapy and are most commonly mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal effects, such as flatulence, soft stools or diarrhea, or abdominal pain. Many of these effects diminish in frequency and intensity over time. Studies have shown no evidence of serious side effects.
Glyset is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug and in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration or partial intestinal obstruction. Glyset is also contraindicated in patients who have chronic intestinal diseases associated with marked disorders of digestion or absorption and in patients who have conditions that may deteriorate as a result of increased gas formation in the intestine.
",,"Mechanism of Action
In contrast to sulfonylureas, GLYSET does not enhance insulin secretion. The antihyperglycemic action of miglitol results from a reversible inhibition of membrane-bound intestinal a-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in delayed glucose absorption and lowering of poptprandial hyperglycemia.
Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of Glyset to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas when used in combination. In addition, GLYSET diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas.
Miglitol has minor inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently, at the recommended doses, would not be expected to induce lactose intolerance."
"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Invokana (canagliflozin),"General Information
Invokana (canagliflozin) is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. Inhibiting SGLT2 is believed to reduce blood glucose levels by increasing the amount of glucose excreted in the urine.
Invokana is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Invokana was subsequently approved to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. Invokana was approved in September of 2019 to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), worsening of kidney function, cardiovascular (CV) death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (nephropathy) with a certain amount of protein in the urine.
Invokana is supplied as tablets for oral administration. The recommended starting dose of Invokana is 100 mg once daily, taken before the first meal of the day. In patients tolerating Invokana 100 mg once daily who have an eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater and require additional glycemic control, the dose can be increased to 300 mg once daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Invokana was based in part on a monotherapy study. Invokana was also studied in combination with metformin, sulfonylurea, metformin and sulfonylurea, metformin and a thiazolidinedione and in combination with insulin (with or without other antihyperglycemic agents). The efficacy of Invokana was compared to a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (sitagliptin) and a sulfonylurea (glimepiride).
Monotherapy Study
A a 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 584 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise. Patients taking other antihyperglycemic agents discontinued the agent and underwent an 8-week washout followed by a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period. Patients not taking oral antihyperglycemic agents entered the 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period directly. After the placebo run-in period, subjects were randomized to Invokana 100 mg, 300 mg, or placebo, administered once daily for 26 weeks. At the end of treatment, Invokana 100 mg and 300 mg once daily resulted in a statistically significant improvement in HbA1C (p-value <0.001 for both doses) compared to placebo. Invokana 100 mg and 300 mg once daily also resulted in a greater proportion of patients achieving an HbA1C less than 7%, in significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), in improved postprandial glucose (PPG), and in percent body weight reduction compared to placebo. Statistically significant mean changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure relative to placebo were -3.7 mmHg and -5.4 mmHg with Invokana 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively (p<0.001 for both doses).
Efficacy Studies
Invokana compared to glimepiride, both as add-on combination with metformin
A 52-week, double-blind, active controlled study enrolled 1,450 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. Subjects received Invokana 100 mg or 300 mg, or glimepiride (titration allowed throughout the 52-week study to 6 or 8 mg), administered once daily as add-on therapy to metformin. Invokana 100 mg provided similar reductions in HbA1C from baseline compared to glimepiride when added to metformin therapy. Invokana 300 mg provided a greater reduction from baseline in HbA1C compared to glimepiride, and the relative treatment difference was -0.12%. Treatment with Invokana 100 mg and 300 mg daily provided greater improvements in percent body weight change, relative to glimepiride.
Invokana compared to sitagliptin, both as add-on combination therapy with metformin and sulfonylurea
A 52-week, double-blind, active-controlled study enrolled 755 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on the combination of metformin and sulfonylurea. The subjects received Invokana 300 mg or sitagliptin 100 mg in combination with metformin and sulfonylurea. Invokana 300 mg provided greater HbA1C reduction compared to sitagliptin 100 mg when added to metformin and sulfonylurea (p<0.05).
Invokana 300 mg resulted in a mean percent change in body weight from baseline of -2.5% compared to +0.3% with sitagliptin 100 mg. A mean change in systolic blood pressure from baseline of -5.06 mmHg was observed with Invokana 300 mg compared to +0.85 mmHg with sitagliptin 100 mg.
The FDA approval of Invokana to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events was based on the CANVAS (CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study) Program which evaluated the effect of Invokana on CV risk in a broad population of more than 10,000 adults with T2D who had established CV disease (65 percent) or were at risk for cardiovascular disease with two or more risk factors (35 percent). Overall, treatment with Invokana as compared with placebo in addition to standard of care reduced the combined risk of heart attack, stroke and CV death by 14% (events occurred in 26.9 vs. 31.5 participants, respectively, per 1000 patient-years). In patients with established CV disease, treatment with Invokana reduced the combined risk of heart attack, stroke and CV death by 18% compared to placebo (events occurred in 34.1 vs. 41.3 participants, respectively, per 1000 patient-years).
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Invokana may include, but are not limited to, the following:
female genital mycotic infections
urinary tract infection
increased urination
The Invokana drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning: LOWER LIMB AMPUTATION â€¢ An approximately 2-fold increased risk of lower limb amputations associated with Invokana use was observed in CANVAS and CANVAS-R, two large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in patients with type 2 diabetes who had established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or were at risk for CVD. â€¢ Amputations of the toe and midfoot were most frequent; however, amputations involving the leg were also observed. Some patients had multiple amputations, some involving both limbs. â€¢ Before initiating, consider factors that may increase the risk of amputation, such as a history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy, and diabetic foot ulcers. â€¢ Monitor patients receiving Invokana for infection, new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs, and discontinue if these complications occur.

"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Januvia (sitagliptin phosphate),"General Information
Januvia is an orally-active inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme. The DPP-4 enzyme inactivates incretin hormones, which are involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. By inhibiting DPP-4, Januvia increases and prolongs active incretin levels. This in turn increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner.
Januvia is specifically indicated for the improvement of glycemic control in patients with type II diabetes mellitus as monotherapy or combination therapy with metformin or a peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPAR) agonist (e.g., thiazolidinediones) when the single agent does not provide adequate glycemic control.
Januvia is supplied as 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg tablets designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 100 mg once daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Januvua was based on the pooled results of two double-blind, placebo controlled monotherapy studies and two double-blind, placebo controlled combination therapy studies.
Monotherapy Trials
The Januvia monotherapy trials had one with an 18 week duration and one with a 24 week duration. In the 18-week study, 521 subjects were randomized to placebo, Januvia 100 mg, or Januvia 200 mg, and in the 24-week study 741 subjects were randomized to placebo, Januvia 100 mg, or Januvia 200 mg. In both trials subjects went under a 7 week washout period then completed a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, before receiving treatment. Treatment with Januvia at 100 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo. In the 18-week study, 9% of patients receiving Januvia 100 mg and 17% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week study, 9% of patients receiving Januvia 100 mg and 21% of patients receiving placebo required rescue therapy. The 200 mg daily dose did not provide greater glycemic efficacy than the 100 mg daily dose in either trial.
Combination Therapy Trials
The first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 701 subjects. It was designed to compare Januvia in combination with metformin as treatment for 24 weeks. Subjects already on metformin at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Subjects on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent and subjects not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Subjects were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of Januvia or placebo, administered once daily. This combination provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin. Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of those treated with Januvia 100 mg and 14% of those treated with placebo.
The second randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 353 subjects. It was designed to evaluate Januvia in combination with pioglitazone as treatment for 24 weeks. Patients on any oral antihyperglycemic agent in monotherapy or on a PPAR agent in combination therapy or not on an antihyperglycemic agent (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) were switched to monotherapy with pioglitazone (at a dose of 30-45 mg per day), and completed a run-in period of approximately 12 weeks in duration. After the run-in period on pioglitazone monotherapy, patients were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of Januvia or placebo, administered once daily. This combination therapy demonstrated significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo with pioglitazone. Rescue therapy was used in 7% of patients treated with Januvia 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo.

"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Jentadueto (linagliptin plus metformin hydrochloride),"General Information
Jentadueto is a fixed dose combination of linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, plus metformin, which helps to control the amount of glucose in the blood.
Jentadueto is specifically approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes mellitus when treatment with both linagliptin and metformin is appropriate.
Jentadueto is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. Jentadueto should be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerability, while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 2.5 mg linagliptin/1000 mg metformin twice daily. The recommended starting dose is as follows:
Subjects not currently treated with metformin: initiate treatment with 2.5 mg linagliptin/500 mg metformin hydrochloride twice daily
Subjects already treated with metformin: start with 2.5 mg linagliptin and the current dose of metformin taken at each of the two daily meals
Subjects already treated with linagliptin and metformin: individual components may be switched to Jentadueto containing the same doses of each component.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Jentadueto was based on clinical trials that evaluated linagliptin and metformin as separate tablets. Bioequivalence of Jentadueto was demonstrated with co-administered linagliptin and metformin tablets in healthy subjects. A 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled factorial study enrolled 791 adults with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control with diet and exercise who received linagliptin plus metformin concurrently. At the maximum dose (2.5 mg linagliptin/1,000 mg metformin twice-daily) Jentadueto demonstrated placebo-corrected reductions in hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c) levels of up to 1.7% (+0.1% for placebo and -1.6% for Jentadueto).

Jentadueto is a fixed dose combination of linagliptin plus metformin. Linagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibito. DDP-4 is an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotrophic polypeptide. Thus, linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the increase of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the levels of glucagon in the circulation. Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose.

"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Metaglip (glipizide/metformin HCl),"General Information
Metaglip combines glipizide and metformin HCl two prescribed oral antidiabetic agents in a single pill. These agents work in complementary fashion to improve blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Metaglip is indicated as initial therapy, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily managed with diet and exercise alone. Metaglip is also indicated as second-line therapy when diet, exercise, and initial treatment with a sulfonylurea or metformin do not result in adequate glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Clinical Results
In clinical trials, Metaglip was shown to be more effective at lowering blood sugar levels than either glipizide or metformin used alone in patients with type 2 diabetes. In a 24-week, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter international clinical trial, patients with type 2 diabetes, whose hyperglycemia was not adequately controlled with diet and exercise alone were randomized to receive initial therapy with glipizide (5 mg), metformin (500 mg), Metaglip (2.5 mg/250 mg), or Metaglip (2.5 mg/500 mg).
After 24 weeks, treatment with Metaglip resulted in significantly greater reduction in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) compared to glipizide and to metformin therapy. Also, Metaglip therapy resulted in significant reductions in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) versus metformin therapy. Increases above fasting glucose and insulin levels were determined at baseline and final study visits by measurement of plasma glucose and insulin for three hours following a standard mixed liquid meal. Treatment with Metaglip lowered the three-hour postprandial glucose AUC, compared to baseline, to a significantly greater extent than did the glipizide and the metformin therapies.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Metaglip may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Upper respiratory infection
Diarrhea
Dizziness
Hypertension
Nausea/vomiting
Headache
Musculoskeletal pain
Abdominal pain
Urinary tract infection
","Additional Information
For more information on Metaglip or Type-2 Diabetes, please contact The Bristol-Myers Squibb Web Site","Mechanism of Action
Metaglip combines glipizide and metformin hydrochloride, two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action, to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Glipizide appears to lower blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Extrapancreatic effects may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs.
Metformin hydrochloride is an antihyperglycemic agent that improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.

"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Onglyza (saxagliptin),"General Information
Onglyza (saxagliptin) is an orally-active inhibitor of the DPP4 enzyme. D-PP4 inhibitors are a class of compounds that work by affecting the action of natural hormones in the body called incretins. Incretins decrease blood sugar by increasing consumption of sugar by the body, mainly through increasing insulin production in the pancreas, and by reducing production of sugar by the liver.
Onglyza is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Onglyza is supplied as a 5 mg and 2.5 mg tablet designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 2.5 mg or 5 mg once daily taken regardless of meals. The 2.5 mg daily dosage is recommended for 1) patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease and 2) for patients also taking strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Onglyza was based on monotherapy trials and in trials combining Onglyza with metformin, glyburide, and thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) therapy.
Monotherapy
A total of 766 subjects with type II diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise participated in two 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.
Study One
Following a 2-week single-blind diet, exercise, and placebo lead-in period, 401 subjects were randomized to 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of Onglyza or placebo. Subjects who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with metformin rescue therapy, added on to placebo or Onglyza. Treatment with Onglyza 2.5 mg and 5 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared to placebo. The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 16% in the Onglyza 2.5 mg treatment group, 20% in the Onglyza 5 mg treatment group, and 26% in the placebo group.
Study Two
This 24-week monotherapy trial enrolled 365 treatment-naive subjects with inadequately controlled diabetes. Following a 2-week, single-blind diet, exercise, and placebo lead-in period, the subjects were randomized to 2.5 mg every morning, 5 mg every morning, 2.5 mg with possible titration to 5 mg every morning, or 5 mg every evening of Onglyza or placebo. Treatment with either Onglyza 5 mg every morning or 5 mg every evening provided significant improvements in A1C versus placebo (mean placebo-corrected reductions of -0.4% and -0.3%, respectively). Treatment with Onglyza 2.5 mg every morning also provided significant improvement in A1C versus placebo (mean placebo-corrected reduction of 0.4%).
Combination Therapy
In trials evaluating Onglyza in combination with metformin, glyburide, and thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone), Onglyza 2.5 mg and 5 mg plus combination provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo plus combination.

Onglyza (saxagliptin) is an orally-active inhibitor of the DPP4 enzyme. D-PP4 inhibitors work by affecting the action of natural hormones in the body called incretins .Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. This saxagliptin is a competitive DPP4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner

"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Ozempic (semaglutide),"General Information
Ozempic (semaglutide) is a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.
Ozempic is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Ozempic is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous injection into the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. The recommended starting dose is 0.25 mg once weekly. After 4 weeks, the dose should be increased to 0.5 mg once weekly. If after at least 4 weeks additional glycemic control is needed, increase the dose to 1 mg once weekly. Ozempic should be administered once weekly at any time of day, with or without meals. If a dose is missed administer within 5 days of missed dose.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ozempic was based on the results from a global Phase IIIa clinical trial comprised eight clinical trials involving more than 8,000 adults with type II diabetes, including a two-year cardiovascular outcomes trial that evaluated safety in adults with type II diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular events. Ozempic showed clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in A1c compared with placebo, sitagliptin and exenatide extended-release. As a secondary endpoint in the trials, treatment with Ozempic resulted in reductions in body weight.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Ozempic may include, but are not, limited to, the following:
nausea
vomiting
diarrhea
abdominal pain
constipation
The Ozempic drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning:
RISK OF THYROID Câˆ’CELL TUMORS. In rodents, semaglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors. It is unknown whether Ozempic causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma, in humans as the human relevance of semaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Ozempic is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Ozempic or type II diabetes, please visit https://www.ozempicpro.com/","Mechanism of Action
Ozempic (semaglutide) is a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that selectively binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, the target for native GLP-1. GLP-1 is a physiological hormone that has multiple actions on glucose, mediated by the GLP-1 receptors. The principal mechanism of protraction resulting in the long half-life of semaglutide is albumin binding, which results in decreased renal clearance and protection from metabolic degradation. Furthermore, semaglutide is stabilized against degradation by the DPP-4 enzyme. Semaglutide reduces blood glucose through a mechanism where it stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, both in a glucose-dependent manner. Thus, when blood glucose is high, insulin secretion is stimulated and glucagon secretion is inhibited. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a minor delay in gastric emptying in the early postprandial phas

"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Prandin,"General Information
Prandin (repaglinide) has been approved for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. It is the first approved product in a new chemical class (meglitinide class) of orally administered drugs for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, and was developed to manage meal related (prandial) glucose loads.
Clinical Results
In clinical trials, Prandin had its largest effect in the first two weeks. After that, patients were maintained at a dose that triggered response. There was an average reduction in hemoglobin A1c levels of 1.6 to 1.9 points.
","Side Effects
Adverse events reported were comparable to sulfonylureas, but there was a slightly higher incidence of cardiovascular events when compared with glyburide.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Prandin stimulates insulin secretion from the beta cells of the pancreas by binding to sites on the beta cell. Its quick onset and short duration of action concentrates its effect around meal time glucose load, which is important to the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. Prandin is minimally excreted by the kidney, which may be an advantage for patients who suffer from decreased kidney function."
"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",Precose (acarbose),"General Information
Precose is an oral alpha-glucosidase inhibitor for use in the management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Precose, as monotherapy, is indicated as an adjunct to diet to lower blood glucose in subjects with NIDDM whose hyperglycemia cannot be managed on diet alone. Precose may also be used in combination with sulfonylurea when diet plus either Precose or a sulfonylurea do not result in adequate glycemic control. The effect of Precose to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylurea when used in combination, presumably because its mechanism of action is different.
Clinical Results
To evaluate the long-term efficacy of precose in improving glycemic control in subjects with NIDDM, a one-year, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted. The study involved 354 subjects with NIDDM.
Clinical studies demonstrated a strong association between hyperglycemia and an increased risk of microvascular tissue damage. Trials involving Precose established that hemoglobin levels are a more significant predictor of the onset or progression of retinopathy in NIDDM diabetic patients than blood glucose concentration. Precose significantly reduced hemoglobin levels in NIDDM subjects maintained on dietary therapy alone. The magnitude of the treatment effect steadily increased during active treatment; diabetic retinopathy was reduced by approximately 30%. In addition, reduction in postprandial glucose concentrations were observed in subjects receiving Precose.
","Side Effects
Side effects consisted primarily of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, and increased gas production. A smaller incidence of headache and hyperglycemia was also reported.
","Additional Information
The incidence of diabetes in the United States is on the rise. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases estimates that 16 million Americans have diabetes mellitus, which represents an increase of five million compared with the number affected by the disease ten years ago. Yet, only half of the people believed to have diabetes have been diagnosed. Diabetes is the fourth-leading cause of death by disease in the United States.
Type 2 diabetes, the more prevalent form of the disease, is often referred to as late-onset or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Of the eight million people diagnosed with diabetes, nearly 7.5 million have type 2 diabetes, and most of them require oral medication alone or in combination with insulin to keep blood sugar levels under control.
Depending on the disease severity, therapy for NIDDM subjects consists of diet, exercise, weight reduction, sulfonylurea drugs, and/or insulin therapy. The primary therapeutic endpoint in the treatment of diabetes has been to maintain near-normal levels of glycemia with the goal of reducing microvascular and macrovascular complications.","Mechanism of Action
Precose is a complex oligosaccharide that delays the digestion of ingested carbohydrates, thereby resulting in a smaller rise in blood glucose concentration following meals. As a consequence of plasma glucose reduction, Precose reduces levels of glycosylated hemoglobin in subjects with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.

Diabetic Gastroparesis,Metozolv ODT (metoclopramide hydrochloride),"General Information
Metozolv ODT is an orally disintegrating tablet formulation of metoclopramide hydrochloride. Metoclopramide stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. While its mode of action is unclear, it appears to sensitize tissues to the action of acetylcholine.
Metozolv ODT is specifically indicated 1) as short-term (4 to 12 weeks) therapy for adults with symptomatic, documented gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who fail to respond to conventional therapy and 2) for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis (gastric stasis) in adults.
Metozolv ODT is supplied as tablets designed for oral administration. Metozolv ODT should be taken on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before eating. The recommended initial dose is as follows:
Symptomatic GERD
10 mg to 15 mg up to four times daily (e.g., at least 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime). If symptoms only occur intermittently or at specific times of the day, metoclopramide may be used in single doses up to 20 mg prior to the symptoms rather than continuous treatment. Therapy should not exceed 12 weeks in duration.
Diabetic Gastroparesis
10 mg dose up to four times a day (e.g., at least 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime). Therapy for two to eight weeks is recommended. Therapy should not exceed 12 weeks in duration.
","Side Effects
Treatment with metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia increases with duration of treatment and total cumulative dose. Therefore treatment with metoclopramide for longer than 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia.
Additional adverse events associated with the use of Metozolv ODT may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Nausea
Vomiting
Fatigue
Somnolence
Headache
",,"Mechanism of Action
Metozolv ODT is an orally disintegrating tablet formulation of metoclopramide hydrochloride. Metoclopramide stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. While its mode of action is unclear, it appears to sensitize tissues to the action of acetylcholine. Metoclopramide increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It increases the resting tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. The antiemetic properties of metoclopramide appear to be a result of its antagonism of central and peripheral dopamine receptors. Dopamine produces nausea and vomiting by stimulation of the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and metoclopramide blocks stimulation of the CTZ by agents like l-dopa or apomorphine, which are known to increase dopamine levels or to possess dopamine-like effects. Metoclopramide also abolishes the slowing of gastric emptying caused by apomorphine, induces release of prolactin, and causes a transient increase in circulating aldosterone levels, which may be associated with transient fluid retention.

Diabetic Macular Edema,Eylea (aflibercept),"General Information
Eylea (aflibercept) is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor.
Eylea is specifically indicated for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy of all stages, including in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME).
Eylea is supplied as an intravitreal injection. The recommended dosage of Eylea in patients with diabetic retinopathy is 2 milligrams (mg) every two months (8 weeks) after five initial monthly injections. Although Eylea may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks, additional efficacy was not demonstrated when Eylea was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Eylea for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy in DME was based on two year data from the Phase III VISTA-DME and VIVID-DME studies of 862 patients, which compared Eylea 2 mg monthly, Eylea 2 mg every two months (after five initial monthly injections), or macular laser photocoagulation (at baseline and then as needed). In these studies, on the primary endpoint of mean change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at one year, patients treated with Eylea monthly or every two months showed statistically significant improvements compared to the control group. Patients in both Eylea groups gained, on average, the ability to read approximately two additional lines on an eye chart compared with almost no change in the control group.
The FDA approval of Eylea for diabetic retinopathy was based on six-month and one-year results from PANORAMA, a randomized, multi-center, controlled Phase 3 trial that enrolled 402 patients and was designed to investigate Eylea for the improvement of moderately severe to severe NPDR without diabetic macular edema (DME), compared to sham injection. There were three treatment arms â€“ an observational sham injection group and two Eylea treatment groups. Eylea was dosed every eight weeks (following five initial monthly doses) or every 16 weeks (following three initial monthly doses and one eight-week interval). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced a two-step or greater improvement in the diabetic retinopathy severity scale (DRSS) from baseline for the combined Eylea treatment groups at week 24, and for each Eylea treatment group separately (every eight-week group and every 16-week group) at week 52. The DRSS is a systematic grading scale to assess DR severity based on photographs of the retina.
","Side Effects

Diabetic Macular Edema,Lucentis (ranibizumab injection),"General Information
Lucentis (ranibizumab) is a therapeutic antibody fragment designed to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), a protein that plays a critical role in ocular angiogenesis. Blocking VEGF-A can decrease abnormal new blood vessel formation and the resultant leaking of serum into the retina.
Lucentis is specifically indicated for diabetic macular edema.
Lucentis is supplied as a solution for intravitreal injection. The recommended dose of Lucentis for diabetic macular edema is 0.3 mg (0.05 mL of 6 mg/mL solution) administered once a month (approximately 28 days).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Lucentis for diabetic macular edema was based on two randomized, double-masked, three-year studies, DME1 and DME2. A total of 759 subjects were enrolled and received Lucentis 0.3 mg (n=250); Lucentis 0.5 mg (n=252) or placebo (n=257); 582 (77%) subjects completed through Month 36. The studies were placebo controlled through Month 24. From Months 25 through 36, subjects who previously received placebo were eligible to receive monthly Lucentis 0.5 mg and subjects originally randomized to monthly Lucentis 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg continued to receive their assigned dose. The study was not designed to compare the two doses of Lucentis, but each dose against the control group. Compared to monthly Lucentis 0.3 mg, no additional benefit was observed with monthly treatment with Lucentis 0.5 mg. The data are from the 0.3 mg arm and were measured at Month 24. The results are as follows:
DME1
Gain of >15 letters in visual acuity: Lucentis 34%; placebo 12%
Loss of <15 letters in visual acuity: Lucentis 98%; placebo 92%
Mean change in visual acuity (letters): Lucentis 10.9; placebo 2.3
DME2
Gain of >15 letters in visual acuity: Luncentis 45%; placebo 18%
Loss of <15 letters in visual acuity: Lucentis 98%; placebo 90%
Mean change in visual acuity (letters): Lucentis 12.5; placebo 2.6
Visual acuity outcomes observed at Month 24 in subjects treated with Lucentis 0.3 mg were maintained with continued treatment through Month 36 in both DME studies. Subjects in the placebo arms who received Lucentis 0.5 mg beginning at Month 25 achieved lesser visual acuity gains compared to subjects who began treatment with Lucentis at the beginning of the studies.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Lucentis for diabetic macular edema may include, but are not limited to, the following:
conjunctival hemorrhage

Lucentis (ranibizumab) is a recombinant humanized IgG1 kappa isotype monoclonal antibody fragment designed for intraocular use. Ranibizumab binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). VEGF-A has been shown to cause neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis and vascular occlusion and is thought to contribute to pathophysiology of neovascular AMD, macular edema following RVO, and DME. The binding of ranibizumab to VEGF-A prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation.

Dizzy/Fainting Spells,Northera (droxidopa),"General Information
Northera (droxidopa) is a synthetic amino acid precursor of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine increases blood pressure by inducing peripheral arterial and venous vasoconstriction.
Northera is specifically indicated for the treatment of orthostatic dizziness or lightheadedness in adult patients with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension caused by primary autonomic failure (Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure), dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency, and non-diabetic autonomic neuropathy.
Northera is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended starting dose is 100 mg three times during the day. It may be titrated by 100 mg three times daily, up to a maximum dose of 600 mg three times daily. Northera should be administered consistently with or without food. To reduce the potential for supine hypertension, elevate the head of the bed and give the last dose at least 3 hours prior to bedtime. The effectiveness of Northera beyond 2 weeks is uncertain, and patients should be evaluated periodically to determine whether Northera is continuing to provide a benefit.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Northera was based on short-term (1 to 2 weeks) and longer-term period (8 weeks; 3 months) studies. Thee studies showed a treatment effect of Northera at Week 1, but none of the studies demonstrated continued efficacy beyond two weeks of treatment.
Study 306B
This was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in subjects with symptomatic NOH and Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Subjects entering the study were required to have a decrease of at least 20 mmHg or 10 mmHg, respectively, in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, within 3 minutes after standing, as well as symptoms associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. The study had an initial dose titration period that lasted up to two weeks in which subjects received placebo or 100 to 600 mg of Northera three times daily, followed by an 8-week treatment period. Efficacy was measured using the OHSA Item #1 score (dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, and feeling like you might black out) at Week 1, in subjects who had completed titration and 1 week of maintenance therapy. A total of 171 subjects were enrolled, and 147 were included in the efficacy analysis. In both groups, the mean baseline dizziness score was 5.1 on an 11-point scale. At Week 1, subjects showed a statistically significant mean 0.9-unit decrease in dizziness with Northera versus placebo (p = 0.028), but the effect did not persist beyond Week 1. Subjects receiving Northera also had a greater increase, compared to placebo, in the Week 1 lowest standing systolic blood pressure within 3 minutes after standing (5.6 mmHg; p = 0.032).
Study 301
This multicenter, multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study included an initial open-label dose titration period, a 7-day washout period, and a randomized double-blind 7-day treatment period. To be eligible for enrollment, subjects were required to have a decrease in systolic or diastolic blood pressure of at least 20 or 10 mmHg, respectively, within 3 minutes after standing. The study was enriched, such that only subjects who had been identified as â€˜respondersâ€™ during the titration period were randomized to Northera or placebo. To be considered a responder, a patient had to demonstrate improvement on the OHSA Item #1 score by at least 1 point, as well as an increase in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg post-standing, during the open-label dose titration period. Efficacy was measured using the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ), a patient reported outcome that measures symptoms of NOH and their impact on the patientâ€™s ability to perform daily activities that require standing and walking. The OHQ includes OHSA Item #1 as one of several components. A statistically significant treatment effect was not demonstrated on OHQ (treatment effect of 0.4 unit, p-value=0.19). The mean baseline dizziness score on OHSA Item #1 (dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, and feeling like you might black out) was 5.2 units on an 11-point scale. At Week 1 of treatment, patients showed a mean 0.7 unit decrease in dizziness with Northera versus placebo (p=0.06).
Study 302 was a placebo-controlled 2-week randomized withdrawal study of Northera in 101 subjects with symptomatic NOH. Study 303 was an extension of studies 301 and 302, where 75 subjects received their titrated dose of Northera for 3 months and then entered a 2-week randomized withdrawal phase. Neither study showed a statistically significant difference between treatment arms on its primary endpoint. Considering these data, the effectiveness of Northera beyond 2 weeks is uncertain, and subjects should be evaluated periodically to determine whether Northera is continuing to provide a benefit.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Northera may include, but are not limited to, the following:
headache
dizziness
nausea
hypertension
fatigue
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Northera or neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, please visit the ChelseaTherapeutics web page.","Mechanism of Action
Northera (droxidopa) is a synthetic amino acid analog that is directly metabolized to norepinephrine by dopa-decarboxylase, which is extensively distributed throughout the body. The exact mechanism of action of Northera in the treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is unknown. Northera is believed to exert its pharmacological effects through norepinephrine and not through the parent molecule or other metabolites. Norepinephrine increases blood pressure by inducing peripheral arterial and venous vasoconstriction.

Dravet Syndrome,Diacomit (stiripentol),"General Information
Diacomit (stiripentol) has an unknown mechanism of action but is thought to work through the GABAA receptor.
Diacomit is specifically indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) in patients 2 years of age and older taking clobazam.
Diacomit is supplied both as an oral capsule and as a powder for oral suspension. The recommended oral dosage of Diacomit is 50 mg/kg/day, administered in 2 or 3 divided doses (i.e., 16.67 mg/kg three times daily or 25 mg/kg twice daily). If the exact dosage is not achievable given the available strengths, round to the nearest possible dosage, which is usually within 50 mg to 150 mg of the recommended 50 mg/kg/day. A combination of the two Diacomit strengths can be used to achieve this dosage. The maximum recommended total dosage is 3,000 mg/day. Gradual Withdrawal: If Diacomit treatment is discontinued, the drug should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Diacomit was based on two multicenter placebo-controlled trials, STICLO France and STICLO Italy, which enrolled a combined total of 64 subjects. The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was the responder rate, with a responder defined as a patient who experienced a greater than 50% decrease in the frequency (per 30 days) of generalized clonic or tonic-clonic seizures during the double-blind treatment period compared to the 4-week baseline period. In STICLO France, the responder rate for patients receivingDiacomit was 71%, compared to 5% for patients receiving placebo. In STICLO Italy, the responder rate for patients receiving Diacomit was 67%, compared to 9.1% for patients receiving placebo.

"
Dravet Syndrome,Epidiolex (cannabidiol),"General Information
Epidiolex (cannabidiol) is a pharmaceutical formulation of highly-purified, plant-derived cannabidiol.
Epidiolex is specifically indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) in patients 2 years of age and older.
Epidiolex is supplied as an oral solution. The recommended starting dosage is 2.5 mg/kg twice daily (5 mg/kg/day). After one week, the dosage can be increased to a maintenance dosage of 5 mg/kg twice daily (10 mg/kg/day). Patients who are tolerating Epidiolex at 5 mg/kg twice daily and require further reduction of seizures may benefit from a dosage increase up to a maximum recommended maintenance dosage of 10 mg/kg twice daily (20 mg/kg/day), in weekly increments of 2.5 mg/kg twice daily (5 mg/kg/day), as tolerated. For patients in whom a more rapid titration from 10 mg/kg/day to 20 mg/kg/day is warranted, the dosage may be increased no more frequently than every other day. Administration of the 20 mg/kg/day dosage resulted in somewhat greater reductions in seizure rates than the recommended maintenance dosage of 10 mg/kg/day, but with an increase in adverse reactions.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Lennoxâ€“Gastaut Syndrome: The FDA approval of Epidiolex for the treatment of seizures associated with LGS was established in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients aged 2 to 55 years. Study 1 (N=171) compared a dose of Epidiolex 20 mg/kg/day with placebo. Study 2 (N=225) compared a 10 mg/kg/day dose and a 20 mg/kg/day dose of Epidiolex with placebo. In both studies, patients had a diagnosis of LGS and were inadequately controlled on at least one AED, with or without vagal nerve stimulation and/or ketogenic diet. Both trials had a 4-week baseline period, during which patients were required to have a minimum of 8 drop seizures (â‰¥2 drop seizures per week). The baseline period was followed by a 2-week titration period and a 12-week maintenance period. The primary efficacy measure in both studies was the percent change from baseline in the frequency (per 28 days) of drop seizures (atonic, tonic, or tonic clonic seizures) over the 14-week treatment period. The primary efficacy measure in both studies was the percent change from baseline in the frequency (per 28 days) of drop seizures (atonic, tonic, or tonic clonic seizures) over the 14-week treatment period. In Studies 1 and 2, the median percent change from baseline (reduction) in the frequency of drop seizures was significantly greater for both dosage groups of Epidiolex than for placebo. A reduction in drop seizures was observed within 4 weeks of initiating treatment with Epidiolex, and the effect remained generally consistent over the 14-week treatment period.
Dravat Syndrome: The effectiveness of Epidiolex for the treatment of seizures associated with DS was demonstrated in a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 120 patients aged 2 to 18 years. The study compared a dose of Epidiolex 20 mg/kg/day with placebo. Patients had a diagnosis of treatment-resistant DS and were inadequately controlled with at least one concomitant AED, with or without vagal nerve stimulation or ketogenic diet. During the 4-week baseline period, patients were required to have at least 4 convulsive seizures while on stable AED therapy. The baseline period was followed by a 2-week titration period and a 12-week maintenance period. The primary efficacy measure was the percent change from baseline in the frequency (per 28 days) of convulsive seizures (all countable atonic, tonic, clonic, and tonic-clonic seizures) over the 14-week treatment period. The median percent change from baseline (reduction) in the frequency of convulsive seizures was significantly greater for Epidiolex 20 mg/kg/day than for placebo. A reduction in convulsive seizures was observed within 4 weeks of initiating treatment with Epidiolex and the effect remained generally consistent over the 14-week treatment period.

Duodenal Ulcers,Prilosec (omeprazole)/Biaxin (clarithromycin) Combination Therapy,"General Information
Prilosec in combination with Biaxin has been approved for the treatment of subjects with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer to eradicate H. pylori, the bacteria now believed to cause approximately 90% of peptic ulcers. H. pylori eradication has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Prilosec is marketed by Astra Merck and Biaxin is marketed by Abbott Laboratories.
The recommended dosage for eradicating H. pylori is Prilosec 40 mg once daily and Biaxin 500 mg three times daily for the first 14 days, followed by Prilosec 20 mg once daily for days 15 to 28.
Clinical Results
In clinical trials, the combination of Prilosec and Biaxin had H. pylori eradication rates of up to 83%. Among subjects in whom H. pylori has been eradicated, ulcer recurrence rates have been as low as five percent six months after therapy.
","Side Effects
The Prilosec-Biaxin regimen has been generally well tolerated: side effects, which are usually mild and transient included taste perversion, nausea, and headache.
","Additional Information
Peptic ulcers affect approximately five million Americans each year. It is estimated that 10% of the population will develop an ulcer during their lifetime. In the past, ulcers were believed to be caused by lifestyle factors such as stress and diet. Later, researchers discovered that an imbalance between digestive fluids and the stomach's ability to defend itself against these powerful substances resulted in ulcers.
However, researchers now know that the H. pylori bacteria (along with acid secretion) damages stomach and duodenal tissue, causing inflammation and ulcers in 90% of ulcer subjects. Treatment with Prilosec and Biaxin is considered a dramatic medical advance because elimination of H. pylori means that the ulcer will not only heal but also will not likely return.
H. pylori is a spiral-shaped bacterium found in the stomach. Like most germs, H. pylori bacteria is thought to be transmitted from person-to-person contact. Experts believe the activity of the bacteria damages and weakens the barrier that protects the stomach and duodenum, eventually causing the ulcer. In some people, the infection persists lifelong. Infection with H. pylori has also been linked to a number of other gastrointestinal diseases, including stomach cancer.
An ulcer is a sore or lesion that forms in the lining of the stomach or duodenum where acid and pepsin are present. Symptoms of ulcers include a gnawing or burning pain in the upper abdomen (often occurring between meals and early in the morning), and, sometimes, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and weight. Although ulcers can develop at any age, they are most prevalent in people over the age of 30.
Prilosec is currently indicated as first-line therapy for erosive esophagitis, for the maintenance of healed erosive esophagitis, for symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that is poorly responsive to customary medical treatment, and for short-term treatment of active duodenal ulcer and active benign gastric ulcer. It is also indicated for the treatment of certain pathological hypersecretory conditions. Biaxin is indicated for the treatment of mild-to-moderate infections, including upper-respiratory tract infections, lower-respiratory tract infections, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections.",
Dupuytren's Disease,Xiaflex (collagenase clostridium histolyticum),"General Information
Xiaflex contains purified collagenase clostridium histolyticum. When injected directly into a Dupuytrenâ€™s cord, it enzymatically disrupts collagen. As a result of collagen disruption, contracture may be reduced and range of motion may be improved.
Xiaflex is specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Dupuytrenâ€™s contracture with a palpable cord.
Xiaflex is supplied as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution with the provided diluent. It is injected directly into the Dupuytrenâ€™s cord. The recommended initial dose is 0.58 mg per injection into a palpable cord with a contracture of a metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint or a proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. Approximately 24 hours after injection, a finger extension procedure should be performed if a contracture persists to facilitate cord disruption. Four weeks after the Xiaflex injection and finger extension procedure, if a MP or PIP contracture remains, the cord may be re-injected with a single dose of 0.58 mg of Xiaflex and the finger extension procedure may be repeated (approximately 24 hours after injection). Injections and finger extension procedures may be administered up to 3 times per cord at approximately 4-week intervals.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xiaflex was based on two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centered trials in 374 adults with Dupuytrenâ€™s contracture (Studies 1 and 2). The cord affecting the selected primary joint received up to 3 injections of 0.58 mg of Xiaflex or placebo on Days 0, 30, and 60. About 24 hours after each injection of study medication, if needed, the investigator manipulated (extended) the treated finger in an attempt to facilitate rupture of the cord (finger extension procedure). Following manipulation, patients were fitted with a splint, instructed to wear the splint at bedtime for up to 4 months, and instructed to perform a series of finger flexion and extension exercises each day. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the proportion of patients who achieved a reduction in contracture of the selected primary joint (MP or PIP) to within 0Â° to 5Â° of normal, 30 days after the last injection of that joint on Days 30, 60, or 90 (after up to 3 injections). A greater proportion of Xiaflex-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients achieved the primary endpoint. Following the first injection, the proportion of patients who achieved a contracture reduction of the primary joint to 0Â° to 5Â° was 39% and 1% in Study 1 and 27% and 5% in Study 2 in the Xiaflex and placebo groups respectively. Following up to three injections, the percentage of patients who achieved reduction in contracture of all joints (MP and PIP) to 0Â° to 5Â° was 64% and 7% in Study I and 44% and 5% in Study 2 in the Xiaflex and placebo groups respectively.

Dystonias,Xeomin (incobotulinumtoxinA),"General Information
Xeomin is a Clostridium botulinum type - A neurotoxin complex. Clostridium botulinum toxin type A is a bacterial toxin that prevents nerves from functioning normally (a neurotoxin). It prevents nerves from releasing a chemical called acetylcholine, which is essential for the nerves to communicate with muscle cells. This toxin therefore prevents muscles from receiving nerve stimulation. Botulinum toxin type A causes muscle paralysis until such time as the nerve develops new endings to communicate with the muscles. This it is useful for treating conditions where excessive nerve stimulation to muscles is causing abnormal muscle functioning or spasms.
Xeomin is specifically indicated for adults with cervical dystonia to decrease the severity of abnormal head position and neck pain in both botulinum toxin-naÃ¯ve and previously treated patients and for the treatment of adults with blepharospasm who were previously treated with onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox). Xeomin has also been approved as a first line treatment for blepharospasm and to treat chronic sialorrhea (excessive drooling) in adult patients.
Xeomin is supplied as a solution for intramuscular injection. The recommended initial doses are as follows:
cervical dystonia
120 Units usually injected into the sternocleidomastoid, levator scapulae, splenius capitis, scalenus, and/or the trapezius muscle(s). The dose and number of injection sites in each treated muscle should be individualized based on the number and location of the muscle(s) to be treated, the degree of spasticity/dystonia, muscle mass, body weight, and response to any previous botulinum toxin injections.
blepharospasm
The recommended initial total dose of Xeomin should be the same dose as the patientâ€™s previous treatment of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox). If the previous dose of Botox is not known, the initial dose of Xeomin should be between 1.25-2.5 Units/injection site. The total dose should not exceed 70 Units (35 Units/eye).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xeomin was based on the following studies:
cervical dystonia
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center phase III trial enrolled 233 patients with cervical dystonia. The baseline Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) total score â‰¥20, TWSTRS severity score â‰¥10, TWSTRS disability score â‰¥3, and TWSTRS pain score â‰¥1. The subjects received a single administration of Xeomin 240 Units (n=81), Xeomin 120 Units (n=78), or placebo (n=74). The investigator at each site decided which muscles would receive injections of Xeomin, the number of injection sites, and the volume at each site. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the TWSTRS total score from baseline to Week 4 post-injection. In the ITT population, the difference between the Xeomin 240 Unit group and the placebo group in the change of the TWSTRS total score from baseline to Week 4 was -9.0 points; the difference between the Xeomin 120 Unit group and the placebo group in the change of the TWSTRS total score from baseline to Week 4 was -7.5 points. Both results were statistically significant over placebo (p<0.001).
Blepharospasm
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center phase III trial enrolled 109 patients with blepharospasm. The baseline Jankovic Rating Scale (JRS) Severity subscore â‰¥2, and a stable satisfactory therapeutic response to previous administrations of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox). At least 10 weeks had to have elapsed since the most recent onabotulinumtoxinA administration. The subjects were randomized to receive a single administration of Xeomin or placebo. The Xeomin treatment (dose, volume, dilution, and injection sites per muscle) that was similar to the most recent onabotulinumtoxinA injection sessions prior to study entry. The highest dose permitted in this study was 50 Units per eye; the mean Xeomin dose was 33 Units per eye. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the JRS Severity subscore from baseline to Week 6 post-injection. The difference between the Xeomin arm and the placebo arm in the change of the JRS Severity subscore from baseline to Week 6 was -1.0 (p<0.001).

Xeomin blocks cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine from peripheral cholinergic nerve endings. This inhibition occurs according to the following sequence: neurotoxin binding to cholinergic nerve terminals, internalization of the neurotoxin into the nerve terminal, translocation of the light-chain part of the molecule into the cytosol of the nerve terminal, and enzymatic cleavage of SNAP25, a presynaptic target protein essential for the release of acetylcholine. Impulse transmission is re-established by the formation of new nerve endings.

COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease),Anoro Ellipta (umeclidinium and vilanterol inhalation powder),"General Information
Anoro Ellipta is a combination of umeclidinium, an anticholinergic, and vilanterol, a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).
Anoro Ellipta is specifically indicated for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema.
Anoro Ellipta is supplied as a powder formulation for inhalation. The recommended dose is one inhalation of Anoro Ellipta once daily. Anoro Ellipta should be administered at the same time every day. The dose should not exceed one dose every 24 hours.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Anoro Ellipta was based on the following trials:
Dose-ranging trials
Dose selection for the Anoro Ellipta confirmatory trials was based on dose ranging studies of the individual components: vilanterol and umeclidinium. Based on the findings from these studies, once-daily doses of umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5 mcg/25 mcg and umeclidinium/vilanterol 125mcg/25 mcg were evaluated in the confirmatory COPD trials.
Confirmatory Trials
Two 6-month, active controlled trials enrolled 4,733 subjects, 40 yeasr of age and older, with a history of smoking. Trial 1 evaluated Anoro Ellipta (umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5 mcg/25 mcg), umeclidinium 62.5 mcg, vilanterol 25 mcg, and placebo. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in trough (predose) FEV1 at Day 169 (defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained at 23 and 24 hours after the previous dose on Day 168) compared with placebo, umeclidinium 62.5 mcg, and vilanterol 25 mcg. This was reached; Anoro Ellipta demonstrated a larger increase in mean change from baseline in trough (predose) FEV1 relative to placebo, umeclidinium 62.5 mcg, and vilanterol 25 mcg.

COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease),Arcapta (indacaterol maleate inhalation powder),"General Information
Arcapta contains the active ingredient indacaterol, a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist. When inhaled, indacaterol acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator.
Arcapta is specifically approved for the treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema.
Arcapta is supplied with inhalation powder capsules and an inhaler. The recommended dose is the once-daily inhalation of the contents of one 75 mcg Arcapta capsule using the Neohaler inhaler. Arcapta should be administered once daily every day at the same time of the day by the orally inhaled route only.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Arcpata was based on three dose-ranging trials and six confirmatory trials.
Dose-ranging trials:
Dose selection for Arcapta for COPD was based on three dose-ranging trials: Trial 1, a two-week dose-ranging trial in an asthma population; Trial 2, a two-week dose-ranging trial in a COPD population; and Trial 3, a 26-week adaptive seamless design trial that included an initial two-week dose ranging phase. Although Arcapta is not indicated for asthma, dose selection was primarily based upon the results from the dose-ranging trial in asthma patients (Trial 1) as an asthma population is the most responsive to beta-agonist bronchodilation and is most likely to demonstrate a dose response. Trial 2 and 3 evaluated dose-ranging in COPD patients and provided supportive information.
Dose-Ranging in Asthma
Trial 1 was a two-week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design that enrolled 511 adults with persistent asthma. Trial 1 included Arcapta doses of 18.75, 37.5, 75, and 150 mcg once daily, a salmeterol active control group, and placebo. The trial showed that the effect on FEV1 in subjects treated with Arcapta 18.75 and 37.5 mcg doses was lower compared to subjects treated with other Arcapta doses, particularly after the first dose. The effect did not clearly differ between the 75 and 150 mcg doses.
Dose-ranging in COPD
Trial 2 was a two-week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled design that enrolled 552 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of COPD, who were 40 years or older, had a smoking history of at least 10 pack years. The subjects received Arcapta doses of 18.75, 37.5, 75 and 150 mcg once daily, a salmeterol active control group, and placebo. The effect on FEV1 in subjects treated with Arcapta 18.75 mcg dose was lower compared to subjects treated with other Arcapta doses. Although a dose-response relationship was observed at Day 1, the effect did not clearly differ among the 37.5, 75 and 150 mcg doses by Day 15. Trial 3 evaluated doses of 75, 150, 300, and 600 mcg once daily, placebo, and two active comparators. Although a dose-response relationship was observed at week 2, the effect did not clearly differ among the Arcapta doses.
Confirmatory Trials:
Six confirmatory randomized, double-blinded placebo and active-controlled trials were conducted:
Trial 3 was a 26-week seamless adaptive design trial that included an initial two week dose-ranging phase. The trial evaluated Arcapta doses of 150 mcg and 300 mcg once daily, placebo, and an active comparator;
Trials 4 and 5 were 12-week trials and evaluated Arcapta 75 mcg once daily, and placebo;
Trial 6 was a 12-week trial that evaluated Arcapta 150 mcg once daily and placebo;
Trial 7 was a 26-week trial that evaluated Arcapta 150 mcg once daily, an active comparator, and placebo, and
Trial 8 was a 52 week trial that evaluated Arcapta 300 mcg and 600 mcg once daily, an active comparator, and placebo.
A total of 5,474 subjects were enrolled. All subjects had a clinical diagnosis of COPD, were 40 years or older, had a smoking history of at least 10 pack years, had a post-bronchodilator FEV1 less than 80% and at least 30% of the predicted normal value and a post-bronchodilator ratio of FEV1 over FVC of less than 70%. The primary efficacy endpoint was 24-hour post-dose trough FEV1 after 12 weeks of treatment. In all six confirmatory COPD trials, all doses of Arcapta tested (75 mcg, 150 mcg, 300 mcg, and 600 mcg) showed significantly greater 24-hour post-dose trough FEV1 compared to placebo at 12 weeks. In addition, serial FEV1 measurements in patients treated with Arcapta demonstrated a bronchodilatory treatment effect after the first dose compared to placebo at 5 minutes post dose of 0.09 L (Trial 4) and 0.10 L (Trial 5). The mean peak improvement relative to baseline within the first 4 hours after the first dose (Day 1) was 0.19 L (Trial 4) and 0.22 L (Trial 5) and was 0.24 L (Trial 4) and 0.27 L (Trial 5) after 12 weeks. Improvement in lung function observed at week 4 was consistently maintained over the 12-week treatment period in both trials.

COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease),Breo Ellipta (fluticasone furoate and vilanterol inhalation powder),"General Information
Breo Ellipta is a combination of fluticasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and vilanterol, a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).
BreoEllipta is specifically indicated for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. Breo Ellipta is also indicated to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations.
Breo Ellipta is supplied as a powder for inhalation. The recommended dose is 100 mcg/25 mcg administered as 1 inhalation once daily by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Breo Ellipta should be taken at the same time every day. Do not use more than 1 time every 24 hours.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Breo Ellipta was based on 4 confirmatory trials of 6- and 12-monthsâ€™ duration, three 12-week active comparator trials, and dose-ranging trials of shorter duration.
Dose-Ranging Trials
Vilanterol: Dose selection for vilanterol in COPD was supported by a 28-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial evaluating 5 doses of vilanterol (3 to 50 mcg) or placebo dosed in the morning in 602 patients with COPD. Results demonstrated dose-related increases in FEV1 compared with placebo at Day 1 and Day 28 . These results supported the evaluation of vilanterol 25 mcg in the confirmatory COPD trials. Fluticasone furoate: Eight doses of fluticasone furoate ranging from 25 to 800 mcg once daily were evaluated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week trials in subjects with asthma. A dose-related increase in trough FEV1 at Week 8 was seen for doses from 25 to 200 mcg with no consistent additional benefit for doses above 200 mcg. To evaluate dosing frequency, a separate trial compared fluticasone furoate 200 mcg once-daily, fluticasone furoate 100 mcg twice-daily, fluticasone propionate 100 mcg twice-daily, and fluticasone propionate 200 mcg twice-daily. The results supported the selection of the once-daily dosing frequency. Based on the dose-ranging trials in asthma and COPD, once-daily doses of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50 mcg/25 mcg, 100 mcg/25 mcg, and 200 mcg/25 mcg were evaluated in the confirmatory COPD trials.
Confirmatory Trials
Four confirmatory trials in subjects with COPD were designed to evaluate the efficacy of Breo Ellipta on lung function (Trials 1 and 2) and exacerbations (Trials 3 and 4).
Trials 1 and 2: Lung Function
These 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials enrolled 2,254 subjects. In Trial 1, subjects were randomized to Breo Ellipta 100 mcg/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 200 mcg/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate 100 mcg, fluticasone furoate 200 mcg, vilanterol 25 mcg, and placebo. In Trial 2, subjects were randomized to Breo Ellipta 100 mcg/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50 mcg/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate 100 mcg, vilanterol 25 mcg, and placebo. All treatments were administered as 1 inhalation once daily. The co-primary efficacy variables in both trials were weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours) postdose on Day 168 and change from baseline in trough FEV1 on Day 169 (the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after the final dose on Day 168). Breo Ellipta 100 mcg/25 mcg demonstrated a larger increase in the weighted mean FEV1 (0 to 4 hours) relative to placebo and fluticasone furoate 100 mcg at Day 168. At Day 169, both Trials 1 and 2 demonstrated significant increases in trough FEV1 for all strengths of the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination compared with placebo.

COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease),Daliresp (roflumilast),"General Information
Daliresp (roflumilast) is a selective phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor. Inhibition of PDE4 activity reduces the release of inflammation mediators and can counteract damage to tissue, allowing respiratory muscles to relax and therefore potentially improving lung function.
Daliresp is specifically indicated as a treatment to reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations in patients with severe COPD associated with chronic bronchitis and a history of exacerbations.
Daliresp is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is is one 500 microgram (mcg) tablet per day, with or without food.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Daliresp was based on eight randomized double-blind, controlled, parallel group clinical trials in 9,394 adults. Of the eight trials, two were placebo-controlled dose selection trials (Trials 1 and 2) of 6 months duration that evaluated the efficacy of Daliresp 250 mcg and 500 mcg once daily, four were placebo-controlled 1-year trials (Trials 3, 4, 5, and 6) primarily designed to evaluate the efficacy of Daliresp on COPD exacerbations, and two were 6-month efficacy trials (Trials 7 and 8) which assessed the effect of Daliresp (250 mcg and 500 mcg once daily) as add-on therapy to a long-acting beta agonist or long-acting anti-muscarinic. COPD exacerbations and lung function (FEV1) were co-primary efficacy outcome measures in the four 1-year trials. Lung function (FEV1) alone was the primary efficacy outcome measure In the two 6-month supportive efficacy trials.
Effect on Exacerbations
Trials 3 and 4 failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in the rate of COPD exacerbations. Exploratory analyses of the results of Trials 3 and 4 identified a subpopulation of patients with severe COPD associated with chronic bronchitis and COPD exacerbations within the previous year that appeared to demonstrate a better response in the reduction of the rate of COPD exacerbations compared to the overall population. As a result, two subsequent trials (Trial 5 and Trial 6) were conducted that enrolled patients with severe COPD but associated with chronic bronchitis, at least one COPD exacerbation in the previous year, and at least a 20 pack-year smoking history. In these trials, long-acting beta agonists and short-acting anti-muscarinics were allowed. In both trials, Daliresp 500 mcg once daily demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared to placebo.
Effect on Lung Function
In Trials 3, 4, 5 and 6 Daliresp 500 mcg once daily demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in FEV1 which averaged approximately 50 mL across the four trials.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Daliresp may include, but are not limited to, the following:
diarrhea
weight decrease
nausea
headache
back pain
influenza
insomnia
dizziness

Daliresp (roflumilast) is a selective phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor. Inhibition of PDE4 activity leads to accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP. While the specific mechanism(s) by which Daliresp exerts its therapeutic action in COPD patients is not well defined, it is thought to be related to the effects of increased intracellular cyclic AMP in lung cells.

COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease),Duaklir Pressair (aclidinium bromide and formoterol fumarate),"General Information
Duaklir Pressair is a combination of aclidinium bromide, an anticholinergic, and formoterol fumarate, a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).
Duaklir Pressair is specifically indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Duaklir Pressair is supplied as an inhalation powder, for oral inhalation. The recommended dose of Duaklir Pressair is one oral inhalation of 400 mcg/12 mcg, twice daily (once in the morning and once in the evening). Do not take more than one inhalation twice daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Duaklir Pressiar was based on a clinical development program that included three dose ranging trials, one active and two placebo-controlled lung function trials of 24 weeks duration; and one 28-week long-term safety extension study. The efficacy of Duaklir was primarily based on one dose ranging trial in 128 subjects with COPD and the three 6-month duration confirmatory trials in 5015 subjects with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
Dose-Ranging Trials
Dose selection for Duaklir Pressair for COPD was primarily based on data for the individual components, aclidinium bromide and formoterol fumarate, in COPD patients.
Aclidinium: Dose selection for aclidinium was supported by a 7-day, randomized, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled, crossover trial evaluating 3 doses of aclidinium bromide(400, 200,and 100 mcg) administered twice daily and an active control in 79 subjects with COPD. A dose ordering was observed, with the aclidinium bromide 400 mcg demonstrating larger improvements in FEV1 over 24 hours compared with aclidinium bromide 200 mcg and 100 mcg. The change from baseline in FEV1 AUC0-12 from placebo after 7 days for the 100, 200, and 400 mcg doses were 154 mL, 176 mL and 208 mL, respectively. The results supported the selection of 400 mcg of aclidinium bromide twice daily in the confirmatory COPD trials.
Formoterol: Dose selection for formoterol was supported by a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active comparator (open-label) controlled, 5-period incomplete unbalanced crossover trial evaluating 3 doses of formoterol fumarate (24, 12, and 6 mcg) administered twice daily and an open-label active comparator in 132 subjects with COPD. The change from baseline in FEV1 AUC0-12 from placebo after 7 days for the 6, 12, and 24 mcg doses were 108 mL, 117 mL, and 162 mL, respectively. The results supported the evaluation of 12 mcg of formoterol twice daily in the confirmatory COPD trials.
Confirmatory Trials
The clinical development program for Duaklir Pressair included two placebo-controlled (Trial 1) and Trial 2 and one active-controlled (Trial 3) randomized, double-blind, parallel-group 24-week trials in subjects with moderate to very severe COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, designed to evaluate the efficacy of Duaklir Pressair on lung function. The 24-week trials included 4,977 subjects >40 years of age that had a clinical diagnosis of COPD, with a smoking history greater than or equal to 10 pack-years, a post-albuterol FEV1 less than 80% of predicted normal values, and a ratio of FEV1/FVC of less than 0.7. The majority of these patients were male (61%) and Caucasian (94%) with a mean age of 64 years and an average smoking history of 46 pack-years (50% current smokers). Trials 1, 2, and 3 evaluated Duaklir Pressair (aclidinium/formoterol fumarate) 400 mcg/12 mcg, aclidinium 400 mcg, and formoterol fumarate 12 mcg. Trials 1 and 2 included a placebo arm, and Trial 3 included an active, blinded, control arm.
The co-primary endpoints were change from baseline in trough FEV1 and change from baseline in one-hour post-dose FEV1 at Week 24 compared with formoterol fumarate 12 mcg and aclidinium 400 mcg, respectively. In the three trials, Duaklir Pressair demonstrated a statistically significant increase in mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 and change from baseline in one-hour post-dose FEV1 at Week 24 relative to formoterol fumarate 12mcg and aclidinium 400 mcg, respectively.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Duaklir Pressair or COPD, please visit https://www.duaklir.com/","Mechanism of Action
Duaklir Pressair is a combination of aclidinium bromide, an anticholinergic, and formoterol fumarate, a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).
Aclidinium bromide is a long-acting antimuscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. The bronchodilation following inhalation of aclidinium bromide is predominantly a site-specific effect.

COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease),DuoNeb (albuterol sulfate and ipratropium bromide),"General Information
DuoNeb Inhalation Solution has been approved for the treatment of bronchospasm associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients who require more than one bronchodilator. This product combines two respiratory solutions, ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate, in a premixed, premeasured, unit-dose vial for nebulization. With this formulation, there is no need for patients to dilute or mix solutions, and advantages may include faster treatment time and a reduced chance of medication error.
COPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis -- diseases that are characterized by airflow obstruction. According to the World Health Organization, COPD will be the third most common cause of death worldwide by 2020. The quality of life for a person suffering from COPD diminishes as the disease progresses. Current treatment is tailored to the severity of the disease and may include bronchodilators, antibiotics and exercise to strengthen muscles.
Clinical Results
Results of an 863-subject trial demonstrated that DuoNeb improved bronchodilation over albuterol alone by 24% and over ipratropium alone by 37%, with no increased safety risk.
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions reported with DuoNeb include (but are not limited to) the following:
Chest pain
Pharyngitis
Diarrhea
Bronchitis
Nausea
Leg cramps
Caution is advised for patients with the following conditions:
Convulsive disorders
Hyperthyroidism
Diabetes Mellitus
Narrow-angle glaucoma
Prostatic hypertrophy
Bladder-neck obstruction
Albuterol sulfate administration, as well as the co-administration of DuoNeb and other sympathomimetic agents, may result in significant cardiovascular effects.

COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease),Foradil Aerolizer (formoterol fumarate inhalation powder),"General Information
Foradil is a bronchodilator that belongs to the long-acting beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist class of compounds. Novartis' Foradil Aerolizer was approved in February 2001 for the maintenance treatment of asthma and the prevention of bronchospasm in reversible obstructive airways disease. Foradil is also indicated for the acute prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB), when administered on an occasional, as needed basis.
In September 2001, a second FDA approval was obtained - the Foradil Aerolizer can now be used for long term administration in the maintenance treatment of bronchoconstriction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
Foradil is administered via a dry powder inhaler called the Aerolizer, which unlike traditional metered-dose inhalers, provides patients with the reassurance that they are in control of dosing. The Aerolizer offers patients little resistance to inhalation, and produces a whirring noise which signals that the drug is being inhaled. Patients can taste the powder and then open the device to check that they have inhaled all of the dose.
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that affects 15 million Americans. According to the World Health Organization, each year 180,000 people die from asthma worldwide. The disease is characterized by shortness of breath, wheezing, tightness in the chest, and a cough that lasts more than a week.
COPD is a common chronic lung disease and a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with 2.25 million deaths a year. By 2025, the World Health Organization estimates that COPD will be the third leading cause of death globally. Since both asthma and COPD are chronic conditions, the goal of treatment is management and improvement of quality of life, rather than cure.
Clinical Results
The effectiveness of Foradil as a treatment for asthma was evaluated in five key trials involving more than 7,000 subjects, including over 1,600 mild to moderate asthmatics. In these placebo-controlled trials, Foradil was administered in 12 and 24 mcg twice daily doses.
Overall, these studies demonstrated both dosages of Foradil to be significantly better than placebo at improving lung function and quality of life in asthmatic subjects. Foradil provided subjects with clinically significant bronchodilation for a 12 hour period.
Clinical trials were also conducted to compare Foradil to the compound ipratropium bromide in subjects with COPD. Results showed that Foradil was significantly superior at reducing clinical symptoms and improving quality of life scores.
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions to treatment with Foradil are similar to those observed with other selective beta2-adrenoceptor agonists. These effects can include (but are not limited to) the following:
Angina
Muscle cramps
Rapid or irregular heartbeat
Nervousness
Headache
Tremor
Dizziness
","Additional Information
For additional information on Foradil, please visit Novartis or the product web site at www.foradil.com.","Mechanism of Action
Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (beta2-agonist). Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator.
The pharmacologic effects of beta2 adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.

COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease),Incruse Ellipta (umeclidinium inhalation powder),"General Information
Incruse Ellipta (umeclidinium inhalation powder) is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) monotherapy, a type of bronchodilator also known as a long-acting anticholinergic.
Incruse Ellipta is specifically indicated for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema.
Incruse Ellipta is supplied as a powder for inhalation via a plastic inhaler. The recommended dose is 1 inhalation once daily by the orally inhaled route only. It should be taken at the same time every day. Do not use Incruse Ellipta more than 1 time every 24 hours.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Incruse Ellipta was based on dose-ranging trials in 624 subjects with COPD and two placebo-controlled confirmatory trials in 1,738 subjects with COPD.
Dose-ranging trials
Dose selection for umeclidinium in COPD was supported by a 7-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial evaluating 4 doses of umeclidinium (15.6 to 125 mcg) or placebo dosed once daily in the morning in subjects with COPD. A dose ordering was observed, with the 62.5- and 125-mcg doses demonstrating larger improvements in FEV1 over 24 hours compared with the lower doses of 15.6 and 31.25 mcg. The differences in trough FEV1 from baseline after 7 days for placebo and the 15.6-, 31.25-, 62.5-, and 125-mcg doses were -74 mL, 38 mL, 27 mL, 49 mL and 109 mL respectively. Two additional dose-ranging trials in subjects with COPD demonstrated minimal additional benefit at doses above 125 mcg. The dose-ranging results supported the evaluation of 2 doses of umeclidinium, 62.5 and 125 mcg, in the confirmatory COPD trials to further assess dose response.
Confirmatory Trials
Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Incruse Ellipta on lung function. Trial I was a 24-week placebo controlled trial and Trial 2 was a 12-week placebo controlled trial. Trial 1 evaluated umeclidinium 62.5 mcg and placebo. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in trough (predose) FEV1 at Day 169 (defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained at 23 and 24 hours after the previous dose on Day 168) compared with placebo. Incruse Ellipta 62.5 mcg demonstrated a larger increase in mean change from baseline in trough (predose) FEV1 relative to placebo. In Trial 1, the mean peak FEV1 (over the first 6 hours relative to baseline) at Day 1 and at Day 168 for the group receiving umeclidinium 62.5 mcg compared with placebo was 126 and 130 mL, respectively. Similar results were obtained in Trial 2.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Incruse Ellipta may include, but are not limited to, the following:
nasopharyngitis
upper respiratory tract infection
cough
arthralgia
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Incruse Ellipta or COPD, please visit the GSK web page.","Mechanism of Action
Incruse Ellipta (umeclidinium) is a long-acting, antimuscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through the inhibition of M3 receptor at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of methacholine and acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstrictive effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The bronchodilation following inhalation of umeclidinium is predominantly a site-specific effect.

Cancer Pain,Abstral (fentanyl sublingual tablets),"General Information
Abstral is a sublingual tablet formulation of fentanyl citrate, a potent opioid analgesic. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown.
Abstral is specifically indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving, and who are tolerant to, opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain.
Abstral is supplied as a sublingual tablet designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is a single 100 mcg tablet. If adequate analgesia is obtained within 30 minutes of administration of the 100 mcg tablet, continue to treat subsequent episodes of breakthrough pain with this dose. If adequate analgesia is not obtained after the initial dose, the patient may use a second Abstral dose (after 30 minutes) as directed by their health care provider. No more than two doses of Abstral may be used to treat an episode of breakthrough pain. Patients must wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough pain. The Abstral dose should be escalated in a stepwise manner, increased by 100 mcg multiples up to 400 mcg, over consecutive breakthrough episodes until adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects is achieved.
Clinical Results
FDA Approvals
The FDA approval of Abstral was based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 131 subjects experiencing breakthrough cancer pain. Breakthrough cancer pain was defined as a transient flare of moderate-to-severe pain occurring in patients experiencing persistent cancer pain otherwise controlled with maintenance doses of opioid medications. Of the 131 subjects who entered the titration phase of the study, 78 (60%) achieved a successful dose during the titration phase. Sixty-six patients entered the double-blind phase and 60 completed the study. The primary outcome measure, the mean sum of pain intensity difference at 30 minutes (SPID30) for Abstral-treated episodes was statistically significantly higher than for placebo-treated episodes. In a second open-label safety study using an identical titration regimen, 96 of 139 patients (69%) who entered the study titrated to a dose in which the patient obtained adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects during the titration phase.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Abstral may include, but are not limited to, the following:
nausea

Cancer Pain,Lazanda (fentanyl citrate) nasal spray,"General Information
Lazanda is a nasal spray formulation of fentanyl citrate, a highly effective opiate analgesic that has been shown to provide rapid onset and short duration of action.
Lazanda is specifically indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. Lazanda is contraindicated for patients who are not already tolerant to opioids because life-threatening respiratory depression and death could occur in patients not taking chronic opioids. For this reason, Lazanda is contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain, including headache/migraine, dental pain, or use in the emergency department.
Lazanda is supplied as a solution for intranasal administration. The appropriate dose of Lazanda must be determined by dose titration and is based on the individual patientâ€™s effective and tolerable dose.
Starting Dose: Individually titrate Lazanda to a dose that provides adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects. Begin treatment of all patients (including those switching from another fentanyl product) using ONE 100 mcg spray of Lazanda (1 spray in one nostril). If adequate analgesia is obtained within 30 minutes of administration of the 100 mcg single spray, treat subsequent episodes of breakthrough pain with this dose.
Titration steps: If adequate analgesia is not achieved with the first 100 mcg, dose, dose escalate in a step-wise manner over consecutive episodes of breakthrough pain until adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects is achieved. Patients must wait at least two hours before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain with Lazanda.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Lazanda was based on a clinical trial consisting of an open-label titration phase and a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase. In the open label phase a dose was identified that provided adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects, within the range of 100 to 800 mcg. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, the subjects who were titrated to an adequate dose were randomized to a blinded sequence of 10 treatments, seven treatments with the identified dose of Lazanda and three with placebo. Of the subjects who enrolled in the study, 73% achieved an adequate dose during the titration phase. The primary outcome measure, the mean sum of the pain intensity difference at 30 minutes (SPID30), was statistically significantly higher for Lazanda than for placebo. This improvement in pain was maintained for 60 minutes after dosing.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Lazanda during the titration phase may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Cancer Pain,Onsolis (fentanyl buccal),"General Information
Onsolis is an oral transmucosal form of the potent opioid analgesic, fentanyl citrate, a pure opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown although fentanyl is known to be a mu-opioid receptor agonist. Specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.
Onsolis is specifically indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer, 18 years of age and older, who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. This product must not be used in opioid non-tolerant patients.
Onsolis is supplied as a film (200,,400, 600, 800 or 1200 mcg) intended for application to the buccal mucosa (cheek). It utilizes the BioErodible MucoAdhesive (BEMA) bilayer delivery technology which is comprised of water-soluble polymeric films. Onsolis must be individually dose titrated to determine the most effective and tolerable dose.
Starting Dose:
All patients MUST begin treatment using one 200 mcg Onsolis film. Patients switching from another oral transmucosal fentanyl product must be started on no greater than 200 mcg.
If adequate pain relief is not achieved after one 200 mcg film, titrate using multiples of the 200 mcg film until the patient reaches a dose that provides adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects. Do not use more than four of the 200 mcg Onsolis films simultaneously.
If adequate pain relief is not achieved after 800 mcg Onsolis (i.e., four 200 mcg films), and the patient has tolerated the 800 mcg dose, treat the next episode by using one 1200 mcg film. Doses above 1200 mcg Onsolis should not be used.
Single doses should be separated by at least 2 hours. Onsolis should only be used once per breakthrough cancer pain episode (it should not be redosed within an episode).
During any episode of breakthrough cancer pain, if adequate pain relief is not achieved after Onsolis, rescue medication may be used after 30 minutes as directed by a healthcare provider.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Onsolis was based on the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The trial enrolled opioid tolerant adult patients experiencing breakthrough cancer pain but otherwise controlled with maintenance doses of opioid medications. Open-label titration identified a successful dose of Onsolis (adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects), within the range of 200 to 1200 mcg. The primary outcome measure, the mean sum of pain intensity differences at 30 minutes (SPID30) for Onsolis-treated episodes was statistically significantly higher than for placebo-treated episodes.

Cancer Pain,Quadramet (Samarium Sm 153 Lexidronam Injection),"General Information
Quadramet (Samarium Sm 153 Lexidronam Injection) has been approved to treat the severe pain associated with cancers that have spread to bone. It is indicated for relief of pain in patients with confirmed osteoblastic metastatic bone lesions that enhance on radionuclide bone scan.
This condition is most often experienced by patients with prostate, breast or lung cancers that have spread to the bone. Quadramet is a radiopharmaceutical that may be administered as a single intravenous injection on an outpatient basis.
",,"Additional Information
Estimates, including those from the American Cancer Society and National Cancer Institute, show that over 200,000 patients annually in the United States will experience severe, chronic pain associated with bone metastases.","Mechanism of Action
Clinical studies show that Quadramet targets the sites of new bone formation, concentrating in regions of the bone that have been invaded with metastatic tumor. The drug goes to the source of cancer bone pain and irradiates the osteoblastic tumor sites resulting in relief of pain. The onset of pain relief was experienced as early as one week in the majority of patients.

Cancer Pain,Subsys (fentanyl sublingual spray),"General Information
Subsys is a sublingual spray formulation of fentanyl. Fentanyl is an opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown although fentanyl is known to be a mu-opioid receptor agonist.
Subsys was specifically approved for the management of breakthrough pain in adult cancer patients who are already receiving and who are tolerant to around-the-clock opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain.
Susbsys is supplied as a spray for sublingual administration. Subsys should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes side effects. The initial dose of Subsys to treat episodes of breakthrough cancer pain is always 100 mcg. From this initial dose, the dose should be titrated to provide adequate analgesia using a single Subsys dose per breakthrough cancer pain episode with tolerable side effects. For each breakthrough pain episode treated, if pain is not relieved after 30 minutes, patients may take ONLY ONE additional dose of the same strength for that episode. Thus the maximum of two doses of Subsys is recommended for any breakthrough pain episode. Patients MUST wait at least 4 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough pain with Subsys.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Subsys was based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in opioid tolerant adults with cancer and breakthrough pain. The subjects received Subsys from 100 mcg per dose to 1600 mcg per dose. The study began with an open-label dose titration period followed by a double-blind treatment period. The goal of titration was to find the dose of Subsys that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects. Once a successful dose was established, subjects were enrolled into the double-blind period and randomized to a sequence of 10 treatments; 7 with Subsys and 3 with placebo. The subjects assessed pain intensity on a 100 mm visual analog scale that rated the pain as 0=none to 100=worst possible pain. With each episode of breakthrough pain, pain intensity was assessed first and then treatment was administered. Pain intensity (0-100) was then measured at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after the start of administration. The primary endpoint was the summed pain intensity difference from baseline to 30 minutes after dosing. Out of 130 subjects who entered the titration phase, 98 (75%) were able to titrate to a dose that adequately reduced pain with tolerable side effects and entered into the double-blind period. Subsys produced a statistically significantly greater reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo as measured by the Summed Pain Intensity Differences scale (SPID) at 30 minutes.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Subsys may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Cancer Prevention,"Cervarix [Human Papillomavirus Bivalent (Types 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant","General Information
Cervarix is a virus-like particle combination vaccine consisting of self-assembling, virus-like particles based on HPV-16 and HPV-18. It was designed to elicit an immune response against the human papilloma virus (HPV).
Cervarix is specifically indicated for the prevention of the following diseases caused by oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18: cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or worse and adenocarcinoma in situ and CI) grade 1 in females 10 through 25 years of age.
Cervarix is supplied as a suspension for intramuscular injection. The recommended administration is 3 doses of 0.5-mL each, by intramuscular injection at 0, 1, and 6 months.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Cervarix was based on two double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical studies that enrolled a total of 19,778 females 15 through 25 years of age.
Study One (HPV001)
This study enrolled women who were negative for oncogenic HPV DNA in cervical samples, seronegative for HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies and had normal cytology. This population was presumed ""naÃ¯ve"" without current HPV infection at the time of vaccination and without prior exposure to either HPV-16 or HPV-18. Twelve-month persistent infection was evaluated as an efficacy endpoint. There were five cases of 12-month persistent HPV-16/18 infection (4 HPV-16; 1 HPV-18) in the control group and one HPV-16 case in the vaccine group in study 001.
Study Two (HPV008)
In this study women were vaccinated regardless of baseline HPV DNA status, serostatus or cytology. This population was naÃ¯ve (without current infection and without prior exposure) or non-naÃ¯ve (with current infection and/or with prior exposure) to HPV. Cervarix provided a high and statistically significant level of efficacy against pre-cancerous lesions associated with each of the HPV types included in the vaccine (HPV 16 and HPV 18). In addition, the data demonstrated that the vaccine also provided type-specific protection against pre-cancerous lesions associated with some additional common cancer-causing HPV types other than HPV 16 and HPV 18. In women without evidence of prior cancer-causing HPV infection the overall efficacy demonstrated against any lesion, regardless of HPV type, was much greater than would be expected for a vaccine targeting only HPV types 16 and 18.
Study 1 and Study 1 Extension
In Study 1 and Study 1 Extension, with up to 6.4 years of follow-up (mean 5.9 years), in naÃ¯ve females 15 through 25 years of age, efficacy against CIN2/3 or AIS associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18 was 100%. Efficacy against 12-month persistent infection with HPV-16 or HPV-18 was 100%.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use if Cervarix may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Pain
Redness
Swelling at the injection site
Fatigue
Headache
Myalgia
Gastrointestinal symptoms
Arthralgia
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Cervarix or the prevention of cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia caused by HPV types 16 and 18, please visit the Cervarix web page.","Mechanism of Action
Cervarix is a non-infectious recombinant, AS04-adjuvanted vaccine that contains recombinant L1 protein, the major antigenic protein of the capsid, of oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18. It is thought that the efficacy of the vaccine may be mediated by the development of IgG neutralizing antibodies directed against HPV-L1 capsid proteins generated as a result of vaccination.

The medical device, consisting of a silicon-filled flexible circular plastic envelope 10 inches in diameter, is designed to reduce friction while women examine their breasts.
Clinical Results
Last month, the FDA received the results of a clinical study conducted in Japan. The study found that women who were trained in using the pad detected their own breast lumps almost as frequently as they were found by trained nurses also using the pad.
",,"Additional Information
The pad is to be distributed only by health care providers and only to women who have received instructions in its proper use. The FDA announcement said that women should continue bare-handed breast self-examinations and maintain a schedule of regular breast examinations by a physician and annual mammograms.
Monthly breast self-examination (BSE) is recommended by cancer authorities as a routine good health habit for women 20 and older. Upwards of 75% of breast lumps subsequently diagnosed as cancer are first discovered by the woman herself.
Mammography is also recommended for breast cancer screening. A ""baseline"" mammogram is recommended for women between 35 and 39, and this initial screening can be compared against later mammograms as a further check. Women between 40 and 49 are advised to have a mammogram every 1 to 2 years, and women aged 50 and over, yearly.",

Vorapaxar does not inhibit platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen or a thromboxane mimetic and does not affect coagulation parameters ex vivo. PAR-1 receptors are also expressed in a wide variety of cell types, including endothelial cells, neurons, and smooth muscle cells, but the pharmacodynamic effects of vorapaxar in these cell types have not been assessed.

Cardiology/Vascular Diseases,Adcirca (tadalafil),"General Information
Adcirca (tadalafil) is an oral inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Pulmonary hypertension is the result of upregulation of PDE5 gene expression, causing vasoconstriction in the lung. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases the concentrations of cGMP resulting in elaxation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed.
Adcirca is specifically indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I) to improve exercise ability.
Adcirca is supplied as a 20 mg tablet for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 40 mg (two 20 mg tablets) taken once daily with or without food. Dividing the dose (40 mg) over the course of the day is not recommended.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Adcirca for pulmonary hypertension was based on a randomized, double-blind, 16 week placebo-controlled study in 405 subjects (mean age 54 years), 341 of whom completed the study. The subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment groups (tadalafil 2.5, 10, 20, 40 mg, or placebo). The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at week 16 in 6-MWD. The mean baseline 6-minute walk distance (6-MWD) was 343 meters. In the Adcirca 40 mg treatment group, the placebo-adjusted mean change increase in 6-MWD was 33 meters (p=0.0004). The improvement in 6-MWD was apparent at 8 weeks of treatment and then maintained at week 12 and week 16. There was less clinical worsening (defined as death, lung transplantation, atrial septostomy, hospitalization because of worsening PAH, initiation of new PAH therapy or worsening WHO functional class) in the Adcirca 40 mg group compared to the placebo group and the groups that used lower doses of Adcirca.
Long-term treatment
A long-term extension study was conducted in 357 subjects from the placebo-controlled study. Of these, 311 subjects were treated with tadalafil for at least 6 months and 182 for 1 year (median exposure 356 days; range 2 days to 415 days). The survival rate in the extension study was 96.5 per 100 patient years.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Adcirca may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Headache
Dyspepsia
Myalgia
Nausea
Back Pain
Nasopharyngitis
Flushing
Respiratory Tract Infection
Pain in Extremity
Adverse reactions identified during post-approval use of tadalafil:
Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events
Hypersensitivity reactions
Nervous system reactions
Ophthalmologic reactions
Otologic reactions
","Additional Information

Adcirca (tadalafil) is an oral inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with impaired release of nitric oxide by the vascular endothelium and consequent reduction of cGMP concentrations in the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle. PDE5 is the predominant phosphodiesterase in the pulmonary vasculature. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases the concentrations of cGMP resulting in elaxation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed.

Cardiology/Vascular Diseases,Adempas (riociguat),"General Information
Adempas (riociguat) is a stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), an enzyme in the cardiopulmonary system and the receptor for nitric oxide (NO). These stimulators help arteries relax to increase blood flow and decrease blood pressure.
Adempas is specifically indicated for persistent/recurrent Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH) (WHO Group 4) after surgical treatment or inoperable CTEPH to improve exercise capacity and WHO functional class and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise capacity, improve WHO functional class and to delay clinical worsening.
Adempas is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is 1 mg taken three times a day. For patients who may not tolerate the hypotensive effect of Adempas, consider a starting dose of 0.5 mg, three times a day. The dose may be increased by 0.5 mg at intervals of no sooner than 2-weeks as tolerated to a maximum of 2.5 mg three times a day.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Adempas was based on CHEST-1 for CTEPH and PATENT-1 for PAH.
CHEST-1
This multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 261 subjects with inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The subjects were randomized to either riociguat or placebo orally for 16 weeks. Riociguat was titrated, over a period of eight weeks in doses of 0.5 mg increments, from 1.0 mg up to 2.5 mg, three times a day. After the titration phase, subjects were followed up for another eight weeks on their last dose. The study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the six-minute walk distance (6MWD); subjects treated with riociguat showed an improvement of 46 meters (p<0.0001) compared to those treated with placebo. Riociguat also showed statistically significant improvements in secondary endpoints including pulmonary vascular resistance (p<0.0001), N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (p<0.0001) and WHO functional class (p=0.0026).

Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension sGC Stimulator Trial. This multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 445 subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension who were either treatment-naÃ¯ve or being treated with an endothelin receptor antagonist or a prostacyclin analog. The subjects were randomized to receive either placebo or two different doses of riociguat orally over a period of 12 weeks. The riociguat dose was titrated over a period of eight weeks in doses of 0.5 mg increments, from 1.0 mg up to 2.5 mg three times daily. Subjects were then followed for an additional four weeks. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the six-minute walking distance test after 12 weeks of treatment. A statistically significant improvement was demonstrated for the primary endpoint; subjects treated with riociguat showed an improvement of 36 meters (p<0.0001) after 12 weeks compared with placebo.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Adempas or CTEPH or PAH, please visit the Bayer Healthcare web page.","Mechanism of Action
Adempas (riociguat) is a stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), an enzyme in the cardiopulmonary system and the receptor for nitric oxide (NO). When NO binds to sGC, the enzyme catalyzes synthesis of the signaling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Intracellular cGMP plays an important role in regulating processes that influence vascular tone, proliferation, fibrosis and inflammation. Pulmonary hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction, impaired synthesis of nitric oxide and insufficient stimulation of the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway. Riociguat has a dual mode of action. It sensitizes sGC to endogenous NO by stabilizing the NO-sGC binding. Riociguat also directly stimulates sGC via a different binding site, independently of NO. Riociguat stimulates the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway and leads to increased generation of cGMP with subsequent vasodilation.

Cardiology/Vascular Diseases,Advicor (extended-release niacin/lovastatin),"General Information
Advicor is a combination product containing both extended-release niacin and lovastatin. This drug has been approved for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. It is indicated for patients who were previously treated with either component of Advicor, but who require additional lipid modification for LDL or HDL cholesterol and triglycerides.
Advicor tablets are available in three different combinations of extended-release niacin and lovastatin. The different strengths combine either 500mg, 750mg or 1000 mg of extended-release niacin with 20mg of lovastatin.
Clinical Results
Results of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial in subjects with type IIa and IIb hyperlipidemia supported the approval of Advicor. In this trial, Advicor was compared to monotherapy with Niaspan (extended-release niacin) or lovastatin. Dosage was escalated throughout the trial, with patients receiving each dose for at least four weeks. Subjects in the Advicor group received strengths ranging from 500mg/20mg to 2000mg/40mg. Those in the Niaspan monotherapy group received a similar titration from 500 mg to 2000 mg, and subjects in the lovastatin monotherapy group received 20mg titrated up to 40mg.
Results showed that Advicor decreased LDL-C, triglycerides (TG) and lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), and increased HDL-C, in a dose-dependent fashion.
Advicor produced greater LDL-lowering than lovastatin 40mg after 28 weeks of titration to a dose of 2000mg/40mg. Advicor also produced greater LDL-lowering than Niaspan at doses of 1000mg/20mg or higher. In terms of HDL, Advicor was superior in raising HDL compared to lovastatin and Niaspan monotherapy at all doses. Additionally, Advicor was more effective in lowering TG at doses of 1000 mg/20 mg or greater compared to lovastatin and Niaspan monotherapy.

Amturnide is a single tablet combining the direct renin inhibitor Tekturna (aliskiren), with the widely used calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ).
Amturnide is specifically indicated for the treatment of hypertension in patients not adequately controlled with any two of the following: aliskiren, dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (DHP-CCB), and thiazide diuretics.
Amturnide is supplied as a tablet designed for oral administration. Amturnide is supplied as once-daily tablets containing aliskiren, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide: 150 mg/5 mg/12.5 mg tablets, 300 mg/5 mg/12.5 mg tablets, 300 mg/5 mg/25 mg tablets, 300 mg/10 mg/12.5 mg tablets, and 300 mg/10 mg/25 mg tablets.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Amturnide was based on a double-blind, active controlled study in 1,181 patients with moderately elevated blood pressure (mean systolic blood pressure [mSBP] 160-179 mmHg) or severely elevated blood pressure (mSBP >/=180 mmHg). The subjects received Amturnide or dual combination treatment of aliskiren/amlodipine 300 mg/10 mg, aliskiren/HCTZ 300 mg/25 mg, and amlodipine/HCTZ 10 mg/25 mg. Both patient populations achieved greater systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions with Amturnide compared to the dual combinations. In the overall patient population, Amturnide reduced systolic/diastolic blood pressure by an additional 9.9/6.3 mmHg compared to aliskiren/HCTZ; 7.2/3.6 mmHg compared to amlodipine/HCTZ; and 6.6/2.6 mmHg compared to aliskiren/amlodipine. In patients with severely elevated blood pressure, these reductions were greater by 16.3/8.2 mmHg, 9.6/4.8 mmHg, and 11.4/4.9 mmHg respectively.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Amturnide may include, but are not limited to, the following:
swelling of ankles, feet and hands

Amturnide is a single tablet combining the direct renin inhibitor Tekturna (aliskiren), with the widely used calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The aliskiren component targets the activity of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, an important regulator of blood pressure. Aliskiren directly binds to and inhibits renin, an enzyme produced by the kidneys that starts a process that can make blood vessels narrow and lead to high blood pressure. The calcium channel blocker amlodipine lowers blood pressure by relaxing muscles in the blood vessel walls, and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide increases the excretion of sodium chloride and water. All three complementary medicines work to relax blood vessels and reduce blood volume, therefore lowering blood pressure.

Symptoms of the disorder include sexual dysfunction (loss of libido or impotence), fatigue, depressed mood, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, or absence or regression of secondary male sexual characteristics (muscle development, deep voice, or hair distribution).",
Cardiology/Vascular Diseases,Angiomax (bivalirudin),"General Information
Angiomax (bivalirudin) is indicated as a thrombin-specific anticoagulant to be used in conjunction with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). It is available by prescription only in a 250mg injectable formulation. The drug has been studied only in patients receiving concomitant aspirin.
Clinical Results
Double-blinded clinical trials involving 4,312 patients undergoing PTCA for new onset angina, accelerating episodes of angina, or angina at rest were conducted to test the effectiveness and safety of the product in clinical outcomes compared to heparin. The data demonstrated significant improvement compared to heparinâ€”the current standard anticoagulant used in PTCA.
The FDA approved product labeling includes clinical data showing a 22% reduction in the risk of death, myocardial infarction (MI) or revascularization for ANGIOMAX-treated patients (6.2%) compared with heparin-treated patients (7.9%). The difference was sustained at 90-days and 6-months. In the same trial data, Angiomax also demonstrated a 62% reduction in the incidence of major hemorrhage for ANGIOMAX-treated patients (3.5%) compared to heparin-treated patients (9.3%). These significantly lower incidence rates of clinically important events following angioplasty translated into 68 fewer patients experiencing adverse and costly outcomes for every 1,000 patients treated. (From Company Press Release)
","Side Effects
Angiomax is contraindicated in patients with active major bleeding or hypersensitivity to the drug or its components. Angiomax is not intended for intramuscular administration. Although most bleeding associated with the use of Angiomax in PTCA occurs at the site of arterial puncture, hemorrhage can occur at any site.
The safety and effectiveness of ANGIOMAX have not been established in patients with unstable angina who are not undergoing PTCA or in patients with other acute coronary syndromes. Additionally, the safety and effectiveness of ANGIOMAX have not been established when used in conjunction with platelet inhibitors other than aspirin, such as glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa inhibitors. However, drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with the ADP antagonist, ticlopidine, and the GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor, abciximab, and with low molecular weight heparin. Although data are limited, thus precluding conclusions regarding efficacy and safety in combination with these agents, the results show no evidence of pharmacodynamic interactions.

Cardiology/Vascular Diseases,Argatroban Injection,"General Information
Heparin is the most commonly used anticoagulant for patients requiring immediate anticoagulation therapy. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has an immunologic basis and is commonly associated with venous thrombosis. The availability of direct thrombin inhibitors has assisted physicians in managing this disorder.
HIT is an immunoglobulin-mediated adverse drug reaction that is characterized by platelet activation, thrombocytopenia, and a high risk of thrombotic complications among patients receiving or who have recently received heparin. HIT is one of the most important immunologic drug reactions.
Thrombocytopenia is usually mild to moderate, with platelet counts ranging from 20 to 150 x 109/L. Similarly, a fall in platelet count of 50% or more that begins later than 5 days after the start of heparin therapy, but with the platelet count still above the usual threshold for thrombocytopenia (150 x 109/L), should also raise the suspicion of HIT.13 By comparison, thrombocytopenia induced by sulfa drugs and quinine is typically much more severe. (from uspharmacist.com)
Clinical Results
The conclusion that Argatroban is an effective treatment for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome (HITTS) is based upon the data from a historically controlled efficacy and safety study (Study 1) and a follow-on efficacy and safety study (Study 2). These studies were comparable with regard to study design, study objectives, dosing regimens as well as study outline, conduct, and monitoring.
In these studies, 568 adult patients were treated with Argatroban and 193 adult patients made up the historical control group. Patients were required to have a clinical diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, either without thrombosis (HIT) or with thrombosis (HITTS) and be males or non-pregnant females between the age of 18 and 80 years old.
Patients with documented unexplained aPTT greater than 200% of control at baseline, documented coagulation disorder or bleeding diathesis unrelated to HITTS, a lumbar puncture within the past 7 days or a history of previous aneurysm, hemorrhagic stroke, or recent thrombotic stroke, within the past 6 months, unrelated to HITTS were excluded from these studies.
The primary efficacy analysis was based on a comparison of event rates for a composite endpoint that included death (all causes), amputation (all causes) or new thrombosis during the treatment and follow-up period (study days 0 to 37). Secondary analyses included evaluation of the event rates for the components of the composite endpoint as well as time-to-event analyses.
A categorical analysis showed a significant improvement in the composite outcome in patients with HIT and HITTS treated with Argatroban versus those in the historical control group.

","Additional Information
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are, and because of the potential for nursing-infant harm, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug.","Mechanism of Action
Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that reversibly binds to the thrombin active site. It does not require the co-factor antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Argatroban exerts its anticoagulant effects by inhibiting thrombin-catalyzed or induced reactions, including fibrin formation; activation of coagulation factors V, VIII, and XIII; protein C; and platelet aggregation.
Argatroban is highly selective for thrombin with an inhibitory constant of 0.04 uM. At therapeutic concentrations, argatroban has little or no effect on related serine proteases.
Argatroban is capable of inhibiting the action of both free and clot-associated thrombin. It does not interact with heparin-induced antibodies. (from fda.gov)

Cardiology/Vascular Diseases,Atacand (candesartan cilexetil),"General Information
Atacand HCT (candesartan cilexetil-hydrochlorothiazide) has been developed for the treatment of hypertension, and may be helpful when single products are unsuccessful in reducing blood pressure. Atacand HCT consists of two active ingredients: an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and a diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. It works by inhibiting the effects of angiotensin II, which is an agent that causes vasoconstriction and high blood pressure. Additionally, hydrochlorothiazide reduces blood pressure by improving the kidneys' ability to eliminate salt and fluid from the body. Atacand HCT is available in two tablet strengths: 32 mg Atacand-12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 16 mg Atacand-12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide.
Clinical Results
Five double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluated candesartan cilexetil-hydrochlorothiazide. These five trials, of 8 to 12 weeks duration, consisted of 3037 hypertensive patients. Doses ranged from 2 to 32 mg candesartan cilexetil and from 6.25 to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide administered once daily in various combinations.
The combination of candesartan cilexetil-hydrochlorothiazide resulted in placebo-adjusted decreases in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 14-18/8-11 mm Hg at doses of 16-12.5 mg and 32-12.5 mg (the two tablet stengths). In long-term studies of up to one year, the blood pressure lowering effect of the combination was maintained.
","Side Effects
The most common adverse events observed with Atacand HCT use include the following:
Upper respiratory infection
Dizziness
Back pain
Flu-like symptoms
Atacand HCT should not be used by pregnant women and should be discontinued if pregnancy is detected.

Approximately one in every four American adults, and more than half of all Americans over age 65 have high blood pressure. For more information on hypertension and heart-related conditions please visit the web site of the American Heart Association.
For more information on Atacand HCT, please visit the web site of AstraZeneca.","Mechanism of Action
Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.
Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium.

Atryn is a recombinant antithrombin. Recombinant antithrombin is produced by recombinant DNA technology using genetically engineered goats. The amino acid sequence of recombinant antithrombin is identical to that of human plasma-derived antithrombin. Antithrombin plays a central role in the regulation of hemostasis and is the principal inhibitor of thrombin and Factor Xa5, the serine proteases that play pivotal roles in blood coagulation. Antithrombin neutralizes the activity of thrombin and Factor Xa by forming a complex which is rapidly removed from the circulation.
Atryn is specifically indicated for the prevention of peri-operative and peri-partum thromboembolic events in hereditary antithrombin deficient patients.
Atryn is supplied as a powder for reconstitution designed for intravenous administration. The dosage of ATryn is to be individualized based on the patientâ€™s pre-treatment functional antithrombin activity level (expressed in percent of normal) and body weight (expressed in kilograms) and using therapeutic drug monitoring. The goal of treatment is to restore and maintain functional antithrombin activity levels between 80% - 120% of normal (0.8 - 1.2 IU/mL). Treatment should be initiated prior to delivery or approximately 24 hours prior to surgery. Administer loading dose as a 15-minute intravenous infusion, immediately followed by a continuous infusion of the maintenance dose.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Atryn was based on the results of two clinical studies. These single-arm, open-label studies were conducted in 31 ATryn treated hereditary antithrombin (AT) deficient patients and 35 human plasma-derived AT treated hereditary AT deficient patients. The endpoint was non-inferiority in the reduction in the incidence of the occurrence of venous thromboembolic events between the two treatment arms. ATryn was administered as a continuous infusion for at least 3 days, starting one day prior to the surgery or delivery. Plasma AT was administered for at least two days as single bolus infusions. The efficacy was assessed during treatment with AT and up to 7 days after stopping AT treatment. In the human plasma derived AT group, there were 0 incidences of thromboembolic events and in the ATryn treated arm, there was one confirmed diagnosis of an acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Cardiology/Vascular Diseases,Azor (amlodipine besylate; olmesartan medoxomil),"General Information
Azor is a combination of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist olmesartan, and the calcium channel blocker amlodipine. The amlodipine component of Azor inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle, and the olmesartan medoxomil component of Azor blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II.
Azor is specifically indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents.
Azor is supplied as a tablet designed for oral administration. The drug comes in four strengths; the amlodipine dose is listed first and the olmesartan dose is listed second (both in mg): 5/20, 5/40, 10/20 and 10/40. The dosage may be increased after two weeks. The maximum recommended dose of Azor is 10/40.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Azor was based on the results of several clinical trials.
Azor
An 8-week, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group, factorial study enrolled 1,940 subjects with mild to severe hypertension. The subjects were placed in one of 12 treatment arms to receive placebo, monotherapy treatment with amlodipine 5 mg or 10 mg, monotherapy treatment with olmesartan medoxomil 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg, or combination therapy with amlodipine/olmesartan medoxomil (Azor) at doses of 5/10 mg, 5/20 mg, 5/40 mg, 10/10 mg, 10/20 mg, and 10/40 mg. Results showed that all combinations produced greater mean reductions in blood pressure than either drug alone. The highest combination dose was amlodipine 10 mg plus 40 mg olmesartan. At this dose systolic blood pressure was cut by 30.1 mm Hg, a 53% greater drop than with 10 mg amlodipine alone. Diastolic blood pressure on this dose was reduced by 19 mm Hg, compared to 12.7 for amlodipine alone.
Amlodipine
The anti-hypertensive activity of amlodipine was evaluated in 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies. The trials enrolled a total of 1,338 subjects with mild to moderate hypertension who were treated with amoldipine or placebo once daily. Amoldipine resulted in statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect.
Olmesartan medoxomil
The anti-hypertensive activity of olmesartan was evaluated in 7 placebo controlled studies. A total of 2,693 subjects with essential hypertension were enrolled and received placebo or olmesartan at doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 80 mg, for 6 to 12 weeks. The blood pressure lowering effect was maintained throughout the 24-hour period, with trough-to-peak ratios for systolic and diastolic response between 60% and 80%.
","Side Effects

Cardiology/Vascular Diseases,Baycol (cerivastatin sodium),"General Information
Baycol (cerivastatin sodium), a new cholesterol-lowering agent by Bayer Corporation, was initially FDA approved in 1997. Baycol is a statin indicated as an adjunct to diet for patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia who have not responded adequately to dietary restrictions and other non-pharmacological measures. Baycol has been shown to be effective at relatively low doses at lowering LDL-cholesterol as well as total cholesterol and triglycerides.
However, the company voluntarily withdrew Baycol from the market on August 8, 2001 because of reports of sometimes fatal rhabdomyolysis, a severe muscle adverse reaction from the cholesterol-lowering product. The FDA received reports of 31 US deaths due to severe rhabdomyolsis from Baycol.",,,
Cardiology/Vascular Diseases,Benicar,"General Information
Benicar is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) approved for the treatment of hypertension. This once-daily oral tablet that may be administered alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.
Hypertension, the term used for abnormally high blood pressure, is the most common health problem in the United States. Over 50 million Americans suffer from hypertension, but many are unaware of the problem and remain untreated. Left untreated, it can lead to serious and life-threatening events including stroke and heart attack.
Clinical Results
Approval of Benicar is supported by 7 placebo-controlled studies, with doses ranging from 2.5 to 80 mg, given for six to 12 weeks. The trials included more than 3275 subjects with essential hypertension. All seven studies reported significant reductions in peak and trough levels of diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Response was dose-related, with 20 mg and 40 mg doses inducing the desired effect and doses over 40 mg having little additional effect. The blood pressure lowering effect from using Benicar once-daily was maintained throughout the 24 hour period, with trough-to-peak ratios for systolic and diastolic response between 60 and 80%.

Cardiology/Vascular Diseases,Betapace AF Tablet,"General Information
Betapace AF is a medication for the treatment of atrial fibrillation/flutter (AFIB/AFL) in patients with symptomatic AFIB/AFL, with or without structural heart disease but in the absence of uncompensated congestive heart failure. This drug will help maintain the heart in sinus rhythm.
Clinical Results
Two primary studies of Betapace were conducted in patients with symptomatic AFIB/AFL. The first of these studies investigated patients with primarily paroxysmal AFIB/AFL. No structural heart disease was present in 43% of the patients. Patients were given either one or two doses daily, depending on renal function. Results indicated that the drug prolonged the time to the first symptomatic recurrence of AFIB/AFL and also reduced the risk of recurrence at six and twelve months. The 120 mg dose was shown to be more effective than the 80 mg dose. However, there were no significant differences between the 160 mg and 120 mg doses.
The second study investigated patients whose AFIB/AFL was chronic. Structural heart disease was present in 49% of the patients. All patients had chronic AFIB for more than two weeks and less than one year. Results showed that compared to a placebo, there was a longer time to recurrence of AFIB and there was a reduced risk of recurrence at six months.
Further trials also investigated the effect of Betapace's active ingredient, sotalol, on post- myocardial infarction (MI) patients. The drug did not significantly decrease the mortality rate in patients taking the drug, compared to a placebo. However, the investigation determined that there was no increased risk for post-MI patients receiving the drug.
In eight clinical trials with a total of 659 patients, there were four cases of torsade de pointes (TdP), a serious and dangerous ventricular arrhythmia.
","Side Effects
Betapace AF can cause serious ventricular arrhythmias, primarily torsade de pointes (TdP). Patients taking this drug should be monitored carefully with electrocardiogram.
Side effects may include:
Bradycardia
Fatigue
Fainting
Dizziness
Tachycardia
Severe diarrhea
Unusual sweating
Vomiting
Decreased appetite
Increased thirst
Contraindications to Betapace AF include:
chronic renal failure
chronic lung disease (such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema)
heart failure
bradycardia
","Additional Information
For a brief overview of the drug Betapace, visit Yahoo! Health
Visit the Berlex Laboratories, Inc. web site to find out more about Betapace AF and about other products developed by the company that made this drug:","Mechanism of Action
Betapace AF (sotalol hydrochloride) has both beta-andrenoreceptor blocking (Vaughan Williams Class II) and cardiac action potential duration prolongation (Vaughan Williams Class III) antiarrhythmic properties. Betapace AF (sotalol hydrochloride) is a racemic mixture of d- and l-sotalol. Both isomers have similar Class III antiarrhythmic effects, while the l-isomer is responsible for virtually all of the beta-blocking activity. The beta-blocking effect of sotalol is non-cardioselective, half maximal at about 80 mg/day and maximal at doses between 320 and 360 mg/day. Sotalol does not have partial agonist or membrane stabilizing activity. Although significant beta-blockade occurs at oral doses as low as 25 mg, significant Class III effects are seen only at daily doses of 160 mg or above.

Cardiology/Vascular Diseases,Bevyxxa (betrixaban),"General Information
Bevyxxa (betrixaban) is a factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor.
Bevyxxa is specifically indicated for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adult patients hospitalized for an acute medical illness who are at risk for thromboembolic complications due to moderate or severe restricted mobility and other risk factors for VTE.
Bevyxxa is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended dose is an initial single dose of 160 mg, followed by 80 mg once daily, taken at the same time each day with food. The recommended duration of treatment is 35 to 42 days. Reduce dose for patients with severe renal impairment. Reduce dose for patients on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Bevyxxa was based on APEX, a randomized, double-blind, multinational study comparing extended duration Bevyxxa to short duration of enoxaparin in the prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in an acutely medically ill hospitalized population with risk factors for VTE. Oral betrixaban for 35 to 42 days was compared with injectable enoxaparin for 6 to 14 days followed by placebo. Bevyxxa efficacy was measured in the modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) analysis, which includes 7,441 patients assessed by a composite outcome score comprising either the occurrence of asymptomatic proximal DVT or symptomatic DVT, non-fatal PE or VTE-related death. Bevyxxa reduced the incidence of DVT and PE blood clots compared with those taking enoxaparin plus placebo (4.4 percent vs. 6.0 percent) with no significant increase in major bleeding (0.67 percent vs. 0.57 percent). The most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation was bleeding, with an incidence rate for all bleeding episodes of 2.4 percent and 1.2 percent for betrixaban and enoxaparin, respectively.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Bevyxxa may include, but are not limited to, the following:
bleeding
The Bevyxxa label comes with the following Black Box Warning:
SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA
Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with betrixaban who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. The risk of these events may be increased by the use of in-dwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medical products affecting hemostasis. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures.

Cardiology/Vascular Diseases,BiDil (isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine hydrochloride),"General Information
BiDil is a single-pill, fixed-dose combination of two generic drugs, isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride. The combination exerts vasodialtory effects on both arterial and veinous vascular systems.
BiDil is specifically indicated for the adjunctive treatment of heart failure in self identified black patients, in addition to standard therapy. Addition of BiDil to standard regimens is aimed at prolonging time to hospitalization, improving patient-reported functional status, and reducing all-cause mortality. BiDil was not significantly efficacious in treating broader patient populations or other self-identified racial groups.
BiDilis supplied as a biconvex film-coated orange tablet. The recommended initial dose is one tablet of BiDil (20 mg isosorbide dinitrate, 37.5 mg hydralazine hydrochloride) thrice daily. Regimens may be titrated to maximum tollerated dose as required, but should not exceed 2 tablets thrice daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Approval of BiDil was based on two placebo-controlled clinical trials (V-HeFT I and A-HeFT) and one active-controlled clinical trial (V-HeFT II), which compared BiDil to enalapril. V-HeFT I enrolled 459 men with impaired cardiac function and reduced exercise tolerance, who were randomized to receive 75 mg/40 mg qid (n=186) or placebo (n=273), in addition to continuation of standard therapy with digitalis glycosides and diuretics. Trial data from the general patient cohort yielded no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the treatment group and placebo, though a trend towards improvement was noted. Retrospective analysis showed that this trend correlated with patientsâ€™ self-identified racial group: patients who self-identified as black or African-American showed improvements in survival, while self identified white or Caucasian-American patients showed no difference from placebo.
The V-HeFT II trial enrolled 804 men with impaired cardiac function and reduced exercise tolerance, who were randomized to receive either 75 mg/40 mg or enalapril, in addition to continuation of standard therapy with digitalis glycosides and diuretics. Trial data indicated that the drug combination was inferior to enalapril. Retrospecitve analysis again indicated that efficacy correlated with self-identified race: inferiority was observed only in the white population (n=574), with no significant difference in black patients (n=215).
The A-HeFT trial enrolled 1,050 self- identified black patients (men and women) with stable symptomatic heart failure across 169 sites in the United States. Subjects were randomized to receive either BiDil (n=518) or placebo (n=532) for up to 18 months, in addition to maintained stable background therapy. BiDil dosing was initiate at 20 mg isosorbide dinitrate/37.5 mg hydralazine hydrochloride three times daily, and titrated to a target dose of 40/75 mg three times daily or to the maximum tolerated dose. Trial results yielded significant efficacy in the primary endpoint, a composite score of all-cause mortality, first-hospitalization for heart failure, and responses to the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHF) questionnaire. Specifically, BiDil produced a 43% reduction in all cause mortality (p=0.012) and 8% fewer first-hospitalizations (16.4% vs. 24.4%; p<0.001), and a highly significant reduction in MLHF score (p<0.01) at 12 months vs. placebo; these strongly positive results produced significant improvement in the composite score (p<0.021), and lead to early termination of the trial so that subjects receiving placebo could be switched to the BiDil regimen. Secondary results indicated that the drug produced a reduction in mean blood pressure (3/3 mmHg lower) compared to placebo; whether this effect contributed to improved primary patient outcomes was unknown.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of BiDil may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Malaise
Cholecystitis
Hypercholesterolemia
Angioedema
Headache
Dizziness
Chest Pain
Asthenia
Nausea
Bronchitis
Hypotension
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding BiDil or heart failure, please visit the BiDil web page.","Mechanism of Action
The specific mechanism of action of the comnbination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride has not been established. Independently, isosorbide dinitrate has been shown to exert vasodilatory effects in both arteries and veins. The drug releases nitric oxide, activating guanylyl cyclase and relaxing vascular smooth muscle. Hydralazine has also been shown to relax arterial smooth muscle, and may mitigate tolerance to nitrate therapy, thus exerting synergistic activity with isosorbide.

Cardiology/Vascular Diseases,Brilinta (ticagrelor),"General Information
Brilinta (ticagrelor) is a reversibly binding oral adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonist. It selectively inhibits P2Y12, a key target receptor for ADP. ADP receptor blockade inhibits the action of platelets in the blood, reducing recurrent thrombotic events.
Brilinta is specifically indicated to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, or ST elevation myocardial infarction).
Brilinta is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is 180 mg (two 90 mg tablets) loading dose and continue treatment with 90 mg twice daily. After the initial loading dose of aspirin (usually 325 mg), use Brilinta with a daily maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Brilinta was based on a randomized double-blind study, PLATO. This study compared Brilinta (n=9333) to clopidogrel (n=9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in subjects with acute coronary syndromes. The treatment duration was at least six months and for up to 12 months. Subjects who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms were randomized to receive Brilinta or clopidogrel. Brilinta was administered at a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Clopidogrel was administered at an initial loading dose of 300 mg, if previous clopidogrel therapy had not been given prior to randomization. Subjects undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. Concomitant aspirin was recommended at a loading dose of 160-500 mg. The studyâ€™s primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Brilinta achieved greater efficacy over clopidogrel (9.8% vs. 11.7% at 12 months; p<0.001), without an increase in major bleeding (11.6% vs. 11.2%, p=0.43). A statistically significant reduction in both CV death (4.0% vs. 5.1%, p=0.001) and heart attacks was also observed (5.8% vs. 6.9%, p=0.005) with no difference in stroke (1.5% vs. 1.3%, p=0.22). Brilinta also demonstrated significant results across multiple secondary efficacy endpoints including CV death (4.0% vs. 5.1%, p=0.001); all-cause mortality (4.5% vs. 5.9%, p<0.001); myocardial infarction (5.8% vs. 6.9%, p=0.005); the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality (10.2% vs. 12.3%, p<0.001) and a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, recurrent cardiac ischemia, severe recurrent cardiac ischemia, and other arterial thrombotic events (14.6% vs. 16.7%, p<0.001). When PLATO minor bleeding was added to the major bleeding results, Brilinta showed an increase versus clopidogrel (16.1% vs. 14.6%, p=0.008). There was also an increase in non-procedural related bleeding with Brilinta.

Caduet combines the drugs amlodipine (Norvasc, Lotrel) and atorvastatin (Lipitor), two widely prescribed cardiovascular medications. It's the first medicine to treat two different conditions, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
It is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, chronic stable angina and vasospastic angina (Prinzmetalâ€™s or variant angina). It is also indicated for primary dysbetalipoproteinemia, elevated serum TG levels, hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. In addition, is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce total-C, LDL-C, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
The recommened initial antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine is 5 mg once daily with a maximum dose of 10 mg once daily.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Caduet was based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling 1,600 subjects with co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia. Results showed that all combination-treatment groups of amlodipine and atorvastatin demonstrated statistically significant dose-related reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood pressure (DBP) and LDL-C compared to placebo.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Caduet or cardiovascular disorders, please contact The Pfizer Web Site","Mechanism of Action
Amlodipine, a long acting calcium ion antagonist, is the active ingredient in Norvasc (Pfizer) and Lotrel (Novartis). Amlodipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The drug binds to dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. In addition, amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.
Atorvastatin, a HMGCoA reductase inhibitor indicated for lowering cholesterol, is the active ingredient in Lipitor (Pfizer). Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell-surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL.

Cardiomyopathy,Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) and Vyndamax (tafamidis),"General Information
Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) and Vyndamax (tafamidis) are oral transthyretin stabilizers.
Vyndaqel and Vyndamax are specifically indicated for the treatment of the cardiomyopathy of wild type or hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) in adults to reduce cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalization.
Vyndaqel and Vyndamax are supplied as capsules for oral administration. The recommended dose is either Vyndaqel 80 mg (four 20-mg tafamidis meglumine capsules) orally once daily or Vyndanmax 61 mg (one 61-mg tafamidis capsule) orally once daily.
Vyndamax was developed for patient convenience. Vyndaqel and Vyndamax are not substitutable on a per milligram basis.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval was based on a multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 441 patients with wild type or hereditary ATTR-CM. Patients were randomized in a 1:2:2 ratio to receive Vyndaqel 20 mg (n=88), Vyndaqel 80 mg (administered as four 20-mg Vyndaqel capsules) (n=176), or matching placebo (n=177) once daily for 30 months, in addition to standard of care (e.g., diuretics). Treatment assignment was stratified by the presence or absence of a variant TTR genotype as well as baseline disease severity (NYHA Class). Transplant patients were excluded from this study. The analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in the pooled Vyndaqel 20 mg and 80 mg arms versus placebo. Analysis of the individual components of the primary analysis (all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations) also demonstrated significant reductions for Vyndaqel versus placebo.
","Side Effects
In clinical trials, the frequency of adverse events in patients treated with Vyndaqel was similar to placebo, and similar proportions of Vyndaqel-treated patients and placebo-treated patients discontinued the study drug because of an adverse event.

Cardiovascular Abnormalities,Invokana (canagliflozin),"General Information
Invokana (canagliflozin) is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. Inhibiting SGLT2 is believed to reduce blood glucose levels by increasing the amount of glucose excreted in the urine.
Invokana is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Invokana was subsequently approved to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. Invokana was approved in September of 2019 to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), worsening of kidney function, cardiovascular (CV) death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (nephropathy) with a certain amount of protein in the urine.
Invokana is supplied as tablets for oral administration. The recommended starting dose of Invokana is 100 mg once daily, taken before the first meal of the day. In patients tolerating Invokana 100 mg once daily who have an eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater and require additional glycemic control, the dose can be increased to 300 mg once daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Invokana was based in part on a monotherapy study. Invokana was also studied in combination with metformin, sulfonylurea, metformin and sulfonylurea, metformin and a thiazolidinedione and in combination with insulin (with or without other antihyperglycemic agents). The efficacy of Invokana was compared to a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (sitagliptin) and a sulfonylurea (glimepiride).
Monotherapy Study
A a 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 584 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise. Patients taking other antihyperglycemic agents discontinued the agent and underwent an 8-week washout followed by a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period. Patients not taking oral antihyperglycemic agents entered the 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period directly. After the placebo run-in period, subjects were randomized to Invokana 100 mg, 300 mg, or placebo, administered once daily for 26 weeks. At the end of treatment, Invokana 100 mg and 300 mg once daily resulted in a statistically significant improvement in HbA1C (p-value <0.001 for both doses) compared to placebo. Invokana 100 mg and 300 mg once daily also resulted in a greater proportion of patients achieving an HbA1C less than 7%, in significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), in improved postprandial glucose (PPG), and in percent body weight reduction compared to placebo. Statistically significant mean changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure relative to placebo were -3.7 mmHg and -5.4 mmHg with Invokana 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively (p<0.001 for both doses).
Efficacy Studies
Invokana compared to glimepiride, both as add-on combination with metformin
A 52-week, double-blind, active controlled study enrolled 1,450 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. Subjects received Invokana 100 mg or 300 mg, or glimepiride (titration allowed throughout the 52-week study to 6 or 8 mg), administered once daily as add-on therapy to metformin. Invokana 100 mg provided similar reductions in HbA1C from baseline compared to glimepiride when added to metformin therapy. Invokana 300 mg provided a greater reduction from baseline in HbA1C compared to glimepiride, and the relative treatment difference was -0.12%. Treatment with Invokana 100 mg and 300 mg daily provided greater improvements in percent body weight change, relative to glimepiride.
Invokana compared to sitagliptin, both as add-on combination therapy with metformin and sulfonylurea
A 52-week, double-blind, active-controlled study enrolled 755 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on the combination of metformin and sulfonylurea. The subjects received Invokana 300 mg or sitagliptin 100 mg in combination with metformin and sulfonylurea. Invokana 300 mg provided greater HbA1C reduction compared to sitagliptin 100 mg when added to metformin and sulfonylurea (p<0.05).
Invokana 300 mg resulted in a mean percent change in body weight from baseline of -2.5% compared to +0.3% with sitagliptin 100 mg. A mean change in systolic blood pressure from baseline of -5.06 mmHg was observed with Invokana 300 mg compared to +0.85 mmHg with sitagliptin 100 mg.
The FDA approval of Invokana to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events was based on the CANVAS (CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study) Program which evaluated the effect of Invokana on CV risk in a broad population of more than 10,000 adults with T2D who had established CV disease (65 percent) or were at risk for cardiovascular disease with two or more risk factors (35 percent). Overall, treatment with Invokana as compared with placebo in addition to standard of care reduced the combined risk of heart attack, stroke and CV death by 14% (events occurred in 26.9 vs. 31.5 participants, respectively, per 1000 patient-years). In patients with established CV disease, treatment with Invokana reduced the combined risk of heart attack, stroke and CV death by 18% compared to placebo (events occurred in 34.1 vs. 41.3 participants, respectively, per 1000 patient-years).
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Invokana may include, but are not limited to, the following:
female genital mycotic infections
urinary tract infection
increased urination
The Invokana drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning: LOWER LIMB AMPUTATION â€¢ An approximately 2-fold increased risk of lower limb amputations associated with Invokana use was observed in CANVAS and CANVAS-R, two large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in patients with type 2 diabetes who had established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or were at risk for CVD. â€¢ Amputations of the toe and midfoot were most frequent; however, amputations involving the leg were also observed. Some patients had multiple amputations, some involving both limbs. â€¢ Before initiating, consider factors that may increase the risk of amputation, such as a history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy, and diabetic foot ulcers. â€¢ Monitor patients receiving Invokana for infection, new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs, and discontinue if these complications occur.
","Additional Information

Invokana (canagliflozin) is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), expressed in the proximal renal tubules, is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen. Canagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, canagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose (RTG), and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.

Cardiovascular Abnormalities,Kynamro (mipomersen sodium),"General Information
Kynamro (mipomersen sodium) inhibits the ApoB-100 molecule, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the production of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). It reduces LDL-C by preventing the formation of atherogenic lipoproteins, the particles that carry cholesterol through the bloodstream.
Kynamro is specifically indicated as an adjunct to lipid-lowering medications and diet to reduce low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), total cholesterol 31 (TC), and non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).
Kynamro is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous injection. The recommended dose is 200 milligrams (mg) once weekly.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Kynamro was based on a multinational, randomized placebo controlled, 26-week trial in 51 subjects with HoFH. Kynamro was given as 200 mg weekly subcutaneous injections, as an adjunct to lipid-lowering medications. The primary efficacy endpoint was percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 28. At Week 28, the mean and median percent changes in LDL-C from baseline were -25% (p<0.001) and -19%, respectively, for the Kynamro group. The mean and median treatment difference from placebo was -21% and -19%, respectively.

Mipomersen is an antisense oligonucleotide targeted to human messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for apo B-100, the principal apolipoprotein of LDL and its metabolic precursor, VLDL. Mipomersen is complementary to the coding region of the mRNA for apo B-100, and binds by Watson and Crick base pairing. The hybridization of mipomersen to the cognate mRNA results in RNase H-mediated degradation of the cognate mRNA thus inhibiting translation of the apo B-100 protein.

Cardiovascular Abnormalities,Praluent (alirocumab),"General Information
Praluent (alirocumab) is a PCSK9 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin Type 9) inhibitor antibody.
Praluent is specifically indicated as adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who require additional lowering of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). Praluent is also indicated to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adults with established cardiovascular (CV) disease.
Praluent is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous use. The recommended starting dose for Praluent is 75 mg administered subcutaneously once every 2 weeks, since the majority of patients achieve sufficient LDL-C reduction with this dosage. If the LDL-C response is inadequate, the dosage may be increased to the maximum dosage of 150 mg administered every 2 weeks.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Praluent was based on five double-blind placebo-controlled trials that enrolled 3,499 patients; 36% were patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and 54% were non-FH patients who had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Three of the five trials were conducted exclusively in patients with HeFH. All patients were receiving a maximally tolerated dose of a statin, with or without other lipid-modifying therapies. All trials were at least 52 weeks in duration with the primary efficacy endpoint measured at week 24 (mean percent change in LDL-C from baseline). Three studies used an initial dose of 75 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) followed by criteria-based uptitration to 150 mg Q2W at week 12 for patients who did not achieve their pre-defined target LDL-C at week 8. The majority of patients (57% to 83%) who were treated for at least 12 weeks did not require up-titration. Two studies used a 150 mg Q2W dose.
Study 1 was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned 1,553 patients to Praluent 150 mg Q2W and 788 patients to placebo. Overall, 69% were non-FH patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 18% had HeFH. The average LDL-C at baseline was 122 mg/dL. At week 24, the treatment difference between Praluent and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -58% (p-value: Ë‚0.0001).
Study 2 was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned 209 patients to Praluent and 107 to placebo. Overall 84% had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline LDL-C was 102 mg/dL. At week 12, the mean percent change from baseline in LDL-C was -45% with Praluent compared to 1% with placebo, and the treatment difference between Praluent 75mg Q2W and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -46%. At week 12, if additional LDL-C lowering was required based on pre-specified LDL-C criteria, Praluent was up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W for the remainder of the trial. At week 24, the mean percent change from baseline in LDL-C was -44% with Praluent and -2% with placebo, and the treatment difference between Praluent and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -43% (p-value: Ë‚0.0001). The dose was up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W in 32 (17%) of 191 patients treated with Praluent for at least 12 weeks.
Studies 3 and 4 were multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that, combined, randomly assigned 490 patients to Praluent and 245 to placebo. The trials were similar with regard to both design and eligibility criteria. All patients had HeFH, were taking a maximally tolerated dose of statin with or without other lipid-modifying therapy, and required additional LDL-C reduction. Overall, 45% of these patients with HeFH also had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The average LDL-C at baseline was 141 mg/dL. At week 12, the treatment difference between Praluent 75 mg Q2W and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -48%. At week 12, if additional LDL-C lowering was required based on pre-specified LDL-C criteria, Praluent was up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W for the remainder of the trials. At week 24, the mean treatment difference between Praluent and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change from baseline was -54% (p-value: Ë‚0.0001). The dose was up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W in 196 (42%) of 469 patients treated with Praluent for at least 12 weeks. The LDL-C-lowering effect was sustained to week 52.
Study 5 was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned 72 patients to Praluent 150 mg Q2W and 35 patients to placebo. Patients had HeFH with a baseline LDL-C â‰¥160 mg/dL while taking a maximally tolerated dose of statin with or without other lipid-modifying therapy. Overall, 50% had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The average LDL-C at baseline was 198 mg/dL. At week 24, the mean percent change from baseline in LDL-C was -43% with Praluent and -7% with placebo, and the treatment difference between Praluent and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -36% (p-value: Ë‚0.0001).
The FDA approval of Praluent to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adults with established cardiovascular (CV) disease was based on ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, assessing the effect of adding Praluent to maximally-tolerated statins on CV outcomes in 18,924 patients who had an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) within a year of enrolling in the trial. Patients who received Praluent in the trial experienced:
A 15% reduced risk for major CV events. The primary endpoint included time to first heart attack, stroke, death from coronary heart disease (CHD), or unstable angina requiring hospitalization
A 27% reduced risk of stroke, 14% reduced risk of non-fatal heart attack and 39% reduced risk of unstable angina requiring hospitalization.
A 15% reduced risk of death from any cause (also called all-cause mortality) was also observed.

Praluent (alirocumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) on the surface of hepatocytes to promote LDLR degradation within the liver. LDLR is the primary receptor that clears circulating LDL, therefore the decrease in LDLR levels by PCSK9 results in higher blood levels of LDL-C. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, alirocumab increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.

Cardiovascular Abnormalities,Repatha (evolocumab),"General Information
Repatha (evolocumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody to Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9), a negative regulator of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR).
Repatha is specifically indicated for the following:
as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), who require additional lowering of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) for the treatment of patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C.
Repatha is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous administration. The recommended subcutaneous dosage in patients with HeFH or patients with primary hyperlipidemia with established clinical atherosclerotic CVD is either 140 mg every 2 weeks OR 420 mg once monthly. When switching dosage regimens, administer the first dose of the new regimen on the next scheduled date of the prior regimen. The recommended subcutaneous dosage in patients with HoFH is 420 mg once monthly. In patients with HoFH, measure LDL-C levels 4 to 8 weeks after starting Repatha, since response to therapy will depend on the degree of LDL-receptor function.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Repatha was based on the following trials:
Primary Hyperlipidemia in Patients with Clinical Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease:
Study 1 was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in which patients were initially randomized to an open-label specific statin regimen for a 4-week lipid stabilization period followed by random assignment to subcutaneous injections of Repatha 140 mg every 2 weeks, Repatha 420 mg once monthly, or placebo for 12 weeks. The trial included 296 patients with atherosclerotic CVD who received Repatha or placebo as add-on therapy to daily doses of atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 40 mg, or simvastatin 40 mg. After 4 weeks of statin therapy, the mean baseline LDL-C was 108 mg/dL. In these patients with atherosclerotic CVD who were on maximum-dose statin therapy, the difference between Repatha and placebo in mean percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 12 was -71% (p < 0.0001) and -63% (p Ë‚ 0.0001) for the 140 mg every 2 weeks and 420 mg once monthly dosages, respectively.
Study 2 was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 52-week trial that included 139 patients with atherosclerotic CVD who received protocol-determined background lipid-lowering therapy of atorvastatin 80 mg daily with or without ezetimibe 10 mg daily. After stabilization on background therapy, patients were randomly assigned to the addition of placebo or Repatha 420 mg administered subcutaneously once monthly. After stabilization on the assigned background therapy, the mean baseline LDL-C was 105 mg/dL. In these patients with atherosclerotic CVD on maximum-dose atorvastatin therapy with or without ezetimibe, the difference between Repatha 420 mg once monthly and placebo in mean percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 52 was -54 % (p Ë‚0.0001).
Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH):
Study 3 was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial in 329 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) on statins with or without other lipid-lowering therapies. Patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of Repatha 140 mg every two weeks, 420 mg once monthly, or placebo. HeFH was diagnosed by the Simon Broome criteria (1991). In Study 3, 38% of patients had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The average LDL-C at baseline was 156 mg/dL with 76% of the patients on high- intensity statin therapy. In these patients with HeFH on statins with or without other lipid lowering therapies, the differences between Repatha and placebo in mean percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 12 was -61% (p < 0.0001) and -60% (p < 0.0001) for the 140 mg every 2 weeks and 420 mg once monthly dosages, respectively.
Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia:
Study 4 was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial in 49 patients (not on lipid-apheresis therapy) with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). In this trial, 33 patients received subcutaneous injections of 420 mg of Repatha once monthly and 16 patients received placebo as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe). The trial included 10 adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years), 7 of whom received Repatha. The mean LDL-C at baseline was 349 mg/dL with all patients on statins (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) and 92% on ezetimibe. The diagnosis of HoFH was made by genetic confirmation or a clinical diagnosis based on a history of an untreated LDL-C concentration > 500 mg/dL together with either xanthoma before 10 years of age or evidence of HeFH in both parents. In these patients with HoFH, the difference between Repatha and placebo in mean percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 12 was -31% (p < 0.0001).

Cardiovascular Abnormalities,Xarelto (rivaroxaban),"General Information
Xarelto (rivaroxaban) is a factor Xa inhibitor.
Xarelto is specifically indicated for use in combination with aspirin, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke) in patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease (PAD).
Xarelto is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is this population is 2.5 mg orally twice daily, with or without food, in combination with aspirin (75-100 mg) once daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xarelto for risk reduction of major cardiovascular (CV) events in people with chronic coronary or peripheral artery disease was based on COMPASS, a Phase 3 clinical study of 27,395 patients with chronic CAD or PAD from 33 countries. The trial examined the use of Xarelto, alone or in combination with aspirin, for the long-term prevention of major adverse CV events, including heart attack, stroke and CV death. Results showed a significant 24% reduction of the risk of major CV events in patients with chronic CAD and/or PAD with the Xarelto 2.5-mg vascular dose twice daily plus aspirin 100 mg once daily, compared to aspirin alone. Specifically data showed a 42% reduction in stroke, 22% reduction in CV death and 14% reduction in heart attack. The risk of major bleeding was significantly higher in patients taking the Xarelto/aspirin regimen compared to aspirin alone, with no significant increase in fatal or intracranial bleeds.
","Side Effects
The most common adverse effect associated with the use of Xarelto is bleeding.
The Xarelto drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning:
(A) Premature discontinuation of Xarelto increases the risk of thrombotic events Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including Xarelto, increases the risk of thrombotic events. To reduce this risk, consider coverage with another anticoagulant if Xarelto is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy. (B) Spinal/epidural hematoma Epidural or spinal hematomas have occurred in patients treated with Xarelto who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment and if observed, treat urgently. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients who are or who need to be anticoagulated.

Patients were included with a cerebro- or cardiovascular diagnosis if they had been taking daily aspirin 325 mg for at least 3 months, were expected to require daily aspirin 325 mg therapy for at least 6 months and were over 55 years old. Subjects between 18 and 55 years old were also required to have a documented history of gastric or duodenal ulcer within the past 5 years. Studies 1 and 2 showed that Yosprala given as 325 mg/40 mg tablets once daily statistically significantly reduced the 6-month cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers compared to EC-aspirin 325 mg once daily. In both trials, patients receiving Yosprala 325 mg/40 mg tablets had a statistically significantly lower 6-month cumulative incidence of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers compared to EC-aspirin 325 mg (3% vs. 12%).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Yosprala may include, but are not limited to, the following:
gastritis
nausea
diarrhea
gastric polyps
non-cardiac chest pain
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Yosprala or the prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, please visit http://www.yospralahcp.com/","Mechanism of Action
Yosprala is a combination of aspirin, an anti-platelet agent, and omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is an inhibitor of both prostaglandin synthesis and platelet aggregation. Omeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the [H+ /K+ ]-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the gastric mucosa, omeprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is doserelated and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.

Cataracts,Omidria (phenylephrine and ketorolac injection),"General Information
Omidria (phenylephrine and ketorolac injection) is a combination of an anti-inflammatory agent and a mydriatic agent (causes pupil dilation, called mydriasis).
Omidria is specifically indicated for use during cataract surgery or intraocular lens replacement for maintaining pupil size by preventing intraoperative miosis and reducing postoperative ocular pain.
Omidria is supplied as a solution for intraocular administration. For administration 4 mL of Omidria is diluted in 500 mL of ophthalmic irrigation solution. Irrigation solution is to be used as needed for the surgical procedure.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Omidria was based on three phase III randomized, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 808 adult subjects undergoing cataract surgery or intraocular lens replacement. Subjects were randomized to either Omidria or placebo. Subjects were treated with preoperative topical mydriatic and anesthetic agents. Pupil diameter was measured throughout the surgical procedure. Postoperative pain was evaluated by self-administered 0-100 mm visual analog scales (VAS). Mydriasis was maintained in the Omidria-treated groups while the placebo-treated groups experienced progressive constriction. At the end of cortical clean-up, 23% of placebo-treated subjects and 4% of Omidria-treated subjects had a pupil diameter less than 6 mm (p < 0.01). Pain during the initial 10-12 hours postoperatively was statistically significantly less in the Omidria-treated groups than in the placebo-treated groups. During the 10-12 hours postoperatively, 26% of Omidria-treated subjects reported no pain (VAS = 0 at all timepoints) while 17% of placebo-treated subjects reported no pain (p < 0.01).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Omidria may include, but are not limited to, the following:
eye irritation
posterior capsule opacification
increased intraocular pressure
anterior chamber inflammation
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Omidria or intraoperative miosis and post-operative pain following eye surgery, please visit www.Omidria.com","Mechanism of Action
Omidria contains the active ingredienta phenylephrine and ketorolac. Phenylephrine is an a1-adrenergic receptor agonist and, in the eye, acts as a mydriatic agent by contracting the radial muscle of the iris. Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory that inhibits both cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), resulting in a decrease in tissue concentrations of prostaglandins to reduce pain due to surgical trauma. Ketorolac, by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis secondary to ocular surgical insult or direct mechanical stimulation of the iris, also prevents surgically induced miosis.

Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking antibody.
Keytruda is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS â‰¥1) as determined by an FDA-approved test.
Keytruda is supplied as a solution for intravenous administration. The recommended dose of Keytruda for cervical cancer is 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
This indication was approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.
The efficacy of Keytruda was investigated in 98 patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer enrolled in a single cohort (Cohort E) in KEYNOTE-158, a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort trial. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients received Keytruda 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression. Patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks for the first 12 months, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, as assessed by blinded independent central review, and duration of response. Among the 98 patients, approval was based on 77 (79%) patients who had tumors that expressed PD-L1 with a CPS â‰¥1 and who had received at least one line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. PD-L1 status was determined using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx Kit. With a median follow-up time of 11.7 months, the ORR in 77 patients was 14.3%, including 2.6% complete responses and 11.7% partial responses. The estimated median response duration based on 11 patients with a response by independent review was not reached; 91% had a response duration of greater than or equal to 6 months. No responses were observed in patients whose tumors did not have PD-L1 expression (CPS Ë‚1).
","Side Effects

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Keytruda or recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, please visit https://www.keytruda.com/
Please Visit Inspire's Community Pages for this drug.","Mechanism of Action
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD 1)-blocking, humanized monoclonal IgG4 kappa antibody. Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response.

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Mytesi was based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (one month) and placebo-free (five month), multi center study. The study enrolled 374 HIV-positive patients on stable anti-retroviral therapy (ART) with a history of diarrhea for one month or more. The study had a two-stage adaptive design. In both stages, patients received placebo for 10 days (screening period) followed by randomization to crofelemer or placebo for 31 days of treatment (double-blind period). Only patients with 1 or more watery bowel movements per day on at least 5 of the last 7 days in the screening period were randomized to the double-blind period. Each stage enrolled patients separately; the dose for the second stage was selected based on an interim analysis of data from the first stage. In the first stage, subjects were randomized to one of three crofelemer dose regimens (125, 250, or 500 mg twice daily) or placebo. In the second stage, subjects were randomized to crofelemer 125 mg twice daily or placebo. Each study stage also had a five month period (placebo-free period) that followed the double blind period. Patients treated with crofelemer continued the same dose in the placebo-free period. In the first stage, patients that received placebo were re-randomized to one of the three crofelemer dose regimens (125, 250, or 500 mg twice daily) in the placebo-free period. In the second stage, patients that received placebo were treated with crofelemer 125 mg twice daily in the placebo-free period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a clinical response, defined as less than or equal to 2 watery bowel movements per week during at least 2 of the 4 weeks of the placebo-controlled phase.

Chronic Diarrhea,Viberzi (eluxadoline),"General Information
Viberzi (eluxadoline) is a mu-opioid receptor agonist and delta-opioid receptor antagonist. In vivo studies indicate that the activity of eluxadoline at the two different opioid receptors controls GI function as well as decreases pain and potentially mitigates the constipating effect of unopposed mu agonism.
Viberzi is specifically indicated in adults for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea.
Viberzi is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is 100 mg taken orally twice daily with food. In patients who do not have a gallbladde, are unable to tolerate the 100 mg dose of Viberzi, are receiving concomitant OATP1B1 inhibitors or have mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, the recommended dose is 75 mg taken orally twice daily with food.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Viberzi was based on two randomized, multi-center, multi-national, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2). A total of 1,281 patients in Study 1 and 1,145 patients in Study 2 received treatment with Viberzi 75 mg, Viberzi 100 mg or placebo twice daily. All patients met Rome III criteria for IBS-D and were required to meet both of the following criteria: an average of worst abdominal pain scores in the past 24 hours of >3.0 on a 0 to 10 scale over the week prior to randomization and an average daily stool consistency score (Bristol Stool Scale or BSS) of â‰¥5.5 and at least 5 days with a BSS score â‰¥5 on a 1 to 7 scale over the week prior to randomization. Study 1 and Study 2 included identical 26-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment periods. Study 1 continued double-blinded for an additional 26 weeks for long-term safety (total of 52 weeks of treatment), followed by a 2-week follow-up. Study 2 included a 4-week singleblinded, placebo-withdrawal period upon completion of the 26-week treatment period. Efficacy of Viberzi was assessed in both trials using an overall composite responder primary endpoint. The primary endpoint was defined by the simultaneous improvement in the daily worst abdominal pain score by â‰¥30% as compared to the baseline weekly average AND a reduction in the BSS to <5 on at least 50% of the days within a 12-week time interval. In both trials, the proportion of patients who were composite responders to Viberzi was statistically significantly higher than placebo for both doses.

Chronic Diarrhea,Xermelo (telotristat ethyl),"General Information
Xermelo (telotristat ethyl) is a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor. Xermelo targets the overproduction of serotonin inside mNET cells.
Xermelo is specifically indicated for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in combination with somatostatin analog (SSA) therapy in adults inadequately controlled by SSA therapy.
Xermelo is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dosage of Xermelo in adults is 250 mg three times daily for patients whose diarrhea is inadequately controlled by a SSA therapy. Xermelo should be ingested with food. When short-acting octreotide is used in combination with Xermelo, administer short-acting octreotide at least 30 minutes after administering Xermelo. Discontinue Xermelo if severe constipation develops.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xermelo was based on a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter trial conducted in adult patients with a well-differentiated metastatic neuroendocrine tumor and carcinoid syndrome diarrhea who were having between 4 to 12 daily bowel movements despite the use of SSA therapy at a stable dose for at least 3 months. Patients were randomized to placebo or treatment with Xermelo 250 mg three times daily. Study medication was administered within 15 minutes before or within 1 hour after a meal or snack. All patients were required to stay on their baseline SSA regimen and were allowed to use rescue medication (short-acting octreotide) and antidiarrheals for symptomatic relief. A total of 90 patients were evaluated for efficacy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the number of daily bowel movements averaged over the 12-week treatment period. In the 12-week study, a difference in average weekly reductions in bowel movement frequency between Xermelo and placebo was statistically significant and was observed as early as 1 to 3 weeks, and persisted for the remaining 9 weeks of the study.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Xermelo may include, but are not limited to, the following:
nausea
headache
increased GGT
depression
flatulence
decreased appetite
peripheral edema
pyrexia.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Xermelo or carcinoid syndrome diarrhea, please visit http://xermelo.com/","Mechanism of Action
Xermelo (telotristat ethyl) is a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor. Tryptophan hydroxylase mediates the rate limiting step in serotonin biosynthesis. The in vitro inhibitory potency of telotristat towards tryptophan hydroxylase is 29 times higher than that of telotristat ethyl. Serotonin plays a role in mediating secretion, motility, inflammation, and sensation of the gastrointestinal tract, and is over-produced in patients with carcinoid syndrome. Through inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase, telotristat and telotristat ethyl reduce the production of peripheral serotonin, and the frequency of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea.

Chronic Diarrhea,Xifaxan (rifaximin),"General Information
Xifaxan (rifaximin) is a semisynthetic rifamycin derivative and non-systemic gastrointestinal site-specific broad spectrum antibiotic.
Xifaxan is specifically indicated for the treatment of of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) in adults.
Xifaxan is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is one 550 mg tablet taken orally three times a day for 14 days. Patients who experience a recurrence of symptoms can be retreated up to two times with the same dosage regimen.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xifaxan for IBS-D was based on three phase III randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, TARGET-1, -2 and -3.
TARGET-1 and -2
These two trials enrolled a total of 1,258 patients meeting Rome II criteria for IBS who were randomized to receive Xifaxan 550 mg three times a day (n=624) or placebo (n=634) for 14 days and then followed for a 10-week treatment free period. The primary endpoint for both trials was the proportion of patients who achieved adequate relief of IBS signs and symptoms for at least 2 of 4 weeks during the month following 14 days of treatment. Adequate relief of IBS symptoms was experienced by more patients receiving Xifaxan than those receiving placebo during the month following 2 weeks of treatment (SGA-IBS Weekly Results: 41% vs. 31%, p=0.0125; 41% vs. 32%, p=0.0263).
TARGET-3
This trial enrolled 2,579 patients who were scheduled to receive an initial 14-day course of open label Xifaxan followed by 4 weeks of treatment-free follow-up. At the end of the follow-up period, patients were assessed for response to treatment. Responders were then followed for recurrence of their IBS-related symptoms of abdominal pain or mushy/watery stool consistency for up to 20 treatment-free weeks. When patients experienced recurrence of their symptoms of abdominal pain or mushy/ watery stool consistency for 3 weeks of a rolling 4-week period, they were randomized into the double-blind, placebo-controlled repeat treatment phase. Of 1,074 patients who responded to open-label Xifaxan, 382 experienced a period of symptom inactivity or decrease that did not require repeat treatment by the time they discontinued, including patients who completed the 22 weeks after initial treatment with Xifaxan. Overall, 1,257 of 2,579 patients (49%) were nonresponders in the open-label phase and per the study protocol were withdrawn from the study. There were 1,074 (44%) of 2,438 evaluable patients who responded to initial treatment with improvement in abdominal pain and stool consistency. The response rate for each IBS symptom during the open-label phase of Trial 3 is similar to the rates seen in Trials 1 and 2. A total of 636 patients subsequently had sign and symptom recurrence and were randomized to the repeat treatment phase. Patients who responded to treatment with Xifaxan 550 mg but experienced recurrent symptoms responded to repeat treatment in the FDA composite endpoint versus placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Xifaxan for IBS-D may include, but are not limited to, the following:
ALT increased
nausea
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Xifaxan or IBS-D, please visit https://shared.salix.com/shared/pi/xifaxan-pi.pdf","Mechanism of Action
Xifaxan (rifaximin) is a semi-synthetic derivative of rifampin and acts by binding to the betasubunit of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase blocking one of the steps in transcription. This results in inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis and consequently inhibits the growth of bacteria.

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Arzerra (ofatumumab),"General Information
Arzerra (ofatumumab) is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. It targets a membrane-proximal (close to the cell surface), small loop epitope (a portion of a molecule to which an antibody binds) on the CD20 molecule on B-cells. This epitope is different from the binding sites targeted by other CD20 antibodies currently available. The CD20 molecule is a key target in CLL therapy because it is highly expressed in most B-cell malignancies.
Arzerra is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab.
Arzerra is supplied as a liquid concentrate (20 mg/mL) for dilution designed for intravenous administration. The recommended initial dose and schedule is 12 doses administered as follows:
300 mg initial dose (Dose 1), followed 1 week later by
2,000 mg weekly for 7 doses (Doses 2 through 8), followed 4 weeks later by
2,000 mg every 4 weeks for 4 doses (Doses 9 through 12)
Administration
Dose 1: Initiate infusion at a rate of 3.6 mg/hour (12 mL/hour)
Dose 2: Initiate infusion at a rate of 24 mg/hour (12 mL/hour)
Doses 3 through 12: Initiate infusion at a rate of 50 mg/hour (25 mL/hour)
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Arzerra is based on a single-arm, multicenter study in 154 subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL. Arzerra was administered by intravenous infusion according to the following schedule: 300 mg (Week 0), 2,000 mg weekly for 7 infusions (Weeks 1 through 7), and 2,000 mg every 4 weeks for 4 infusions (Weeks 12 through 24). Subjects with CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab comprised the efficacy population. The primary endpoint was objective tumor response rate. The overall response rate was 42%, with a median duration of response of 6.5 months. There were no complete responses. Anti-tumor activity was also observed in additional patients in Study 1 and in a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study (Study 2) conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Arzerra may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Neutropenia
Pneumonia
Pyrexia
Cough
Diarrhea
Anemia
Fatigue
Dyspnea
Rash
Nausea
Bronchitis
Upper respiratory tract infections
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Arzerra or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, please visit the Arzerra web page.","Mechanism of Action
Arzerra is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. It binds specifically to both the small and large extracellular loops of the CD20 molecule. The CD20 molecule is expressed on normal B lymphocytes (pre-B- to mature B-lymphocyte) and on B-cell CLL. The CD20 molecule is not shed from the cell surface and is not internalized following antibody binding. The Fab domain of ofatumumab binds to the CD20 molecule and the Fc domain mediates immune effector functions to result in B-cell lysis in vitro. Data suggest that possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Imbruvica (ibrutinib),"General Information
Imbruvica (ibrutinib) is an orally available, selective inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), a gene that is disrupted in the human disease X-linked agammaglobulenemia (XLA). BTK is a signaling molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways.
Imbruvica is specifically approved for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma and for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma who carry a deletion in chromosome 17 (17p deletion).
Imbruvica is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended dose is 420 mg taken orally once daily (three 140 mg capsules once daily). Capsules should be taken orally with a glass of water. Do not open, break, or chew the capsules.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Imbruvica for chronic lymphocytic leukemia was based on an open-label, multi-center trial of 48 previously treated patients. Imbruvica was administered orally at 420 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) were assessed using a modified version of the International Workshop on CLL Criteria by an Independent Review Committee. The ORR was 58.3%, all partial responses. None of the patients achieved a complete response. The DOR ranged from 5.6 to 24.2+ months. The median DOR was not reached.
The FDA approved of Imbruvica for CLL with 17p deletion was based on a clinical study of 391 previously treated patients, 127 of whom had CLL with 17p deletion. The patients were randomly assigned to receive Imbruvica or Arzerra until disease progression or side effects became intolerable. The trial was stopped early for efficacy after a pre-planned interim analysis showed Imbruvica-treated patients experienced a 78 percent reduction in risk of disease progression or death (progression-free survival). Results also showed a 57 percent reduction in risk of death (overall survival) in patients treated with Imbruvica. Of the 127 patients who had CLL with 17p deletion, those treated with Imbruvica experienced a 75 percent reduction in risk of disease progression or death.
The FDA approval of Imbruvica as a first-line treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) was based on data from the randomized, multi-center, open-label Phase 3 RESONATE-2 (PCYC-1115) trial, which evaluated the use of Imbruvica versus chlorambucil in 269 treatment-naÃ¯ve patients with CLL or SLL aged 65 years or older. Imbruvica significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; primary endpoint) as determined by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), reducing the risk of progression or death by 84% versus chlorambucil; median PFS: not reached for Imbruvica vs. 18.9 months for chlorambucil). Imbruvica was also associated with a significantly higher IRC-assessed overall response rate (ORR: a composite of complete and partial responses; 82.4% vs. 35.3%) versus chlorambucil. Five patients (3.7 percent) in the Imbruvica arm achieved a complete response, compared to two patients (1.5 percent) in the chlorambucil arm.

Treanda contains bendamustine hydrochloride, an alkylating drug. Bendamustine is a bifunctional mechlorethamine derivative containing a purine-like benzimidazole ring. Mechlorethamine and its derivatives form electrophilic alkyl groups. These groups form covalent bonds with electron-rich nucleophilic moieties, resulting in interstrand DNA crosslinks. The bifunctional covalent linkage can lead to cell death via several pathways. Bendamustine is active against both quiescent and dividing cells. However, the exact mechanism of action of bendamustine remains unknown.

Venclexta (venetoclax) is a selective and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, an antiapoptotic protein. Overexpression of BCL-2 has been demonstrated in CLL cells where it mediates tumor cell survival and has been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics. Venetoclax helps restore the process of apoptosis by binding directly to the BCL-2 protein, displacing pro-apoptotic proteins like BIM, triggering mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the activation of caspases.

Zydelig (idelalisib) is a small molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) delta, an intracellular signaling component. PI3K-delta is expressed primarily in blood-cell lineages, including cells that cause or mediate hematologic malignancies.
Zydelig is specifically indicated for the following:
Relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia in combination with rituximab, in patients for whom rituximab alone would be considered appropriate therapy due to other co-morbidities.
Relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.
Relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma in patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies
Zydelig is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended maximum starting dose of Zydelig is 150 mg administered orally twice daily. Zydelig can be taken with or without food. Tablets should be swallowed whole. Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Zydelig was granted regular approval for use in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Accelerated approval was granted for relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (FL) and relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) based on overall response rate. Improvement in patient survival or disease related symptoms has not been established. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
Relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia
Zydelig was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 1) in 220 subjects with relapsed CLL who required treatment and were unable to tolerate standard chemoimmunotherapy. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive 8 doses of rituximab (first dose at 375 mg/m2, subsequent doses at 500 mg/m2 every 2 weeks for 4 infusions and every 4 weeks for an additional 4 infusions) in combination with either an oral placebo twice daily or with Zydelig 150 mg taken twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). The subjects who received Zydelig in combination with rituximab went approximately 11 months without disease pregression, compared to approximately 6 months for subjects given rituximab and a placebo (p < 0.0001).
Relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
A single-arm, multicenter clinical trial enrolled 72 subjects with follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had relapsed within 6 months following rituximab and an alkylating agent and had received at least 2 prior treatments. Subjects received 150 mg of Zydelig orally twice daily until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia,Gleevec (imatinib mesylate),"General Information
Gleevec has been approved for treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in myeloid blast crisis, accelerated phase, or chronic phase, for whom interferon-alpha therapy has failed. It is available in oral capsule formulation. Gleevec is the first anti-cancer drug developed with rational drug design, based on the understanding of how cancer cells work.
CML is caused by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes nine and 22 that results in the ""Philadelphia chromosome"", a known marker for the disease. There are an estimated 4,500 new cases of CML each year in the United States and 2,400 Americans die from the disease annually.
Clinical Results
The response to Gleevec was evaluated in three international, open-label, single-arm, phase II studies in 1,027 patients diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome positive CML. Effectiveness was rated primarily by hematologic response, but cytogenetic response was also measured.
Patients in chronic phase showed a hematologic response of 88% and a cytygenetic response of 49%. The response rates for these two measures were 63% and 21% for those in accelerated phase and 26% and 13.5% in blast crisis.

","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Sprycel may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Hemorrhage (including Gastrointestinal Bleeding)
Fluid Retention (including Pleural Effusion)
Febrile Neutropenia
Infection
Dyspnea
Pneumonia
Pyrexia
Diarrhea
Headache
Musculoskeletal Pain
Myelosuppression was commonly reported, including serious or severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The rate of myelosuppression was higher in patients with accelerated phase or myeloid blast phase CML or lymphoid blast phase Ph+ ALL than in patients with chronic phase CML.
The effectiveness of Sprycel may be affected by concomitant administration of other drugs:
Sprycel is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. Drugs which inhibit this enzyme (including but not limited to ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may affect the pharmacokinetics of Sprycel and increase acute drug exposure. Concomitant administration of these medications should be avoided.
Drugs which induce increased expression of CYP3A4 (including but not limited to dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, and phenobarbital) may reduce levels of Sprycel. Alternative therapies and/or dose Sprycel dose adjustment is recommended.
St. John's wort has been shown to unpredictably decrease Sprycel plasma levels, and should be avoided while on Sprycel therapy.
Sprycel's solubility is Ph dependent. As such, use of antacids within 2 hours before or after Sprycel administration is not recommended.

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia,Synribo (omacetaxine mepesuccinate),"General Information
Synribo (omacetaxine mepesuccinate) is a cephalotaxine ester. It is a protein synthesis inhibitor and is independent of direct Bcr-Abl binding.
Synribo is specifically approved for the treatment of adults with chronic or accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance and/or intolerance to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
Synribo is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is as follows: Induction Schedule: 1.25 mg/m2 administered subcutaneously twice daily for 14 consecutive days every 28 days, over a 28-day cycle. Cycles should be repeated every 28 days until patients achieve a hematologic response. Maintenance Dosing: 1.25 mg/m2 administered subcutaneously twice daily for 7 consecutive days every 28 days, over a 28-day cycle. Treatment should continue as long as patients are clinically benefiting from therapy.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Synribo was based on a combined cohort of adults with CML from two trials. The combined cohort consisted of subjects who had received two or more approved TKIs and had, at a minimum, documented evidence of resistance or intolerance to dasatinib and/or nilotinib. The subjects were treated with omacetaxine mepesuccinate at a dose of 1.25 mg/m2 administered subcutaneously twice daily for 14 consecutive days every 28 days (induction cycle). Responders were then treated with the same dose and twice daily schedule for 7 consecutive days every 28 days (maintenance cycle) for up to 24 months.

Chronic Pain,Avinza (morphine sulfate),"General Information
Avinza was approved by the FDA in March 2002 for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain in patients that require continuous, around-the-clock therapy for an extended period of time. A once-daily dose of Avinza in the extended release capsule formulation provides relief from pain for a 24-hour period. Avinza is available in 30, 60, 90 and 120 mg capsules.
This product was developed by Elan Corporation and will be marketed in the U.S. and Canada by Ligand Pharmaceuticals.
Clinical Results
Controlled and open-label clinical trials were conducted to test the safety and efficacy of Avinza. A total of approximately 140 healthy subjects and 560 subjects with chronic, moderate-to-severe pain from malignant and non-malignant disease sources were involved in these studies. The duration of the controlled clinical studies ranged from seven days to up to four weeks. Subjects in the open-label studies were observed for six to 12 months.
In one study, 295 subjects with chronic pain from osteoarthritis received either placebo or once-daily treatment with Avinza 30 mg in the morning or evening. Results showed that Avinza was significantly more effective at reducing pain than placebo.
Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that the amount of morphine absorbed from Avinza extended-release formulation was similar to that absorbed from other oral morphine formulations. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of Avinza were shown to be dose-proportional for both healthy subjects and subjects with moderate-to-severe pain.

Chronic Pain,Belbuca (buprenorphine),"General Information
Belbuca buccal film contains buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist.
Belbuca is specifically indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.
Belbuca is supplied as a buccal film for oral administration. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patientâ€™s severity of pain, response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. Iitiate treatment in opioid naÃ¯ve patients with a 75 mcg film once daily or, if tolerated, every 12 hours for at least 4 days, then increase dose to 150 mcg every 12 hours. Individual titration to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions should proceed in increments of 150 mcg every 12 hours, no more frequently than every 4 days. Doses up to 450 mcg every 12 hours were studied in opioid naÃ¯ve patients in the clinical trials.
Please see drug label foe dosing in specific populations, conversions from other analgesics/opioids and titrations and maintenance dosing.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Belbuca was based on three 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in opioid-naÃ¯ve and opioid-experienced patients with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain using pain scores as the primary efficacy variable. Two of these studies demonstrated efficacy in patients with low back pain. One study in low back pain did not show a statistically significant pain reduction for Belbuca compared to placebo.
12-Week Study in Opioid-NaÃ¯ve Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain
A total of 749 patients with chronic low back pain entered an open-label, dose-titration period for up to eight weeks. Patients initiated therapy with a single 75 mcg dose of Belbuca on Day 1 and continued taking Belbuca 75 mcg either once daily or every 12 hours for 4-8 days as tolerated. The dose was then increased to 150 mcg every 12 hours, and patients could continue to dose escalate in 150 mcg dose increments every 4-8 days for up to 6 weeks if the adverse effects were tolerable and the analgesic effects were not adequate. Patients who achieved adequate analgesia and tolerable adverse effects on Belbuca for at least 2 weeks were then randomized to continue their titrated dose of Belbuca or matching placebo. Sixty-one percent (61%) of the patients who entered the open-label dose titration period were able to titrate to a tolerable and effective dose and were randomized into a 12-week, double-blind treatment period.
During the first 2 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients were allowed up to 2 tablets per day of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg as supplemental analgesia to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in patients randomized to placebo. Thereafter, the supplemental analgesia was limited to 1 to 2 tablets of acetaminophen 500 mg per day. Seventy-six percent of the patients treated with Belbuca completed the 12-week treatment compared to 73% of the patients treated with placebo. Of the 209 patients randomized to Belbuca, 4% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 8% due to adverse events. Of the 211 patients randomized to placebo, 11% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 4% due to adverse events.
Of the patients who were randomized, the mean pain (SD) scores on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) were 7.1 (1.06) and 7.2 (1.05) prior to open-label titration and 2.8 (1.01) and 2.8 (1.12) at the beginning of the double-blind period for Belbuca and placebo, respectively. The change from double-blind baseline to week 12 in mean pain (SD) NRS score was statistically significant favoring patients treated with Belbuca, compared with patients treated with placebo. A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (62%) had at least a 30% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint when compared to patients who received placebo buccal film (47%). A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (41%) also had at least a 50% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint compared to patients who received placebo (33%).
12-Week Study in Opioid-Experienced Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain
Eight hundred and ten (810) patients on chronic opioid therapy (total daily dose 30-160 mg in oral morphine sulfate equivalents (MSE) for at least 4 weeks) entered an open-label, dose-titration period with Belbuca for up to 8 weeks, following taper of their prior opioids to 30 mg oral MSE daily. Patients were initiated with Belbuca150 mcg every 12 hours if they were on 30 to 89 mg oral MSE daily and 300 mcg every 12 hours if they were on 90 to160 mg oral MSE daily prior to taper. If a patient tolerated the adverse events and the analgesic effects were not adequate, the dose was increased in increments of 150 mcg every 12 hours after 4 to 8 days for up to 6 weeks. Patients were permitted to take hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg as analgesic rescue as needed up to a maximum of 4 doses per day during the open-label dose titration period. After a dose was reached with adequate analgesia and tolerable adverse effects for a period of 2 weeks, patients were randomized to continue their titrated dose of Belbuca or matching placebo. Sixty-three percent (63%) of the patients who entered the open-label titration period were able to titrate to a tolerable and effective dose and were randomized into a 12-week double-blind treatment phase. Ten percent (10%) of patients discontinued due to an adverse event, 8% discontinued due to lack of a therapeutic effect, and 0.1% discontinued due to opioid withdrawal during the open-label titration period. The remaining 20% of patients discontinued due to various non drug related administrative reasons.
During the double-blind period, patients were permitted to take up to 2 doses of 5/325 mg or 10/650 mg of hydrocodone/acetaminophen per day for the first 2 weeks to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in patients randomized to placebo. After the first 2 weeks, patients were permitted to take 1 dose of 5/325 mg or 10/650 mg per day. Eighty-three percent of patients treated with Belbuca and 57% of patients treated with placebo buccal film completed the 12-week treatment period. Of the 243 patients randomized to Belbuca, 8% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 2% due to adverse events. Of the 248 patients randomized to placebo buccal film, 25% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 5% due to adverse events.
Of the patients who were randomized into the double-blind period, the mean pain (SD) NRS scores were 6.8 (1.28) and 6.6 (1.32) prior to open-label titration and 2.9 (0.985) and 2.8 (1.05) at the beginning of the double-blind period for Belbuca and placebo, respectively. The change from baseline to week 12 in mean pain (SD) NRS score was statistically significant in favor of patients treated with Belbuca compared with patients treated with placebo. A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (64%) had at least a 30% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint when compared to patients who received placebo buccal film (31%). A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (39%) also had at least a 50% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint compared to patients who received placebo (17%).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Belbuca may include, but are not limited to, the following:
nausea
constipation
headache
vomiting
dizziness
somnolence
Belbuca comes with the following boxed warning:
Belbuca exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patientâ€™s risk before prescribing, and monitor regularly for development of these behaviors or conditions.
Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or following a dose increase. Instruct patients on proper administration of Belbuca to reduce the risk.
Accidental exposure to Belbuca, especially in children, can result in fatal overdose of buprenorphine.
Prolonged use of Belbuca during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.

Conversion from Other Opioids to Butrans
Patientâ€™s current around-the-clock opioids sould be tapered for up to 7 days to no more than 30 mg of morphine or equivalent per day before beginning treatment with Butrans. For patients whose daily dose was less than 30 mg of oral morphine or equivalent, initiate treatment with Butrans 5 mcg/hour. For patients whose daily dose was 30 and 80 mg morphine equivalents, initiate treatment with Butrans 10 mcg/hour. Thereafter, individually titrate at minimum intervals of 72 hours. The maximum dose is 20 mcg/hour.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval was based on four 12-week double-blind, controlled clinical trials in opioid-naÃ¯ve and opioid-experienced patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain or osteoarthritis. Two of these studies, seen below, demonstrated efficacy in patients with low back pain. One study in low back pain failed to show efficacy. One study in osteoarthritis, that included an active comparator, failed to show efficacy for Butrans and the active comparator.
12-Week Study in Opioid-NaÃ¯ve Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain
A total of 1,024 patients with chronic low back pain who were suboptimally responsive to their non-opioid therapy entered an open-label, dose-titration period for up to four weeks. Patients initiated therapy with three days of treatment with Butrans 5 mcg/hour. After three days, if adverse events were tolerated but the pain persisted (=5 on an 11-point, 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale), the dose was increased to Butrans 10 mcg/hour. If adverse effects were tolerated but adequate analgesia was not reached, the dose was increased to Butrans 20 mcg/hour for an additional 10-12 days. Patients who achieved adequate analgesia and tolerable adverse effects on Butrans were then randomized to remain on their titrated dose of Butrans or matching placebo. Of the patients who entered the open-label titration period, 53% were able to titrate to a tolerable and effective dose and were randomized into a 12-week, double-blind treatment period. The score for average pain over the last 24 hours at the end of the study (Week 12/Early Termination) was statistically significantly lower for patients treated with Butrans compared with patients treated with placebo.
12-Week Study in Opioid-Experienced Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain
A total of 1,160 patients on chronic opioid therapy (total daily dose 30-80 mg morphine equivalent) entered an open-label, dose-titration period with Butrans for up to 3 weeks, following taper of prior opioids. Patients initiated therapy with Butrans 10 mcg/hour for three days. After three days, if the patient tolerated the adverse effects, the dose was increased to Butrans 20 mcg/hour for up to 18 days. Patients with adequate analgesia and tolerable adverse effects on Butrans 20 mcg/hour were randomized to remain on Butrans 20 mcg/hour or were switched to a low-dose control (Butrans 5 mcg/hour) or an active control. Of the subjects who entered the open-label titration period, 57% were able to titrate to and tolerate the adverse effects of Butrans 20 mcg/hour and were randomized into a 12-week double-blind treatment phase. The score for average pain over the last 24 hours at Week 12 was statistically significantly lower for subjects treated with Butrans 20 mcg/hour compared to subjects treated with Butrans 5 mcg/hour.

Targiniq ER is specifically indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. It is not indicated for use as-needed (prn) analgesic. Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release opioid formulations, reserve Targiniq ER for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequete.
Targiniq ER is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. For opioid-naÃ¯ve and opioid non-tolerant patients, initiate with 10 mg/5 mg tablets orally every 12 hours.
Crushing, chewing, or dissolving Targiniq ER tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can lead to overdose or death.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Targiniq ER was based on one 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in opioid-experienced patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe chronic low back pain. A total of 1,095 subjects with uncontrolled moderate to severe chronic low back pain entered an open-label, dose-titration period for up to four weeks. Patients initiated Targiniq ER therapy at an oxycodone dose approximately equivalent to their current therapy. The dose of Targiniq ER could be up-titrated to a maximum of 40/20 mg twice daily by the investigator every 1-2 days as needed based on efficacy, safety, and tolerability considerations or down-titrated at any time for safety and/or tolerability reasons. During open-label titration, subjects were allowed supplemental pain medication (immediate-release oxycodone HCl 5 mg capsules) for low back pain every 4 hours as needed up to 8 capsules per day. Fifty-five percent (55%) of patients who entered the open-label titration period achieved adequate analgesia and tolerability on TARGINIQ ER and were then randomized to their final titrated dose of Targiniq ER or matching placebo for 12 weeks of double-blind treatment. During the double-blind period, subjects were allowed one capsule of supplemental pain medication as needed, up to two capsules per day. Of the 298 patients randomized to Targiniq ER, 73% of the patients completed the 12-week double-blind treatment on study drug. Of the 302 patients randomized to placebo, 60% of the patients completed the study. Fewer patients randomized to Targiniq ER discontinued due to lack of efficacy compared to placebo, 10% versus 24%. Discontinuation due to adverse events was the same for both groups.

Targiniq is a combination product consisting of oxycodone, an opioid agonist, and naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Oxycodone hydrochloride is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Naloxone is an antagonist acting on mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral organs (e.g, intestine, heart, kidney, and lungs). Naloxone antagonizes opioid effects by competing for the mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptor sites with the greatest affinity for the mu receptor.

Conversion from Other Opioids to Troxyca ER: Discontinue all other around -the-clock opioid drugs when Troxyca ER therapy is initiated.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The analgesic efficacy of Troxyca ER was evaluated in one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain. This study utilized an enriched-enrollment, randomized-withdrawal design and was conducted in a population consisting of both opioid-experienced and opioid-naÃ¯ve subjects. Subjects were titrated to effect with Troxyca ER in the open-label period, which was followed by a 12-week double-blind treatment period. Total daily doses of the oxycodone in Troxyca ER ranged from 20 mg to 160 mg administered in two equal doses approximately 12 hours apart. Subjects with controlled pain (defined as pain intensity numerical rating scale [NRS] â‰¤4) were randomized into the 12-week double-blind treatment period to either continue Troxyca ER or be switched to placebo. Subjects randomized to placebo were given a blinded taper of Troxyca ER according to a pre-specified schedule to prevent opioid withdrawal. Rescue medication (up to 3 grams per day of acetaminophen) was allowed throughout the study to treat episodes of breakthrough pain. Immediate-release oxycodone HCl (as a single ingredient product) was also allowed during the first 3 weeks of the open-label period to manage the initial conversion from prior therapy.
A total of 410 subjects entered the open-label titration period and 281 were successfully titrated onto Troxyca ER and randomized into the double-blind treatment period: 134 to placebo and 147 to Troxyca ER. Of these, 42.5% of subjects were previously treated with an opioid. The mean change in the weekly average pain intensity NRS scores from randomization baseline to the average of Weeks 11 and 12 was statistically significantly superior for those treated with Troxyca ER compared to placebo. A higher percentage of subjects receiving Troxyca ER, compared to placebo, had a â‰¥30% decrease in their weekly average NRS-pain intensity scores from Screening to Weeks 11 and 12 of the double-blind treatment period (58% versus 44% for Troxyca ER and placebo, respectively), while, 40% of subjects receiving Troxyca ER and 30% of subjects receiving placebo had a 50% decrease.
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions associated with the use of Troxyca ER may include, but are not limited to, the following:
nausea
constipation
vomiting
headache
somnolence
Troxyca ER comes with a Black Box warning of the potential for Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, Accidental ingestion, neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) can result in fatal overdose of oxycodone from Troxyca ER.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Troxyca ER or severe pain, please visit http://www.pfizer.com/","Mechanism of Action
Troxyca ER is an extended release capsule formulation of oxycodone combined with naltrexone. Oxycodone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that reverses the subjective and analgesic effects of mu-opioid receptor agonists by competitively binding at mu-opioid receptors.

Colorectal Cancer,Avastin (bevacizumab),"General Information
Avastin is an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody for the treatment of solid tumors.
Avastin, used in combination with intravenous 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy, is indicated for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum.
The recommended dose of Avastin is 5 mg/kg given once every 14 days as an IV infusion until disease progression is detected.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Avastin for colorectal cancer was based on two (STUDY 1 / STUDY 2) randomized, controlled trials in combination with intravenous 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy.
Study 1 was a double-blind trial enrolling 813 subjects with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. Subjects were randomized to bolus-IFL (irinotecan 125 mg/m2 IV, 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 IV, and leucovorin 20 mg/m2 IV given once weekly for 4 weeks every 6 weeks) plus placebo (Arm 1), bolus-IFL plus Avastin (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) (Arm 2) or 5-FU/LV plus Avastin (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) (Arm 3). Among the subjects, 57% had an ECOG performance status of 0. The primary endpoint of this trial was overall survival. Results showed that the overall survival in Arms 1 & 2 was 20.3 months with Avastin compared with 15.6 months with placebo. The median progression-free survival was 10.6 months with Avastin compared with 6.4 months with placebo. Data showed that the median overall survival in Arm 3 was 18.3 months, median progression-free survival was 8.8 months, overall response rate was 39%, and median duration of response was 8.5 months.
Study 2 tested Avastin in combination with 5-FU/LV and enrolled as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Subjects were randomized to receive 5-FU/LV (5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, leucovorin 500 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks every 8 weeks) or 5-FU/LV plus Avastin (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or 5-FU/LV plus Avastin (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). The primary endpoints of the trial were objective response rate and progression-free survival. Results showed that progression-free survival was significantly better in subjects receiving 5-FU/LV plus Avastin at 5 mg/kg when compared to those not receiving Avastin. However, overall survival and overall response rate were not significantly different. Results for subjects receiving 5-FU/LV plus Avastin at 10 mg/kg were not significantly different than without Avastin.

Bevacizumab binds VEGF and prevents the interaction of VEGF to its receptors (Flt-1 and KDR) on the surface of endothelial cells. The interaction of VEGF with its receptors leads to endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation in in vitro models of angiogenesis.
In preclinical studies, administration of bevacizumab to xenotransplant models of colon cancer in nude mice caused reduction of microvascular growth and inhibition of metastatic disease progression. In January 2000, preclinical results showed that bevacizumab was more effective at preventing growth of tumor cell lines in animal models when it was combined with sub-threshold doses of cisplatin or trastuzumab.

Colorectal Cancer,CEA-Scan,"General Information
CEA is expressed by more than 90% of colorectal cancers, as well as by a large number of other carcinomas, including esophageal, stomach, lung, breast, pancreas, uterus, and ovarian cancer. It has been shown that this tumor marker can serve as a useful target for radiolabeled antibodies. Since CEA-Scan uses a small antibody fragment at a low dose, there is virtually no immune reaction by subjects to the foreign protein. In addition, linking the fragment with technetium-99m, a common radioisotope in nuclear medicine, permits tumor detection within a few hours, using conventional gamma cameras.

Colorectal Cancer,Erbitux (cetuximab),"General Information
Erbitux (cetuximab) for injection is a monoclonal antibodyt hat targets and inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr). EGFr is over-expressed in more than 35% of all solid malignant tumors. It is used alone or combination with other therapies for the treatment of colorectal cancer.
Erbitux is indicated, in combination with irinotecan, for the treatment of EGFR-expressing, metastatic colorectal cancer in patients who are refractory to irinotecan-based chemotherapy. In addition, it is also approved for use as a single agent in the treatment of patients with EGFR-expressing, metastatic colorectal cancer who are intolerant to irinotecan-based chemotherapy.
The recommended dosage of Erbitux is 400 mg/m2 as an initial loading dose, administered as a 120-minute IV infusion. The recommended weekly maintenance dose is 250 mg/m2 infused over 60 minutes.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Erbitux was based on three separate clinical trials on subjects with EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer, whose disease had progressed after receiving an irinotecan-containing regimen.
A randomized, controlled trial enrolling 329 subjects investigated Erbitux both as a monotherapy and in combination with irinotecan. Subjects received Erbitux plus irinotecan or Erbitux monotherapy, administered as a 400 mg/m2 initial dose, followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Eighty-eight percent of subjects had baseline Karnofsky Performance Status of 80 or higher. Fifty-eight percent of subjects had colon cancer and 40% rectal cancer with two-thirds of them having previously failed oxaliplatin treatment. Data showed that the median duration of response in the overall population was 5.7 months in the combination arm and 4.2 months in the monotherapy arm. Analysis showed that subjects randomized to Erbitux and irinotecan demonstrated a significantly longer median time to disease progression compared with Erbitux alone.
An open-label, single-arm trial enrolling 138 subjects investigated Erbitux in combination with irinotecan. Subjects received a 20-mg test dose of Erbitux on day 1, followed by a 400-mg/m2 initial dose, and 250 mg/m2 weekly until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Seventy-four subjects had documented progression to irinotecan. Results demonstrated an overall response rate of 15% for the overall population and 12% for the irinotecan-failure population. The median durations of response were 6.5 and 6.7 months, respectively. In a third trial, Erbitux was studied as a single agent in a open-label, single-arm study enrolling 57 subjects. Results showed an overall response rate of 9% for the all-treated group and 14% for the irinotecan-failure group. The median times to progression were 1.4 and 1.3 months, respectively.

Please Visit Inspire's Community Pages for this drug.","Mechanism of Action
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD 1)-blocking, humanized monoclonal IgG4 kappa antibody. Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response.

Colorectal Cancer,Vectibix (panitumumab),"General Information
Vectibix is a recombinant, human IgG2 kappa monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). Overexpression of EGFR is detected in many human cancers, including those of the colon and rectum. When Vectibix binds to EGFR it competitively inhibits the binding of ligands for EGFR. This results in inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine and vascular growth factor production.
Vectibix is specifically indicated for for the treatment of EGFR-expressing, metastatic colorectal carcinoma with disease progression on or following fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan- containing chemotherapy regimens.
Vectibix is supplied as a sterile, colorless, preservative-free solution containing 20 mg/mL designed for intravenous infusion. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 6 mg/kg administered over 60 minutes as an intravenous infusion every 14 days. If safety or tolerability concerns arise, dosage may be reduced by 50%. Doses higher than 1000 mg should be infused over 90 minutes.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Vectibix was based on the results of one clinical trial. This open-label, multinational, randomized, controlled trial enrolled 463 subjects with EGFR-expressing, metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum (mCRC). Subjects were randomized to receive Vectibix at a dose of 6 mg/kg given once every 2 weeks plus best supportive care (BSC) (n = 231) or BSC alone (n = 232) until disease progression. Statistical significance was seen in prolongation of progression free survival for the subjects treated with Vectibix versus those treated with BSC alone, with a mean of 96 days versus 60 days, respectively.

Grastek is specifically indicated for use in subjects ages 5 through 65 years as immunotherapy for the treatment of grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis confirmed by positive skin test or in vitro testing for pollen-specific IgE antibodies for Timothy grass or cross-reactive grass pollens.
Grastek is is supplied as a tablet for sublingual (under the tongue) administration. The recommended dose is one tablet daily. The first dose should be administered in a healthcare setting under the supervision of a physician with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases. The patient should be observed for at least 30 minutes to monitor for signs or symptoms of a severe systemic or a severe local allergic reaction. If the patient tolerates the first dose, subsequent doses may be taken at home. Treatment should be initiated at least 12 weeks before the expected onset of each grass pollen season and continue treatment throughout the season.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Grastek in the treatment of allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis in Timothy grass pollen allergic subjects 5 years of age and older, with or without mild asthma, was evaluated during the first grass pollen season in two trials of approximately 24 weeks treatment duration. The sustained effect of Grastek was evaluated in one trial conducted over 5 grass pollen seasons. All three trials were randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials. Subjects had a history of grass pollen induced rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis and sensitivity to Timothy grass pollen as determined by specific testing (IgE). In these three studies, subjects initiated Grastek or placebo approximately 12 weeks prior to the pollen season. In the long-term study, subjects received Grastek or placebo daily for 3 consecutive years and were followed for 2 years without treatment. Subjects were allowed to take symptom relieving medications. Efficacy was established by self-reporting of rhinoconjunctivitis daily symptom scores (DSS) and daily medication scores (DMS). Daily rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms included four nasal symptoms (runny nose, stuffy nose, sneezing, and itchy nose), and two ocular symptoms (gritty/itchy eyes and watery eyes). The rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms were measured on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The sums of the DSS and DMS were combined into the Total Combined Score (TCS) which was averaged over the entire grass pollen season.
First Season Efficacy
Adults and Children
This placebo-controlled trial evaluated 1,501 subjects 5 through 65 years of age and compared Grastek to placebo administered as a sublingual tablet daily for approximately 24 weeks. TCS score over Entire season: Grastek: 3.24 versus placebo: 4.22. TCS score over Peak season: Grastek: 3.33 versus placebo: 4.22.
Children
This double-blind clinical trial of approximately 24 weeks duration evaluated 344 pediatric subjects 5 to 17 years of age who were treated with either Grastek or placebo once daily. TCS score for Grastek: 4.62 versus for placebo: 6.25.

Constipation,Ibsrela (tenapanor),"General Information
Ibsrela (tenapanor) is a sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) inhibitor.
Ibsrela is specifically indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in adults.
Ibsrela is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dosage in adults is 50 mg orally twice daily. Take Ibsrela immediately prior to breakfast or the first meal of the day and immediately prior to dinner. If a dose is missed, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take 2 doses at the same time.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ibsrela was based on two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The trial designs were identical through the first 12 weeks of treatment, and thereafter differed in that Trial 1 continued for an additional 14 weeks of treatment (26 weeks double-blind treatment), whereas Trial 2 included a 4-week randomized withdrawal (RW) period (12 weeks double-blind treatment). Patients who were enrolled in these trials met the Rome III criteria for IBS-C, related to abdominal pain and bowel movement frequency. The primary endpoint for both trials was the proportion of patients who were responders during the 12-week treatment period. A responder, as defined by the FDA, was a patient who experienced at least a 30% reduction in the weekly average abdominal pain score compared with baseline and an increase of at least 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) in weekly average from baseline, in the same week, for at least 6 of the first 12 treatment weeks. In both trials Ibsrela met the primary endpoint as compared with placebo (Trial 1: 37% versus 24%, Ibsrela versus placebo, respectively. Trial 2: 27% versus 19% Ibsrela versus placebo, respectively). In Trials 1 and 2, the proportion of responders for 9 out of the first 12 weeks, including at least 3 of the last 4 weeks, was greater in Ibsrela-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In addition, in Trial 1, the proportion of responders for 13 out of 26 weeks was greater in Ibsrelaâ€‘treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In both trials, improvements from baseline in average weekly CSBMs and abdominal pain were observed by Week 1, with improvement maintained through the end of treatment.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Ibsrela may include, but are not limited to, the following:
diarrhea
abdominal distension
flatulence
dizziness
The Ibsrela drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning: Ibsrela is contraindicated in patients less than 6 years of age; in young juvenile rats, tenapanor caused death presumed to be due to dehydration. Avoid use of Ibsrela in patients 6 years to less than 12 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of Ibsrela have not been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Ibsrela or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in adults, please visit the Ardelyx web page.","Mechanism of Action
Ibsrela (tenapanor) is a locally acting inhibitor of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3), an antiporter expressed on the apical surface of the small intestine and colon primarily responsible for the absorption of dietary sodium. In vitro and animal studies indicate its major metabolite, M1, is not active against NHE3. By inhibiting NHE3 on the apical surface of the enterocytes, tenapanor reduces absorption of sodium from the small intestine and colon, resulting in an increase in water secretion into the intestinal lumen, which accelerates intestinal transit time and results in a softer stool consistency. Tenapanor has also been shown to reduce abdominal pain by decreasing visceral hypersensitivity and by decreasing intestinal permeability in animal models. In rat model of colonic hypersensitivity, tenapanor reduced visceral hyperalgesia and normalized colonic sensory neuronal excitability.

Constipation,Linzess (linaclotide),"General Information
Linzess (linaclotide) is a guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) agonist. Activation of GC-C results in an increase in both intracellular and extracellular concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Elevation in intracellular cGMP stimulates secretion of chloride and bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen, resulting in increased intestinal fluid and accelerated transit.
Linzess is specifically indicated for the treatment of adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and for adults with chronic idiopathic constipation.
Linzess is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose of Linzess for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation is 290 mcg taken orally once daily on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes prior to the first meal of the day. The recommended dose of Linzess for chronic idiopathic constipation is 145 mcg taken orally once daily on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes prior to the first meal of the day.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Linzess for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation was based on two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter trials, Trial 1 (n=800) and Trial 2 (n=804). All subjects met the Rome II criteria for IBS. The subjects received Linzess 290 mcg or placebo. The trial designs were identical through the first 12 weeks, and thereafter differed only in that Trial 1 included a 4-week randomized withdrawal (RW) period, and Trial 2 continued for 14 additional weeks (total of 26 weeks) of double-blind treatment. During the trials, subjects were allowed to continue stable doses of bulk laxatives or stool softeners. The four primary efficacy responder endpoints were based on a patient being a weekly responder for either at least 9 out of the first 12 weeks of treatment or at least 6 out of the first 12 weeks of treatment:
For the 9 out of 12 weeks combined primary responder endpoint, a subject had to have at least a 30% reduction from baseline in mean abdominal pain, at least three complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) and an increase of at least one CSBM from baseline, all in the same week, for at least 9 out of the first 12 weeks of treatment. Each of the two components of the 9 out of 12 weeks combined responder endpoint, abdominal pain and CSBMs, was also a primary endpoint.
For the 6 out of 12 weeks combined primary responder endpoint, a subject had to have at least a 30% reduction from baseline in mean abdominal pain and an increase of at least one CSBM from baseline, all in the same week, for at least 6 out of the first 12 weeks of treatment. To be considered a responder for this analysis, subjects did not have to have at least three CSBMs per week.
In both trials, the proportion of subjects who were responders to Linzess 290 mcg was statistically significantly higher than with placebo.
Efficacy Responder Rates: at Least 9 Out of 12 Weeks:
Trial 1 combined responder endpoint: Linzess: 12.1% responders vs. placebo: 5.1% responders. Trial 2 combined responder endpoint: Linzess: 12.7% responders vs. placebo: 3.0% responders.
Efficacy Responder Rates: at Least 6 Out of 12 Weeks:
Trial 1 combined responder endpoint: Linzess: 33.6% responders vs. placebo: 21.0% responders. Trial 2 combined responder endpoint: Linzess: 33.7% responders vs. placebo: 13.9% responders.
In both trials improvement from baseline in abdominal pain and CSBM frequency was seen over the first 12-weeks of the treatment period. For change from baseline in the 11-point abdominal pain scale, Linzess 290 mcg began to separate from placebo in the first week. Maximum effects were seen at weeks 6 - 9 and were maintained until the end of the study. The mean treatment difference from placebo at week 12 was a decrease in pain score of approximately 1.0 point in both trials (using an 11-point scale). Maximum effect on CSBM frequency occurred within the first week, and for change from baseline in CSBM frequency at week 12, the difference between placebo and Linzess was approximately 1.5 CSBMs per week in both trials. During the 4-week randomized withdrawal period in Trial 1, subjects who received Linzess during the 12-week treatment period were re-randomized to receive placebo or continue treatment on Linzess 290 mcg. In the Linzess-treated arm re-randomized to placebo, CSBM frequency and abdominal-pain severity returned toward baseline within 1 week and did not result in worsening compared to baseline. Subjects who continued on Linzess maintained their response to therapy over the additional 4 weeks. Subjects on placebo who were allocated to Linzess had an increase in CSBM frequency and abdominal pain levels that were similar to the levels observed in patients taking Linzess during the treatment period.
The FDA approval of Linzess for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation was based on two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials, Trial 3 (n=642) and Trial 4 (n=630). All subjects met modified Rome II criteria for functional constipation. The subjects received Linzess 145 mcg, 290 mcg, or placebo once daily. The trial designs were identical through the first 12 weeks. Trial 3 also included an additional 4-week randomized withdrawal (RW) period. During the trials, subjects were allowed to continue stable doses of bulk laxatives or stool softeners. Efficacy of Linzess was assessed using overall responder analysis and change-from-baseline endpoints. A CSBM overall responder in the CIC trials was defined as a subject who had at least three CSBMs and an increase of at least one CSBM from baseline in a given week for at least 9 weeks out of the 12-week treatment period. In Trials 3 and 4, the proportion of subjects who were CSBM responders was statistically significantly greater with the Linzess 145 mcg dose than with placebo. Linzess 290 mcg did not consistently offer additional clinically meaningful treatment benefit over placebo than that observed with the 145 mcg dose. The following data is for the approved 145 mcg dose of Linzess:
CSBM Overall Responder at Least 9 Out of 12 Weeks:
Trial 3: Linzess 145 mcg: 20.3% responders vs. placebo 3.3% responders. Trial 4: Linzess 145 mcg: 15.5% responders vs. placebo 5.6% responders.
In both trials CSBM frequency reached maximum level during week 1 and was also demonstrated over the remainder of the 12-week treatment period. For the mean change from baseline in CSBM frequency at week 12, the difference between placebo and Linzess was approximately 1.5 CSBMs. In both trials, Linzess also resulted in significantly greater improvements compared with placebo in stool frequency and stool consistency. During the 4-week randomized withdrawal period in Trial 3, subjects who received Linzess during the 12-week treatment period were re-randomized to receive placebo or continue treatment on the same dose of Linzess taken during the treatment period. In Linzess-treated patients re-randomized to placebo, CSBM and SBM frequency returned toward baseline within 1 week and did not result in worsening compared to baseline. Subjects who continued on Linzess maintained their response to therapy over the additional four weeks. Subjects on placebo who were allocated to Linzess had an increase in CSBM and SBM frequency similar to the levels observed in subjects taking Linzess during the treatment period.

Constipation,Trulance (plecanatide),"General Information
Trulance (plecanatide) is a guanylate cyclase-C agonist. Plecanatide binds to and activates guanylate cyclase C (GC-C) expressed on epithelial cells lining the GI mucosa, resulting in activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and leading to augmented flow of chloride and water into the lumen of the gut, facilitating bowel movement.
Trulance is specifically indicated for use in adults for treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation.
Trulance is supplied as tablets for oral administration. The recommended dose is 3 mg taken orally once daily, with or without food. For adults with swallowing difficulties, Trulance tablets can be crushed and administered orally either in applesauce or with water or administered with water via a nasogastric or gastric feeding tube. Mixing Trulance crushed tablets in other soft foods or in other liquids has not been tested.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Trulance was based on two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical studies in adult patients (Study 1 and Study 2). In the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population, a total of 905 patients (Study 1) and 870 patients (Study 2) were randomized 1:1 to either placebo or Trulance 3 mg, once daily. Over 12 weeks, patients treated with Trulance achieved a significantly greater efficacy responder rate â€” the primary endpoint defined by the FDA for regulatory approval in CIC â€” in both studies compared to placebo (Study 1: 21% vs. 10%; Study 2: 21% vs. 13%, p<0.005 for both studies). Efficacy responders were defined as patients who had at least three complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) in a given week and an increase of at least one CSBM over baseline in the same week for at least nine weeks out of the 12-week period, including at least three of the last four weeks.

Contraception,ella (ulipristal acetate),"General Information
ella (ulipristal acetate) is a synthetic progesterone agonist/antagonist. When taken immediately before ovulation is to occur, ella postpones follicular rupture. The likely primary mechanism of action of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is therefore inhibition or delay of ovulation; however, alterations to the endometrium that may affect implantation may also contribute to efficacy.
ella is specifically indicated as an emergency contraceptive for prevention of pregnancy following unprotected intercourse or a known or suspected contraceptive failure.
ella is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is one tablet taken orally as soon as possible, within 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse or a known or suspected contraceptive failure.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of ella was based on two studies: an open label study and a single-blind comparative study.
Open label study
This trial enrolled 1,242 healthy female subjects with a mean age of 24 years who requested emergency contraception 48 to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. The subjects received 30 mg of ella. ella statistically significantly reduced the pregnancy rate, from an expected rate of 5.5% to an observed rate of 2.2% (27 pregnancies).
Single blind study
This multicenter, single-blind, randomized trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of 30 mg ella to levonorgestrel (another form of emergency contraception). The trial enrolled 844 female subjects with a mean age of 25 years who requested emergency contraception within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse. The subjects received ella or levonorgestrel 1.5 mg. ella statistically significantly reduced the pregnancy rate, from an expected 5.6% to an observed 1.9%, when taken within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. There were no pregnancies observed in the women who were administered ella more than 72 hours after unprotected intercourse (10% of women who received ella).
Pooled analysis
Data from the two studies were pooled to provide a total efficacy population of women treated with ulipristal acetate up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. Time Trend analysis for the five 24-hour intervals from 0 to 120 hours between unprotected intercourse and treatment was conducted. There were no significant differences in the observed pregnancy rates across the five time intervals.

Estrostep works by providing low, gradually increasing amounts of estrogen (20, 30, 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol) with a low, constant dose of progestin (one mg norethindrone acetate).
Monophasic birth control pills contain a constant doe of estrogen and progestin. Triphasics change the dose of progestin throughout the cycle while keeping the estrogen dose constant or increasing then decreasing the estrogen dose. This is the first OC that gradually phases in the estrogen component of the pill in increasing doses. With Estrostep, low doses of estrogen are phased into the womanâ€™s body in three graduated steps during the menstrual cycle: 20 micrograms (mcg) of estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) for the first five days, 30 mcg for the next seven days, and 35 mcg for the last nine days, for a total of 21 days. Estrogen and progestin are stopped for the remaining seven days of the cycle, resulting in a womanâ€™s monthly menstrual period. The 28-day pill pack will contain seven inactive tablets to help women maintain their regimen.
When used as directed, Estrostep is greater than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy , as are all other combination Ocs.
Clinical Results
Estrostep was found to be well-tolerated in a clinical study involving 1,200 patients (769 receiving Estrostep), with a low overall drop-out rate due to side effects.
","Side Effects
In addition to contraception, Estrostep, like all oral contraceptives, may also provide several health benefits including: lower incidence of ovarian cysts, lower incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease, reduced likelihood of developing cancer of the ovaries and cancer of the lining of the uterus, more regular periods, lighter menstrual flow and less menstrual discomfort.
However, all Ocs are also associated with certain side effects. Nausea/vomiting, breakthrough bleeding and headaches are common. Clinical studies with Estrostep showed that these side effects as well as weight gain each caused fewer than one percent of women to withdraw from therapy.
","Additional Information
The most common pill prescribed today contains a constant 35 mcg estrogen dose. Early generation pills contained doses of estrogen as high as 150 mcg. Studies linking high doses of the hormone to adverse effects have resulted in a progressive reduction of estrogen content, leading to todayâ€™s low-dose pills.
Oral contraceptives are not appropriate for all patients. The use of oral contraceptives is associated with some serious adverse side effects as well, such as increased risk of myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, stroke, hepatic neoplasia, and gallbladder disease. The risk of serious morbidity and mortality is very small in healthy women without underlying risk factors. It is important to note that oral contraceptives do not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. Women who use oral contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke. Women should discuss the benefits and risks of Ocs with their healthcare provider.",
Contraception,Estrostep (norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol),"General Information
Estrostep, a graduated Estrophasic oral contraceptive, has been approved as an oral contraceptive. Other birth control pills usually contain a constant dose of estrogen and progestin, or change the dose of progestin throughout the cycle. Estrostep is the only oral contraceptive to combine low, gradually increasing amounts of estrogen (20, 30, 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol) with a low, constant dose of progestin (one mg norethindrone acetate). When used as directed, Estrostep is greater that 99% effective in preventing pregnancy, as are all other combination OC's.
Early generation pills contained doses of estrogen as high as 150 mcg. Studies linking high doses of the hormone to adverse effects have resulted in a progressive reduction of estrogen content, leading to today's low-dose pills. The most common pill prescribed today contains a constant 35-mcg-estrogen dose.
With Estrostep, graduated amounts of estrogen are introduced into the woman's body in three phased-in doses during each menstrual cycle: 20 mcg of estrogen for the first five days, 30 mcg for the next seven days, and 35 mcg for the last nine days, for a total of 21 days. Estrogen and progestin are stopped for the remaining seven days of the cycle, resulting in a woman's monthly menstrual period. The 28-day pill pack will contain seven inactive tablets to help women maintain their regimen.
Clinical Results
While both estrogen and progestin play a role in the efficacy of combination OC's, the estrogen component also contributes to maintaining menstrual cycle control. Clinical studies of Estrostep show that its unique graduated low estrogen doses are sufficient to provide good endometrial support. Few women in these studies discontinued Estrostep due to missed periods and breakthrough bleeding. These particular complaints are frequent among women who are trying the pill for the first time.
In a comparative clinical study involving more than 1,200 women (769 receiving Estrostep), Estrostep was shown to have a high degree of patient acceptance, with a side effect profile comparable to other low-dose OC's.
","Side Effects
OC's are associated with side effects. Nausea, vomiting, and breakthrough bleeding are common side effects that may subside within the first three months of use. Clinical studies with Estrostep showed that weight gain and nausea each caused less than one percent of women to withdraw from therapy.",,

Contraception,Mircette,"General Information
Mircette has been approved as an oral contraceptive in the U.S. Mircette tablets are the first oral contraceptive to use a shortened hormone-free interval. The Mircette regime reduces the daily estrogen dose from the commonly prescribed 30-35 mcg level to the 20 mcg level, while maintaining cycle control and a favorable tolerability profile.",,,
Contraception,Mirena (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system),"General Information
Mirena is a hormone-releasing system placed in the uterus to prevent pregnancy for up to five years. Mirena works by delivering a low dose of the progestin levonorgestrel directly to the lining of the uterus. Prevention of pregnancy may be due to subsequent thickening of cervical mucus, which prevents the passage of sperm, inhibition of sperm mobility and inhibition of endometrial growth.
Mirena has been available for ten years in Europe and has been used by approximately two million women worldwide. Berlex Laboratories will market Mirena under a license from The Population Council, which initially developed the contraceptive.
Clinical Results
Two large trials of Mirena conducted in Finland and Sweden consisted of a predominately Caucasian trial population, and over 70% of the participants had previously used IUDs. Results from 1169 women 18 to 35 years of age who used Mirena for up to five years indicated that the drug produced 12-month pregnancy rates less than or equal to 0.2 per 100 women. Additionally, the cumulative 5-year pregnancy rate was approximately 0.7 per 100 women. However, due to limitations of the available data a precise estimate of the pregnancy rate is not possible. (from Mirena Physician Insert)
","Side Effects
In clinical trials, side effects of Mirena were most common during the first months after insertion and subsided during prolonged use. Side effects associated with Mirena include (but are not limited to) the following:
Acne
Back pain
Breast tenderness
Headaches
Mood changes
Nausea
Like many contraceptives, Mirena does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.
In addition to preventing pregnancy, Mirena use may result in a change in bleeding patterns. There may be an increase in intermenstrual bleeding in the first three to six months following insertion. After this, a woman's period may become shorter and lighter. Some women experience an absence of menstrual bleeding after one year.
Use of IUDs has been associated with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The highest risk of PID occurs shortly after insertion (usually within the first 20 days). Please contact a health care provider for a complete list of possible Mirena side effects or for more information.
","Additional Information
For additional information on Mirena, including Patient Information and the Physician Insert, please visit Berlex Laboratories.","Mechanism of Action
The local mechanism by which continuously released levonorgestrel enhances contraceptive effectiveness of the IUD has not been determined. Studies suggest several mechanisms that prevent pregnancy: thickening of cervical mucus, inhibition of sperm mobility and inhibition of endometrial growth. (from Mirena Physician Insert)

Coronary Artery Disease,Kengreal (cangrelor),"General Information
Kengreal (cangrelor) is a direct P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibitor that blocks ADP-induced platelet activation and aggregation. Cangrelor binds selectively and reversibly to the P2Y12 receptor to prevent further signaling and platelet activation.
Kengreal is specifically indicated as an adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention for reducing the risk of periprocedural myocardial infarction, repeat coronary revascularization, and stent thrombosis in patients in who have not been treated with a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor and are not being given a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.
Kengreal is supplied as asterile white to off-white lyophilized powder for reconstitution into an IV infusion. The recommended dosage is a 30 mcg/kg IV bolus followed immediately by a 4 mcg/kg/min IV infusion. Initiate the bolus infusion prior to PCI. The maintenance infusion should ordinarily be continued for at least 2 hours or for the duration of PCI, whichever is longer.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Kengreal was based on CHAMPION PHOENIX, a randomized, double-blind study in which subjects with coronary artery disease (stable angina, UA/NSTEMI, STEMI) requiring PCI and receiving standard therapy including aspirin and heparin or bivalirudin were randomized to Kengreal (n=5472) or to clopidogrel (n=5470). Subjects who had already taken an oral P2Y12 platelet inhibitor or who had been administered glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI), or for whom GPI use was planned, were not eligible to enroll. Kengreal was administered as 30 mcg/kg bolus followed by 4 mcg/kg/min infusion for 2 to 4 hours. Clopidogrel 600 mg was administered immediately at the end of the Kengreal infusion in subjects randomized to Kengreal. Clopidogrel 300 mg or 600 mg was administered shortly before PCI or shortly afterward, in subjects randomized to clopidogrel. The primary outcome measure was the first occurrence of any one of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemia-driven revascularization (IDR), and stent thrombosis (ST) within 48 hours after randomization. Kengreal significantly reduced the occurrence of primary composite endpoint events compared to clopidogrel (relative risk reduction [RRR] 22%). Most of the effect was a reduction in post-procedural MIs detected solely by elevations in CK-MB (type 4a MI). Kengreal did not reduce the risk of death.

Crohn's Disease,Cimzia (certolizumab pegol),"General Information
Cimzia is a humanized, pegylated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) inhibitor. TNFa is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine with a central role in inflammatory processes.
Cimzia is specifically indicated for reducing signs and symptoms of Crohnâ€™s disease and maintaining clinical response in adult patients with moderately to severely active disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.
Cimzia is supplied as a powder for reconstitution into a liquid formulation designed for subcutaneous administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 400 mg (given as two subcutaneous injections of 200 mg) initially, and at Weeks 2 and 4. In patients who obtain a clinical response, the recommended maintenance regimen is 400 mg every four weeks.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Cimzia was based on the results of two clinical trials.
Study CD1
This randomized placebo-controlled study enrolled 662 subjects with active Crohnâ€™s disease. The subjects received Cimzia (400 mg subcutaneously) or placebo administered at Weeks 0, 2, and 4 and then every four weeks to Week 24. Assessments were done at Weeks 6 and 26. Clinical response was defined as at least a 100-point reduction in CDAI score compared to baseline, and clinical remission was defined as an absolute CDAI score of 150 points or lower. At Week 6 the proportion of clinical responders was 35% in the Cimzia group compared to 27% in the placebo group (p-value < 0.05). Clinical remission was seen in 22% of the Cimzia group and 17% of the placebo group; this did not reach statistical significance. At Week 26 the proportion of clinical responders was 37% in the Cimzia arm and 27% in the placebo arm and clinical remission was seen in 29% of the Cimzia arm and 18% of the placebo arm (p-value < 0.05 for both endpoints).
Study CD2
All the subjects who entered this randomized treatment-withdrawal study were initially treated with Cimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 4. They were subsequently assessed for clinical response at Week 6 (as defined by at least a 100-point reduction in CDAI score). At Week 6, a group of 428 clinical responders were randomized to receive either Cimzia 400 mg or placebo, every four weeks starting at Week 8, as maintenance therapy through Week 24. Non-responders were withdrawn from the study. Final evaluation was based on the CDAI score at Week 26. At Week 26 the proportion of clinical responders in the Cimzia 400 mg x3 + Placebo group was 36% compared to 63% in the Cimzia 400 mg arm (p < 0.05). Clinical remission was seen in 29% of the Cimzia/placebo arm and 48% in the Cimzia arm (p < 0.05).

Certolizumab pegol is a humanized, pegylated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) inhibitor. TNFa is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine with a central role in inflammatory processes. Certolizumab pegol selectively neutralizes TNFa (IC90 of 4 ng/mL for inhibition of human TNFa in the in vitro L929 murine fibrosarcoma cytotoxicity assay) but does not neutralize lymphotoxin a (TNFÃŸ). Certolizumab pegol was shown to neutralize membrane-associated and soluble human TNFa in a dose-dependent manner.

Crohn's Disease,Entocort EC (budesonide),"General Information
Entocort EC has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of mild-to-moderate, active Crohn's disease involving certain sections of the small and large intestines (ileum and/or ascending colon). This once-daily medication targets the intestines and is then quickly metabolized, this reduces the amount of drug entering the systemic circulation, potentially reducing side effects.
According to the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, there may be up to 1,000,000 Americans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The category of IBD includes both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, two similar disorders of unknown origin. Crohn's disease typically occurs in the ileum and colon, but it can take place in any section of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms of the disorder can include diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, fever and sometimes bleeding from the rectum.
Clinical Results
Entocort EC was evaluated in five randomized, double-blind trials that included 994 subjects with mild-to-moderate, active Crohn's disease of the ileum and/or ascending colon. In these studies, clinical improvement was defined as achievement of a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of less than or equal to 150.
One of the trials was designed to compare treatment with Entocort EC 9 mg every morning to a comparator. At baseline, the median CDAI was 272. Entocort EC produced a 69% clinical improvement rate after eight weeks of treatment compared to 45% for the comparator.
Two of the trials were designed to compare Entocort EC to treatment with a placebo. In the first trial, which included 258 subjects, increasing doses of Entocort EC (1.5 mg bid, 4.5 mg bid or 7.5 mg bid) were evaluated. At baseline, the median CDAI was 290. Treatment with 9 mg per day produced statistically significant results compared to placebo, and no additional benefit was seen with an increased dose of 15 mg per day. In the second trial, the median CDAI at baseline was 263. Neither 9 mg qd or 4.5 mg bid dose levels produced statistically significant results compared to placebo.
Two additional trials were designed to compare Entocort EC with oral prednisolone. In the first trial, the clinical improvement rates were equal (60%) between the Entocort EC 9 mg qd and prednisolone groups. In the second trial, clinical response rates were 52% for Entocort EC 9 mg qd and 65% for prednisolone. In both trials, the proportion of subjects with normal plasma cortisol values was significantly higher in the Entocort EC groups than in the prednisolone groups at week eight.
","Side Effects
The most common adverse events reported by subjects in Entocort EC clinical trials include the following:
Headache
Respiratory infection
Nausea
Symptoms of hypercorticism
According to trial data, the frequency of glucocorticosteroid-associated adverse events was substantially reduced with Entocort EC capsules compared to prednisolone (at equivalent doses).
","Additional Information
For additional information on this medication, please visit the Entocort EC product web site or AstraZeneca.
Further information on Crohn's disease can be obtained through the National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases.","Mechanism of Action
Budesonide has a high glucocorticoid effect and a weak mineralocorticoid effect, and the affinity of budesonide to glucocorticosteroid receptors, which reflects the intrinsic potency of the drug, is about 200-fold that of cortisol and 15-fold that of prednisolone.
Entocort EC contains granules that are coated to prevent dissolution in gastric juice, but which dissolve at pH>5.5, i.e., normally when the granules reach the duodenum. Thereafter, a matrix of ethylcellulose with budesonide controls the release of the drug into the intestinal lumen in a time-dependent manner. (from Entocort EC Prescribing Information)

Crohn's Disease,Entyvio (vedolizumab),"General Information
Entyvio (vedolizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody.Vedolizumab targets a protein called alpha-4-beta-7, an integrin on inflammatory cells that causes these cells to adhere to the gastrointestinal tract.
Entyvio is specifically indicated for adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker or immunomodulator; or had an inadequate response with, were intolerant to, or demonstrated dependence on corticosteroid. Entyvio is indicated to induce and maintain clinical response/clinical remission, achieve corticosteroid-free remission and improve the endoscopic appearance of the mucosa (UC).
Entyvio is supplied as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution into a solution for intravenous administration. The recommended dose for UC and CD is 300 mg infused intravenously over approximately 30 minutes at zero, two and six weeks, then every eight weeks thereafter.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Ulcerative colitis
The FDA approval of Entyvio for ulcerative colitis was based on two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (UC Trials I and II) in adults with moderately to severely active UC. Enrolled patients in the US had over the previous five-year period an inadequate response or intolerance to immunomodulator therapy and/or an inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to a TNF blocker. Outside the US, prior treatment with corticosteroids was sufficient for entry if over the previous five-year period the patients were corticosteroid dependent or had an inadequate response or intolerance to corticosteroids. The primary endpoints was based on clinical response: reduction in complete Mayo score of >3 points and >30% from baseline with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of >1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of <1 point. Clinical remission: complete Mayo score of <2 points and no individual subscore >1 point. Improvement of endoscopic appearance of the mucosa: Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 (normal or inactive disease) or 1 (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability).
UC Trial 1
374 subjects were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive Entyvio 300 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion at Week 0 and Week 2. Efficacy assessments were at Week 6. Concomitant stable dosages of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunomodulators were permitted through Week 6. A greater percentage of patients treated with Entyvio compared to placebo achieved clinical response (26% placebo vs. 47% Entyvio) and achieved clinical remission (5% placebo vs. 17% Entyvio) at Week 6. In addition, a greater percentage of patients treated with Entyvio had improvement of endoscopic appearance of the mucosa at Week 6 (25% placebo vs. 41% Entyvio).
UCTrial 2
In order to be randomized to treatment in UC Trial II, patients had to have received Entyvio and be in clinical response at Week 6. Patients could have come from either UC Trial I or from a group who received Entyvio open-label. 373 patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to one of the following regimens beginning at Week 6: Entyvio 300 mg every eight weeks, Entyvio 300 mg every four weeks or placebo every four weeks. Efficacy assessments were at Week 52. Concomitant aminosalicylates and corticosteroids were permitted through Week 52. Concomitant immunomodulators were permitted outside the US but were not permitted beyond Week 6 in the US. A greater percentage of patients in groups treated with Entyvio as compared to placebo achieved clinical remission at Week 52, and maintained clinical response (clinical response at both Weeks 6 and 52). In addition, a greater percentage of patients in groups treated with Entyvio as compared to placebo were in clinical remission at both Weeks 6 and 52, and had improvement of endoscopic appearance of the mucosa at Week 52. In the subgroup of patients who achieved clinical response at Week 6 and were receiving corticosteroid medication at baseline, a greater proportion of patients in groups treated with Entyvio as compared to placebo discontinued corticosteroids and were in clinical remission at Week 52. The Entyvio every four week dosing regimen did not demonstrate additional clinical benefit over the every eight dosing week regimen.
Crohn's disease
The FDA approval of Entyvio for Crohn's disease was based on three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (CD Trials I, II, and III) in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohnâ€™s disease (CD). Enrolled patients in the US had over the previous five-year period an inadequate response or intolerance to immunomodulator therapy and/or an inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers. Outside the US, prior treatment with corticosteroids was sufficient for entry if over the previous five-year period the patients were corticosteroid dependent or had an inadequate response or intolerance to corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was Clinical Remission: CDAI <150. The primary analysis population for CD Trial II was patients that had an inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers (76% of the overall population).
CD Trial 1
368 patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive Entyvio 300 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion at Week 0 and Week 2. Efficacy assessments were at Week 6. A statistically significantly higher percentage of patients treated with Entvio achieved clinical remission as compared to placebo at Week 6 (7% placebo vs. 15% Entyvio).
CD Trial 2
Compared to CD Trial I, CD Trial II enrolled a higher number of patients who had over the previous five-year period had an inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers (76%); this was the primary analysis population. In CD Trial II, 416 patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either Entyvio 300 mg or placebo at Weeks 0, 2 and 6. Efficacy assessments were at Weeks 6 and 10. For the primary endpoint (clinical remission at Week 6), treatment with Entyvio did not result in statistically significant improvement over placebo (12% placebo and 15% Entyvio). Secondary endpoints including assessments at Week 10 were not tested because the primary endpoint was not statistically significant.
CD Trial 3
In order to be randomized to treatment in CD Trial III, patients had to have received Entyvio and be in clinical response (defined as a >70-point decrease in CDAI score from baseline) at Week 6. 461 patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to one of the following regimens beginning at Week 6: Entyvio 300 mg every eight weeks, Entyvio 300 mg every four weeks or placebo every four weeks. Efficacy assessments were at Week 52. Concomitant aminosalicylates and corticosteroids were permitted through Week 52. Concomitant immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) were permitted outside the US but were not permitted beyond Week 6 in the US. A greater percentage of patients in groups treated with Entyvio as compared to placebo were in clinical remission (defined as CDAI score <150) at Week 52 (22% placebo vs. 39% Entyvio). A greater percentage of patients in groups treated with Entyvio as compared to placebo had a clinical response (defined as >100 decrease in CDAI score from baseline) at Week 52 (30% placebo vs. 44% Entyvio). In the subgroup of patients who were receiving corticosteroids at baseline and who were in clinical response at Week 6, a greater proportion of patients in groups treated with Entyvio as compared to placebo discontinued corticosteroids by Week 52 and were in clinical remission at Week 52. The Entyvio every four week dosing regimen did not demonstrate additional clinical benefit over the every eight dosing week regimen.

Entyvio (vedolizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the a4ÃŸ7 integrin and blocks the interaction of a4ÃŸ7 integrin with mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) and inhibits the migration of memory T-lymphocytes across the endothelium into inflamed gastrointestinal parenchymal tissue. The a4ÃŸ7 integrin is expressed on the surface of a discrete subset of memory T-lymphocytes that preferentially migrate into the gastrointestinal tract. MAdCAM-1 is mainly expressed on gut endothelial cells and plays a critical role in the homing of T-lymphocytes to gut lymph tissue. The interaction of the a4ÃŸ7 integrin with MAdCAM-1 has been implicated as an important contributor to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of ulcerative colitis and Crohnâ€™s disease.

Crohn's Disease,Stelara (ustekinumab),"General Information
Stelara (ustekinumab) is a human IgG1k monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to the p40 protein subunit used by both the interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 cytokines. IL-12 and IL-23 are naturally occurring cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses, such as natural killer cell activation and CD4+ T-cell differentiation and activation.
Stelara is specifically indicated for:
Adult patients (18 years or older) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.
Active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), alone or in combination with methotrexate.
Moderately to severely active Crohnâ€™s disease in patients who have failed or were intolerant to treatment with immunomodulators or corticosteroids, but never failed a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker or failed or were intolerant to treatment with one or more TNF blockers.
Stelara is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous injection. The recommended initial dose of the drug is as follows:
Plaque psoriasis:

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Psoriasis
The FDA approval of Stelara was based on two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: STUDY 1 (n=766) and STUDY 2 (n=1,230). All subjects were 18 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis over a minimum body surface area of 10%, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score >12, and who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. In both studies, subjects were randomized to the following groups: placebo at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by crossover to Stelara (either 45 mg or 90 mg) at Weeks 12 and 16; or Stelara 45 mg or 90 mg doses, regardless of weight, at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. In both studies, the endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% reduction in PASI score (PASI 75) from baseline to Week 12 and treatment success (cleared or minimal) on the Physicianâ€™s Global Assessment (PGA). In STUDY 1, the PASI75 response was reached by 3%, 67% and 66% of the placebo and Stelara 45 mg and 90 mg doses, respectively. The PGA of Cleared or Minimal was reached by 4%, 59% and 61% of the placebo, Stelara 45 mg and 90 mg doses, respectively. Subjects in STUDY 1 were evaluated through Week 52. At Week 40, those who were PASI 75 responders at both Weeks 28 and 40 were re-randomized to either continued dosing of Stelara at Week 40 or to withdrawal of therapy (placebo at Week 40). At Week 52, 89% of subjects re-randomized to Stelara treatment were PASI 75 responders compared with 63% of subjects re-randomized to placebo (treatment withdrawal after Week 28 dose). In STUDY 2, the PASI75 response was reached by 4%, 67% and 76% of the placebo and Stelara 45 mg and 90 mg doses, respectively. The PGA of Cleared or Minimal was reached by 4%, 68% and 73% of the placebo, Stelara 45 mg and 90 mg doses, respectively. In subjects who weighed <100 kg, response rates were similar with both the 45 mg and 90 mg doses; however, in subjects who weighed >100 kg, higher response rates were seen with 90 mg dosing compared with 45 mg dosing.
Psoriatic Arthritis
Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, PsA STUDY 1 (n=615) and PsA STUDY 2 (n=312), enrolled adult patients 18 years of age and older with active PsA (>5 swollen joints and â‰¥5 tender joints) despite non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) or disease modifying antirheumatic (DMARD) therapy. Patients were randomized to receive treatment with Stelara 45 mg, 90 mg, or placebo subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by every 12 weeks (q12w) dosing. Approximately 50% of patients continued on stable doses of MTX . The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving ACR 20 response at Week 24. In both studies, a greater proportion of patients achieved ACR 20, ACR 50 and PASI 75 response in the Stelara 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared to placebo at Week 24.
Crohn's disease
Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies were cnducted in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohnâ€™s disease (Crohnâ€™s Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score of 220 to 450). There were two 8-week intravenous induction studies (UNITI-1 (n=741) and UNITI-2 (n=627)) followed by a 44-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance study, representing 52 weeks of therapy. In clinical studies of patients who were either new to, experienced with, or failed biologic therapy (TNF blockers), between 34% (UNITI-1 study) and 56% (UNITI-2 study) of patients experienced relief from their Crohn's disease symptoms in six weeks after receiving the one-time intravenous (IV) infusion of Stelara. Noticeable improvement was observed as early as three weeks. Additionally, the majority of those who responded to induction dosing and continued treatment with Stelara subcutaneous maintenance doses every 8 weeks were in remission at the end of 44 weeks (52 weeks from initiation of the induction dose).

Crohn's Disease,Tysabri (natalizumab),"General Information
Tysabri is a humanized monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of potential therapeutics known as alpha-4 integrin inhibitors. Tysabri binds to the cell surface receptors known as alpha-4-beta-1 (VLA-4) and alpha-4-beta-7. The receptors for the a4 family of integrins include vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which is expressed on activated vascular endothelium, and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) present on vascular endothelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. It is designed to block immune cell adhesion to blood vessel walls; it thus blocks subsequent migration of lymphocytes into tissue.
Tysabri is specifically indicated for inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohnâ€™s disease with evidence of inflammation who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, conventional CD therapies and inhibitors of TNF-a.
Tysabri is supplied as a 300 mg vial designed for intravenous infusion. This concentrated solution that must be diluted prior to intravenous infusion. The recommended initial dose of the drug is a 300 mg intravenous infusion over one hour every four weeks. Tysabri should not be used with concomitant immunosuppressants or concomitant inhibitors of TNF-a. If the patient with Crohnâ€™s disease has not experienced therapeutic benefit by 12 weeks of induction therapy, discontinue treatment.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Tysabri for Crohn's disease was based on the results of three clinical trials. These randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials enrolled a total of 1,414 adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohnâ€™s disease (Crohnâ€™s Disease Activity Index [CDAI] =220 and =450). Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunosuppressants were permitted. Induction of clinical response (defined as a greater than or equal to 70-point decrease in CDAI from baseline) was evaluated in two studies.
Study CD1
In this study, 896 subjects were randomized 4:1 to receive three monthly infusions of either 300 mg Tysabri or placebo. Clinical results were assessed at Week 10, and subjects with incomplete information were considered as not having a clinical response. At Week 10, 56% of the 717 subjects receiving Tysabri were responders compared to 49% of the 179 subjects receiving placebo (treatment effect: 7%; 95% confidence interval (CI): [-1%, 16%]; p=0.067. In a post hoc analysis of a subset of 653 subjects with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), indicative of active inflammation, 57% of Tysabri patients were in response compared to 45% of those receiving placebo (treatment effect: 12%; 95% CI: [3%, 22%]; nominal p=0.01).
Study CD2
This trial enrolled 509 subjects with elevated serum C-reactive Protein (CRP). Clinical response and clinical remission (defined as CDAI score <150) were required to be met at both Weeks 8 and 12, rather than at a single time-point; patients with incomplete information were considered as not having a response. The study also assessed the proportion of patients who did not lose clinical remission at any study visit within the subset of those who were in remission at study entry. At weeks 8 and 12 the clinical response in the Tysabri arm was 56% and 60% versus 40% and 44% in the placebo arm, respectively. At weeks 8 and 12 the clinical remission in the Tysabri arm was 32% and 37% versus 21% and 25%in the placebo arm, respectively. For patients in Study CD2 with an inadequate response to prior treatment with inhibitors of TNF-a, clinical response at both Weeks 8 and 12 was seen in 38% of those randomized to Tysabri, and clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 12 was seen in 17%.
Study CD3
This trial was designed to evaluate Tysabri maintenance therapy. Three hundred and thirty one subjects from Study CD1 that had had a clinical response to Tysabri at both Weeks 10 and 12 were re-randomized 1:1 to treatment with continuing monthly infusions of either 300 mg Tysabri or placebo. Maintenance of response was assessed by the proportion of patients who did not lose clinical response at any study visit for an additional 6 and 12 months of treatment. The study also assessed the proportion of patients who did not lose clinical remission at any study visit within the subset of those who were in remission at study entry. Clinical response through month 9 and month 15 in the Tysabri arm was 61% and 54% versus 29% and 20% for the placebo arm, respectively. Clinical remission through month 9 and month 15 was 45% and 40% for the Tysabri arm versus 26% and 15% for the placebo arm, respectively. For patients in study CD3 with an inadequate response to prior treatment with inhibitors of TNF-a, maintenance of clinical response through month 9 was seen in 52% of those randomized to Tysabri, and maintenance of clinical remission through month 9 was seen in 30%.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Tysabri may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Headache
Upper respiratory tract infection
Nausea
Influenza
Back pain
Fatigue
Arthralgia
Rash
Pharyngolaryngeal pain
In addition, Tysabri increases the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic viral infection of the brain that usually leads to death or severe disability. Patients who have significantly compromised immune system function should not ordinarily be treated with Tysabri. Because of the risk of PML, Tysabri is available only through a special restricted distribution program called the TOUCH Prescribing Program. Under this program only prescribers, infusion centers, and pharmacies associated with infusion centers registered with the program are able to prescribe, distribute, or infuse the product.

MAdCAM-1 expression has been found to be increased at active sites of inflammation in patients with CD, which suggests it may play a role in the recruitment of leukocytes to the mucosa and contribute to the inflammatory response characteristic of CD.

Cushing's Disease,Korlym (mifepristone),"General Information
Korlym (mifepristone) is a small-molecule progesterone and glucocorticoid antagonist. It blocks the binding of cortisol to its receptor. It does not decrease cortisol production but reduces the effects of excess cortisol, such as high blood sugar levels.
Korlym was specifically approved to control hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adults with endogenous Cushing's syndrome who have type II diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery.
Korlym is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is a single dose of 300 mg orally once daily. The daily dose of Korlym may be increased in 300 mg increments. The dose of Korlym may be increased to a maximum of 1200 mg once daily but should not exceed 20 mg/kg per day. Increases in dose should not occur more frequently than once every 2-4 weeks.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Korlym was based on an uncontrolled, open-label, 24-week, multicenter clinical study. The study enrolled 50 subjects with clinical and biochemical evidence of hypercortisolemia despite prior surgical treatment and radiotherapy. The subjects were placed in one of two cohorts: a diabetes cohort and a hypertension cohort and were evaluated separately. Korlym treatment was started at a dose of 300 mg once a day. The study protocol allowed an increase in dose to 600 mg after two weeks, and then by additional 300 mg increments every four weeks to a maximum of 900 mg per day for patients <60 kg, or 1200 mg per day for patients >60 kg.
Diabetes Cohort
The primary efficacy analysis for the diabetes cohort was an analysis of responders. A responder was defined as a subject who had a â‰¥25% reduction from baseline in glucose AUC. Fifteen of 25 subjects (60%) were treatment responders.
Hypertension Cohort
There were no changes in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures at the end of the trial relative to baseline.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Korlym may include, but are not limited to, the following:
nausea
fatigue
headache
decreased blood potassium
arthralgia
vomiting
peripheral edema
hypertension
dizziness
decreased appetite
endometrial hypertrophy
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Korlym or hyperglycemia in adults with endogenous Cushingâ€™s syndrome, please visit the Corcept web page.","Mechanism of Action
Korlym (mifepristone) is a small-molecule progesterone and glucocorticoid antagonist. It is a selective antagonist of the progesterone receptor at low doses and blocks the glucocorticoid receptor (GR-II) at higher doses. Mifepristone has high affinity for the GR-II receptor but little affinity for the GR-I (MR, mineralocorticoid) receptor. In addition, mifepristone appears to have little or no affinity for estrogen, muscarinic, histaminic, or monoamine receptors.

Cushing's Disease,Signifor (pasireotide diaspartate),"General Information
Signifor (pasireotide diaspartate) is a somatostatin analog. Pasireotide exerts its pharmacological activity via binding to somatostatin receptor subtypes (ssts) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. These receptor subtypes are expressed in different tissues under normal physiological conditions. Corticotroph tumor cells from Cushingâ€™s disease patients frequently over-express ssts5 whereas the other receptor subtypes are often not expressed or are expressed at lower levels. Pasireotide binds and activates the hsst receptors resulting in inhibition of Adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion, which leads to decreased cortisol secretion.
Signifor is specifically indicated for the treatment of adults with Cushingâ€™s disease for whom pituitary surgery is not an option or has not been curative.
Signifor is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous injection. The recommended initial dose is either 0.6 mg or 0.9 mg by subcutaneous injection twice a day. The recommended dosage range is 0.3 to 0.9 mg. Patients should be evaluated for a treatment response [clinically meaningful reduction in 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels and/or improvement in signs or symptoms of the disease] and should continue receiving therapy with Signifor as long as benefit is derived. See prescription label for any dose modifications.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Signifor was based on a phase III, multicenter, randomized study. The trial enrolled 162 subjects with Cushingâ€™s disease with persistent or recurrent disease despite pituitary surgery or de novo patients for whom surgery was not indicated or who had refused surgery. Subjects with a baseline 24-hour urine free cortisol (UFC) >1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) were randomized to receive a Signifor dosage of either 0.6 mg subcutaneous b.i.d. or 0.9 mg subcutaneous b.i.d.. After three months of treatment, patients with a mean 24-hour UFC = 2.0 x ULN and below or equal to their baseline values continued blinded treatment at the randomized dose until Month 6. Patients who did not meet these criteria were unblinded and the dose was increased by 0.3 mg b.i.d. After the initial six months in the study, patients entered an additional 6-month open-label treatment period. The dosage could be reduced by 0.3 mg b.i.d. at any time during the study for intolerability. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved normalization of mean 24hour UFC levels after six months of treatment and did not dose increase during this period. At Month 6, the percentages of responders for the primary endpoint were 15% and 26% in the 0.6 mg b.i.d. and 0.9 mg b.i.d. groups, respectively. Signifor resulted in a decrease in the mean 24-hour UFC after 1 month of treatment. For subjects (n=78) who stayed in the trial, similar UFC lowering was observed at Month 12.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Signifor may include, but are not limited to, the following:
diarrhea
nausea

Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma,Istodax (romidepsin),"General Information
Istodax (romidepsin) is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from acetylated lysine residues in histones, resulting in the modulation of gene expression. HDACs also deacetylate non-histone proteins, such as transcription factors.
Istodax is specifically indicated for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in patients who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.
Istodax is supplied as solution for intravenous administration. The recommended dose of romidepsin is 14 mg/m2 administered intravenously over a 4-hour period on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Cycles should be repeated every 28 days provided that the patient continues to benefit from and tolerates the therapy.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Istodax was was based upon two prospective multicenter, single-arm clinical studies in 167 subjects. The primary efficacy endpoint for both studies was overall objective disease response rate (ORR) based on the investigator assessments and defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).
Study One
This study enrolled 96 patients with confirmed CTCL after failure of at least 1 prior systemic therapy. The subjects were treated with Istodax at a starting dose of 14 mg/m2 infused over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. The overall response rate (ORR) was 34% and the complete response rate was 6%. The median response duration was 15 months and the median time to first response was 2 months.

Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma,Valchlor (mechlorethamine) gel,"General Information
Valchlor is a gel formulation of mechlorethamine, an alkylating agent which inhibits rapidly proliferating cells.
Valchlor is specifically indicated for the topical treatment of Stage IA and IB mycosisfungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients who have received prior skin-directed therapy.
Valchlor is supplied as a gel for topical administration. The recommendation is to apply a thin film of Valchlor gel once daily to affected areas of the skin. Upon improvement, treatment with Valchlor can be restarted at a reduced frequency of once every 3 days. If reintroduction of treatment is tolerated for at least one week, the frequency of application can be increased to every other day for at least one week and then to once daily application if tolerated.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Valchlor gel was based on a randomized, multicenter, observer-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority clinical trial of 260 subjects with Stage IA, IB, and IIA mycosisfungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) who had received at least one prior skin-directed therapy. The subjects were stratified based on Stage (IA vs. IB and IIA) and then randomized to receive Valchlor 0.016% (equivalent to 0.02% mechlorethamineHCl) or Aquaphor-based mechlorethamine HCl 0.02% ointment (Comparator). Eighteen subjects were excluded from the efficacy analysis due to protocol violations involving randomization at a single site. Study drug was applied topically on a daily basis for 12 months. Concomitant use of topical corticosteroids was not permitted during the study. The mean daily usage of Valchlor gel was 2.8 g. The maximum daily usage was 10.5 g. Subjects were evaluated for a response on amonthly basis for the first 6 months and then every 2 months for the last 6 months using the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) score. A response was defined as greater than or equal to 50% reduction in baseline CAILS score which was confirmed at the next visit at least 4 weeks later. A complete response was defined as a confirmed CAILS score of 0 (no symptoms). Subjects were also evaluated using the Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (SWAT). A response was defined as greater than or equal to 50% reduction in baseline SWAT score which was confirmed at the next visit at least 4 weeks later. Sixty percent (60%) of the subjects on the Valchlor arm and 48% of subjects on the comparator arm achieved a response based on the CAILS score. Valchlor was non-inferiorto the comparator based on a CAILS overall response rate ratio of 1.24.

Cystic Fibrosis,Cayston (aztreonam for inhalation solution),"General Information
Cayston contains the active ingredient aztreonam, a monobactam antibacterial. Aztreonam exhibits activity in vitro against Gram-negative aerobic pathogens including P. aeruginosa. Aztreonam binds to penicillin binding proteins of susceptible bacteria, which leads to inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis and death of the cell.
Cayston is specifically indicated to improve respiratory symptoms in cystic fibrosis patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Cayston is supplied as a single-use vial of sterile, lyophilized aztreonam to be reconstituted with a 1 mL ampule of sterile diluent designed for administration via inhalation using an Altera Nebulizer System.. The recommended dose of Cayston for both adults and pediatrics 7 years of age and older is one single-use vial (75 mg of aztreonam) reconstituted with 1 mL of sterile diluent administered 3 times a day for a 28-day course (followed by 28 days off Cayston therapy). Dosage is not based on weight or adjusted for age. Doses should be taken at least 4 hours apart.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Cayston was based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in 164 subjects. The subjects received either Cayston (75 mg) or volume-matched placebo administered by inhalation 3 times a day for 28 days. Patients were required to have been off antibiotics for at least 28 days before treatment with study drug. The primary efficacy endpoint was improvement in respiratory symptoms on the last day of treatment with Cayston or placebo. Statistically significant improvements were seen in both adult and pediatric patients, but were substantially smaller in adult patients. The treatment difference at Day 28 between Cayston-treated and placebo-treated patients for percent change in FEV1 (L) was statistically significant at 10%. Improvements in FEV1 were comparable between adult and pediatric patients. Two weeks after completion of drug treatment, the difference in FEV1 between Cayston and placebo groups had decreased to 6%.

Cystic Fibrosis,Kalydeco (ivacaftor),"General Information
Kalydeco (ivacaftor) is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in a gene that encodes for the CFTR protein that regulates ion (such as chloride) and water transport in the body. The defect in chloride and water transport results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract and other parts of the body leading to severe respiratory and digestive problems.
Kalydeco was specifically approved for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients age 6 years and older who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene. If the patientâ€™s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to detect the presence of the G551D mutation. Kalydeco was subsequently approved use in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) ages six months to less than 12 months who have at least one mutation in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that is responsive to Kalydeco based on clinical and/or in vitro assay data.
Kalydeco is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose of Kalydeco for both adults and pediatric patients age 6 years and older is one 150 mg tablet taken orally every 12 hours (300 mg total daily dose). Kalydeco is supplied as 25 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg granules for pediatric patients ages 6 months to less than 6 years.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Kalydeco was based on the following trials:
Dose Ranging:
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial enrolled 39 adult subjects. Twenty subjects with median predicted FEV1 at baseline of 56% received Kalydeco 25, 75, 150 mg or placebo every 12 hours for 14 days and 19 subjects with median predicted FEV1 at baseline of 69% received Kalydeco 150, 250 mg or placebo every 12 hours for 28 days. The optimal dose was determined to be 150 mg every 12 hours.
Efficacy
Two randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trials enrolled 213 clinically stable subjects who received Kalydeco 150 mg twice daily or placebo every 12 hours with food containing fat for 48 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies. Trial 1 enrolled 161 subjects who were 12 years of age or older with baseline FEV1 between 40-90% predicted. Trial 2 evaluated 52 subjects who were 6 to 11 years of age with baseline FEV1 between 40-105% predicted. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was improvement in lung function as determined by the mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted pre-dose FEV1 through 24 weeks of treatment. In both studies, treatment with Kalydeco resulted in a significant improvement in FEV1. The treatment difference between Kalydeco and placebo for the mean absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline through Week 24 was 10.6 percentage points (P < 0.0001) in Trial 1 and 12.5 percentage points (P < 0.0001) in Trial 2. These changes persisted through 48 weeks.
The FDA approval of Kalydeco for use in patients 6 months to less than 12 months was based on data from a 24-week Phase 3 open-label safety cohort (ARRIVAL) of 11 children with CF aged six months to less than 12 months who have one of 10 mutations in the CFTR gene (G551D, G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, G1349D or R117H). The study demonstrated a safety profile similar to that observed in previous Phase 3 studies of older children and adults; most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, and no patient discontinued therapy due to adverse events. Mean baseline sweat chloride for the children in this cohort was 101.5 mmol/L (n=11). Following 24 weeks of treatment with Kalydeco, the mean sweat chloride level was 43.1 mmol/L (n=6). In the six subjects with paired sweat chloride samples at baseline and week 24, there was a mean absolute change of -58.6 mmol/L.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Kalydeco may include, but are not limited to, the following:

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Kalydeco or cystic fibrosis, please visit the Kalydeco web page.","Mechanism of Action
Kalydeco (ivacaftor) is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator. The CFTR protein is a chloride channel present at the surface of epithelial cells in multiple organs. Ivacaftor facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the channel-open probability (or gating) of the G551D-CFTR protein. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in a gene that encodes for the CFTR protein that regulates ion (such as chloride) and water transport in the body. The defect in chloride and water transport results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract and other parts of the body leading to severe respiratory and digestive problems.

Cystic Fibrosis,Orkambi (lumacaftor and ivacaftor),"General Information
Orkambi is a combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, both of which are oral cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. Lumacaftor is a CFTR corrector and aims to increase CFTR function by increasing the trafficking, or movement, of CFTR to the cell surface. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator and aims to increase the function of defective CFTR proteins by increasing the gating activity, or ability to transport ions across the cell membrane, of CFTR at the cell surface.
Orkambi is specifically indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients age 2 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. If the patientâ€™s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to detect the presence of the F508del mutation on both alleles of the CFTR gene.
Orkambi is supplied as a tablet (lumacaftor 200 mg and ivacaftor 125 mg) for oral administration. The recommended dose is as follows:
â€¢ Pediatric patients age 2 through 5 years and weighing less than 14 kg: one packet of granules (each containing lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg) mixed with 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of soft food or liquid and administered orally every 12 hours with fat-containing food.
â€¢ Pediatric patients age 2 through 5 years and weighing 14 kg or greater: one packet of granules (each containing lumacaftor 150 mg/ivacaftor 188 mg) mixed with 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of soft food or liquid and administered orally every 12 hours with fat-containing food.
â€¢ Pediatric patients age 6 through 11 years: two tablets (each containing lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg) taken orally every 12 hours with fat-containing food.
â€¢ Adults and pediatric patients age 12 years and older: two tablets taken orally every 12 hours. Reduce the dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. When initiating Orkambi in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, the reduce Orkambi dose for the first week of treatment.
For specific dose reductions please see the drug label.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Orkambi was based on a dose ranging trial and two confirmatory trials.
Dose Ranging:
One double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-cohort trial enrolled 97 Caucasian patients with CF (homozygous for the F508del mutation) 18 years of age and older with a screening ppFEV1 â‰¥40. In the trial, 76 patients (homozygous for the F508del mutation) were randomized to receive lumacaftor alone at once-daily doses of 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg or 400 mg q12h for 28 days followed by the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and 27 patients (homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del mutation) received placebo. During the initial 28-day lumacaftor monotherapy period, treatment with lumacaftor demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in ppFEV1 compared to placebo. Changes from Day 1 at Day 28 in ppFEV1 compared to placebo were 0.24, -1.4, -2.7, and -4.6 for the 200 mg once daily, 400 mg once daily, 600 mg once daily, and 400 mg q12h lumacaftor doses, respectively. Following the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h, the changes from Day 1 at Day 56 in ppFEV1 compared to placebo were 3.8, 2.7, 5.6, and 4.2, respectively. Sweat chloride was also assessed in this trial. Following the initial 28 days of lumacaftor monotherapy, the changes from Day 1 at Day 28 in sweat chloride compared to placebo were -4.9, -8.3, -6.1, and -8.2 mmol/L for the 200 mg once daily, 400 mg once daily, 600 mg once daily, and 400 mg q12h lumacaftor doses, respectively. Following the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h, the changes from Day 1 at Day 56 in sweat chloride compared to placebo were -5.0, -9.8, -9.5, and -11 mmol/L, respectively. These data supported the evaluation of lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h (Orkambi formulation) and lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h in the confirmatory trials.
Confirmatory Trials:
The efficacy of Orkambi in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week clinical trials (Trials 1 and 2) in 1,108 clinically stable patients with CF of whom 369 patients received Orkambi twice daily. Trial 1 evaluated 549 patients with CF who were aged 12 years and older with ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90. Trial 2 evaluated 559 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 25.0 years) with ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90. Patients in both trials were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either Orkambi (lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h; or lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h) or placebo. Patients took the study drug with fat-containing food for 24 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies. The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was change in lung function as determined by absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at Week 24, assessed as the average of the treatment effects at Week 16 and at Week 24. In both trials, treatment with Orkambi resulted in a statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1. The treatment difference between Orkambi and placebo for the mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at Week 24 (assessed as the average of the treatment effects at Week 16 and at Week 24) was 2.6 percentage points in Trial 1 (P=0.0003) and 3.0 percentage points in Trial 2 (P<0.0001). These changes persisted throughout the 24-week treatment period. Improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, disease severity, sex, and geographic region.
The FDA approval of Orkambi in children ages 2 through 5 years was based on a Phase III open-label safety study in 60 patients that showed treatment with Orkambi was generally safe and well tolerated for 24 weeks, with a safety profile similar to that in patients ages 6 years and older. Improvements in sweat chloride were observed at week 24 (mean decrease in sweat chloride from baseline of 31.7 mmol/L; n=49).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Orkambi may include, but are not limited to, the following:
dyspnea
nasopharyngitis
nausea
diarrhea
upper respiratory tract infection
fatigue
respiration abnormal
blood creatine phosphokinase increased

Orkambi is a combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, both of which are oral cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. The CFTR protein is a chloride channel present at the surface of epithelial cells in multiple organs. The F508del mutation results in protein misfolding, causing a defect in cellular processing and trafficking that targets the protein for degradation and therefore reduces the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. The small amount of F508del-CFTR that reaches the cell surface is less stable and has low channel-open probability (defective gating activity) compared to wild-type CFTR protein. Lumacaftor improves the conformational stability of F508del-CFTR, resulting in increased processing and trafficking of mature protein to the cell surface. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the channel-open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. In vitro studies have demonstrated that both lumacaftor and ivacaftor act directly on the CFTR protein in primary human bronchial epithelial cultures and other cell lines harboring the F508del-CFTR mutation to increase the quantity, stability, and function of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increased chloride ion transport. In vitro responses do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic response or clinical benefit.

Cystic Fibrosis,Pulmozyme (dornase alfa),"General Information
A change in labeling has been approved for Pulmozyme Inhalation Solution, an aerosol treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF). Children under five may now be administered Pulmozyme. Pulmozyme had been previously approved by the FDA for use in CF patients five years or older.
","Side Effects
Adverse events in the under five patient population included voice alteration, pharyngitis, laryngitis, rash, chest pain, and conjunctivitis. Cough, including moderate to severe cough, rhinitis, and rash were reported more frequently in these very young CF patients compared to older children.",,
Cystic Fibrosis,Pulmozyme (dornase alfa),"General Information
Pulmozyme Inhalation Solution has been approved for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients with advanced disease. Pulmozyme originally received marketing clearance by the FDA in December 1993 for the management of mild to moderate cystic fibrosis in conjunction with standard therapies to reduce the incidence of respiratory tract infections requiring parenteral antibiotics and to improve pulmonary function.
Since cystic fibrosis is a disease that worsens over time, this indication supports continued use of Pulmozyme in patients with an FVC of less than 40%.
Clinical Results
The benefit of treatment with Pulmozyme in advanced Cystic Fibrosis was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled study of 320 subjects that examined safety and efficacy of Pulmozyme during a 12-week period. Advanced disease is defined by a standard measure of forced vital capacity of less than 40% of predicted (FVC less than 40%). In this study of subjects with advanced disease, measures of pulmonary function--the forced expiratory volume in one second and FVC--were significantly improved as compared to placebo. In contrast to the mild to moderate cystic fibrosis patient population, no benefit reducing the incidence of respiratory tract infections was seen.
","Side Effects
Pulmozyme was safe and generally well tolerated in the advanced cystic fibrosis population. Side effects were similar to those seen in patients with mild to moderate disease, including voice alteration, pharyngitis, laryngitis, rash, chest pain, and conjunctivitis. However, rhinitis, fever, a decrease in FVC, dyspepsia, and serious dyspnea were reported more frequently than in the placebo group.
Literature References
The results of the clinical study were published in the October issue of CHEST.
","Additional Information
Cystic Fibrosis is an inherited disorder that affects about 25,000 Americans, 3,000 Canadians, and 20,000 Europeans. A faulty gene in cystic fibrosis patients leads to the production of thick viscous secretions that can cause persistent bacterial infection and congestion. As white blood cells attempt to destroy bacteria, they release DNA, which further thickens the secretions. These thiTk secretions also encourage and prolong respiratory tract infections that damage lung tissue and ultimately lead to death. Today the average life span for patients with cystic fibrosis is 30 years compared to 14 years in 1969.",
Cystic Fibrosis,Symdeko (tezacaftor/ivacaftor),"General Information
Symdeko is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor. Tezacaftor is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) corrector. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator.
Symdeko is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who have at least one mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor based on in vitro data and/or clinical evidence. The FDA subsequently approved Symdeko tablets (June 2019) for treatment of pediatric patients ages 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis who have certain genetic mutations.
Symdeko is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is one tablet (tezacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg) taken in the morning and one tablet (ivacaftor 150 mg) taken in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart. The tablets should be swallowed whole. Symdeko should be taken with fat-containing food. See drug label for dose adjustments in patients with hepatic impairment and for co-administration with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Symdeko for patients with CF aged 12 years and older was based on three Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Trials 1, 2, and 3).
Trial 1: this was a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm study in CF patients (n=504) who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in lung function as determined by absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24. Treatment with Symdeko resulted in a statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1. The treatment difference between Symdeko and placebo for the mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 was 4.0 percentage points (P<0.0001). These changes persisted throughout the 24-week treatment period.
Trial 2: this was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, 3-treatment, 8-week crossover study in CF patients (n=244) who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second mutation predicted to be responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Mutations predicted to be responsive were selected for the study based on the clinical phenotype (pancreatic sufficiency), biomarker data (sweat chloride), and in vitro responsiveness to tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Patients were randomized to and received sequences of treatment that included Symdeko, ivacaftor, and placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean absolute change from study baseline in percent predicted FEV1 averaged at Weeks 4 and 8 of treatment. For the overall population, treatment with Symdeko compared to placebo resulted in significant improvement in ppFEV1 (6.8 percentage points; P<0.0001) Treatment difference for ppFEV1 between ivacaftor- and placebo-treated patients was 4.7 percentage points (P<0.0001) and 2.1 percentage points (P<0.0001) between Symdeko- and ivacaftor-treated patients, which were statistically significant.
Trial 3: this was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm study in CF patients who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a second CFTR mutation predicted to be unresponsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Mutations predicted to be non-responsive were selected for the study based on biologic plausibility (mutation class), clinical phenotype (pancreatic insufficiency), biomarker data (sweat chloride), and in vitro testing to tezacaftor and/or ivacaftor. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in absolute ppFEV1 through Week 12. The overall treatment difference between Symdeko and placebo for the mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 12 was 1.2 percentage points (95% CI: -0.3, 2.6). This study was terminated following the planned interim analysis because the pre-specified futility criteria were met.
The FDA approval of Symdeko tablets for treatment of pediatric patients ages 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis with certain genetic mutations. was based on a 24-week Phase 3 open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor in children ages 6 through 11 years in the U.S. and Canada. The regimen was generally well tolerated, and safety data were similar to what was observed in previous studies of patients aged 12 years and older.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Symdeko may include, but are not limited to, the following:
headache
nausea
sinus congestion
dizziness
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Symdeko or cystic fibrosis, please visit https://www.symdeko.com","Mechanism of Action
Symdeko is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor. Tezacaftor facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of normal and select mutant forms of CFTR (including F508del-CFTR) to increase the amount of mature CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the channel-open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. For ivacaftor to function CFTR protein must be present at the cell surface. Ivacaftor can potentiate the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by tezacaftor, leading to a further enhancement of chloride transport than either agent alone. The combined effect of tezacaftor and ivacaftor is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increases in chloride transport.

Cystic Fibrosis,Tobi,"General Information
Tobi (tobramycin) has been approved as an inhaled antibiotic for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. It is indicated to treat Pseudomonas aeruginose infections, a common cause of lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. The drug has been available intravenously since 1975.
Clinical Results
Clinical trials demonstrated an increase in patients' lung function to be as much as 11% during six months of treatment. Of the approximate 500 patients studied, hospital admission were reduced by 26% and stays averaged 5.1 days for Tobi patients compared with 8.1 for placebo patients.
","Side Effects
The main side effects were hoarseness and tinnitus. Eight Tobi patients had 16 episodes of tinnitus, while there were none in the placebo group. There was no evidence of hearing loss, but the FDA cautioned that tinnitus could be a preliminary indication of drug-related ototoxicity.",,
Cystic Fibrosis,"Trikafta (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor tablets; ivacaftor)","General Information
Trikafta is a combination of ivacaftor - a CFTR potentiator and tezacaftor and elexacaftor- both of which bind to different sites on the CFTR protein.
Trikafta is specifically indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.
Trikafta is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is two tablets (each containing elexacaftor 100 mg, tezacaftor 50 mg and ivacaftor 75 mg) taken in the morning and one ivacaftor tablet (containing ivacaftor 150 mg) taken in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart. Trikafta tablets should be swallowed whole. Trikafta should be taken with fat-containing food. Examples of meals or snacks that contain fat are those prepared with butter or oils or those containing eggs, cheeses, nuts, whole milk, or meats.
If 6 hours or less have passed since the missed morning or evening dose, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible and continue on the original schedule.
If more than 6 hours have passed since: 1) the missed morning dose, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible and should not take the evening dose. The next scheduled morning dose should be taken at the usual time. 2) the missed evening dose, the patient should not take the missed dose. The next scheduled morning dose should be taken at the usual time. Morning and evening doses should not be taken at the same time.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Trikafta was based on two trials. The first trial was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 403 patients who had an F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele that results in either no CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that is not responsive to ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor alone. The second trial was a four-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial in 107 patients who had two identical F508del mutations. In each trial, the primary analysis looked at increases in the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second, known as ppFEV1, which is an established marker of cystic fibrosis lung disease progression. Trikafta increased the ppFEV1 in both trials. In the first trial, it increased mean ppFEV1 13.8% from baseline compared to placebo. In the second trial, it increased mean ppFEV1 10% from baseline compared to tezacaftor/ivacaftor. In the first trial, treatment with Trikafta also resulted in improvements in sweat chloride, number of pulmonary exacerbations (worsening respiratory symptoms and lung function), and body mass index (weight-to-height ratio) compared to placebo.

Cystic Fibrosis,Ultresa (pancrelipase) delayed-release capsules,"General Information
Ultresa (pancrelipase) delayed-release capsules is a pancreatic enzyme preparation consisting of pancrelipase, an extract derived from porcine pancreatic glands. Pancrelipase contains multiple enzyme classes, including porcine-derived lipases, amylases, and proteases. The pancreatic enzymes in Ultresa act like digestive enzymes physiologically secreted by the pancreas.
Ultresa is specifically indicated for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis or other conditions.
Ultresa is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The initial dose of Ultresa should begin at the lowest recommended dose and gradually increased. The dosage of Ultresa should be individualized based on clinical symptoms, the degree of steatorrhea present, and the fat content of the diet.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ultresa was based on two clinical trials conducted in 40 subjects, ages 7 to 37 years, with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency associated with cystic fibrosis.
Study One
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study enrolled 31 subjects ages 8 to 37 years. The subjects were randomized to receive Ultresa at a dose not to exceed 2,500 lipase units per kilogram per meal or snack or matching placebo for 6 to 7 days of treatment followed by crossover to the alternate treatment for an additional 6 to 7 days. All subjects consumed a high-fat diet (2 grams of fat per kilogram of body weight per day) during the treatment periods. The final analysis population was limited to 24 subjects who completed both treatment periods and had stool results available for each treatment period.The primary endpoints were the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) and the coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA), both determined by a 72-hour stool collection during both treatments. The Mean CFA was 89% with Ultresa treatment compared to 56% with placebo treatment. The mean difference in CFA was 35 percentage points in favor of Ultresa (p<0.0001). The mean CNA was 84% with Ultresa treatment compared to 59% with placebo treatment. The mean difference in CNA was 26 percentage points in favor of Ultresa treatment (p<0.0001).
Study Two
This open-label study enrolled 9 subjects, ages 7 years to 11 years. After a 15 day screening period on individually-titrated doses of Ultresa not exceeding 2,500 lipase units per kilogram per meal, the subjects entered a 7-day washout phase before returning to a 12-day treatment phase on the same individually-titrated dose of Ultresa. The mean daily dose of Ultresa during the treatment phase was 6,846 lipase units per kilogram body weight per day. All subjects consumed a high-fat diet (2 grams of fat per kilogram of body weight per day) during both the washout phase and the treatment phase. The final analysis was limited to 7 subjects who completed both the washout and treatment phases of the study. The mean CFA was 35% during the washout phase and was 83% during the Ultresa treatment phase.

The pancreatic enzymes in Zenpep catalyze the hydrolysis of fats to monoglycerol, glycerol and fatty acids, protein into peptides and amino acids, and starch into dextrins and short chain sugars in the duodenum and proximal small intestine, thereby acting like digestive enzymes physiologically secreted by the pancreas.
Zenpep is specifically indicated for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis or other conditions.
Zenpep is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is as follows:
Infants (up to 12 months)
2,000 to 4,000 lipase units per 120 mL of formula or per breast-feeding. Do not mix Zenpep capsule contents directly into formula or breast milk prior to administration.
Children Older than 12 Months and Younger than 4 Years
1,000 lipase units/kg of body weight per meal for children less than age 4 years to a maximum of 2,500 lipase units/kg of body weight per meal (or less than or equal to 10,000 lipase units/kg of body weight per day), or less than 4,000 lipase units/g fat ingested per day.
Children 4 Years and Older and Adults
dosing should begin with 500 lipase units/kg of body weight per meal for those older than age 4 years to a maximum of 2,500 lipase units/kg of body weight per meal (or less than or equal to 10,000 lipase units/kg of body weight per day), or less than 4,000 lipase units/g fat ingested per day. Zenpep should be taken during meals or snacks, with sufficient fluid. Zenpep capsules and capsule contents should not be crushed or chewed.
Limitations on Dosing
Doses greater than 2,500 lipase units/kg of body weight per meal (or greater than 10,000 lipase units/kg of body weight per day) should be used with caution and only if they are documented to be effective by 3-day fecal fat measures that indicate a significantly improved coefficient of fat absorption.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Zenpep was based on the results of two clinical studies in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) associated with cystic fibrosis (CF).
Study One
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study enrolled 34 patients, ages 7 to 23 years. Results are from 32 subjects who completed both double-blind treatment periods, and were included in the efficacy analysis population. The subjects were randomized to receive Zenpep or matching placebo for 6 to 7 days of treatment, followed by crossover to the alternate treatment for an additional 6 to 7 days. The mean dose during the controlled treatment periods ranged from a mean dose of 3,900 lipase units per kilogram per day to 5,700 lipase units per kilogram per day. All patients consumed a high-fat diet (greater than or equal to 100 grams of fat per day) during the treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean difference in the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) between Zenpep and placebo treatment. Mean CFA was 88% with Zenpep treatment compared to 63% with placebo treatment. The mean difference in CFA was 26 percentage points in favor of Zenpep treatment (p<0.001). Subgroup analyses of the CFA results showed that mean change in CFA was greater in patients with lower no-treatment (placebo) CFA values than in patients with higher no-treatment (placebo) CFA values.
Study Two
All subjects in this study were transitioned to Zenpep from their usual PEP treatment. After a 4-14 days screening period on the current PEP, subjects received Zenpep at individually titrated doses ranging between 2,300 and 10,000 lipase units per kg body weight per day, with a mean of approximately 5000 lipase units per kg body weight per day (not to exceed 2,500 lipase units per kilogram per meal) for 14 days. There was no wash-out period. Overall, patients showed similar control of fat malabsorption by spot fecal fat testing when switched to Zenpep treatment at similar doses.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis,Oral Cytovene,"General Information
Oral Cytovene has been approved for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV), a potentially life-threatening infection, in recipients of solid organ transplants.
Clinical Results
The FDA approval is based on data, which demonstrate that oral Cytovene given as prophylaxis reduced the overall incidence of CMV disease in liver transplant recipients by 78%.
Oral Cytovene received marketing clearance based on the results of GAN 040, a multinational, randomized, double-blind study compromising 304 orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) recipients randomized (1:1) to receive oral ganciclovir (1000 mg three times daily) or matching placebo, for up to 14 weeks following transplantation.
The six-month incidence of CMV disease was 18.9% in the placebo group compared to 4.8% in the oral Cytovene group. Of the oral Cytovene patients who developed CMV disease, only one (0.7%) developed invasive tissue disease, the most severe type of CMV disease, versus 8.4% percent of placebo patients.
Oral Cytovene helped prevent CMV disease even in those recipients at highest risk for CMV disease--those who were sero-negative for CMV at the time of their transplant and received a CMV sero-positive organ. The six-month incidence of CMV disease in this group was 44% in placebo patients versus 14.8% in oral ganciclovir patients.
Patients who received the most intense immunosuppression also benefited from prophylaxis with oral Cytovene. Of those patients receiving anti-lymphocyte antibodies either for prevention of graft rejection or for treatment of refractory rejection, the incidence of CMV disease was 33% in the placebo group versus 4.6% in the ganciclovir group.
The six-month incidence of herpes simplex was reduced from 23.5% in the placebo arm to 3.5% in those receiving oral ganciclovir prophylaxis.
","Side Effects
The most common adverse events in this study were infection, fever, and headache. These events occurred with similar frequency in the ganciclovir-treated and placebo groups.
","Additional Information
More than 20,000 people received solid organ transplants (heart, lung, pancreas, kidney, liver, etc.) in the United States in 1995. CMV disease occurs in approximately 15-30% of all solid organ transplant recipients, primarily in the first three months post-transplantation when immunosuppression is most intense--and is a frequent cause of morbidity.
CMV, a member of the herpes family of viruses, infects approximately 50% of the U.S. adult population. In individuals with healthy immune systems, the virus remains in the body in a dormant state. However, among individuals with compromised immune systems, such as organ transplant recipients and people with AIDS, the virus can cause life-threatening and/or sight-threatening illness.
CMV in transplant recipients can cause a debilitating CMV syndrome (fever, malaise), and life-threatening invasive tissue disease (including hepatitis and pneumonia), and increased immunosuppression with resulting secondary infections.",
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis,Vistide (cidofovir),"General Information
Vistide was approved for the treatment for CMV retinitis in subjects with AIDS.
Vistide is known to have a much longer duration of activity than other antiviral treatments and therefore requires less frequent dosing. Vistide was administered in clinical studies only once every other week after a two-dose induction and does not require a chronic catheter for administration.
Clinical Results
This approval was based upon data from two pivotal studies demonstrating that Vistide delays the time to progression of CMV retinitis. These studies were conducted in subjects with CMV retinitis and AIDS. One study enrolled newly diagnosed subjects who had not received prior CMV treatment and the other study enrolled subjects with relapsing disease that had progressed despite extensive treatments with other intravenous therapies for CMV retinitis.
A third clinical study of Vistide is being conducted by an independent NIH-sponsored research group, the Studies of Ocular Complications of AIDS (SOCA). In March 1996, enrollment of new subjects in this study was stopped based upon an interim analysis of safety and efficacy data suggesting Vistide delayed the time to progression of CMV retinitis.
","Side Effects
The major toxicity of Vistide is renal impairment. The potential for nephrotoxicity can be minimized with the administration of probenecid tablets and hydration on the day of each Vistide infusion. In addition, laboratory measurements of a subject's urine protein and serum creatinine, a blood marker of kidney function, are monitored before each dose of Vistide. Proper use of these tests can guide physicians to adjust the Vistide dosage and minimize the potential for toxicity.
","Additional Information
CMV retinitis is caused by a viral infection that, if untreated progresses rapidly, affects a subject's vision over time, and may ultimately lead to blindness. It is estimated that up to 40% of subjects with AIDS may develop retinitis and that 95% of subjects with AIDS are infected with CMV. As people with AIDS live longer, the incidence of CMV retinitis has been increasing.
When CMV invades the retina, lesions form on the light-sensitive layer of cells at the back of the eye that transmit images to the brain. As these CMV lesions progress, the subjectâ€™s vision deteriorates over time.",
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis,Vitrasert Implant,"General Information
Vitrasert has been approved for treatment of CMV in subjects with AIDS. The implant releases ganciclovir to the site of disease in the eye in which it is implanted.
The Vitrasert Implant, surgically placed in the posterior segment of the eye, allows diffusion of drug (ganciclovir) locally to the site of infection over an extended period of months. Implantation normally takes less than one hour, requires only local anesthesia, and is conducted in an outpatient, day-surgery setting.
Immediately following insertion of the implant, most subjects experience transient blurred vision in the operated eye, which generally clears within two to four weeks. The implant can be removed when depleted of drug, usually within five to eight months, and a new Vitrasert Implant can be inserted.
Subjects with a Vitrasert implanted unilaterally should be continuously monitored for the development of disease in the other eye or for development of non-ocular CMV manifestations.
Clinical Results
Data from Chiron Vision's phase III trial of 188 AIDS subjects with newly diagnosed CMV retinitis have demonstrated that time to disease progression was significantly delayed for subjects who received Vitrasert, compared with those on intravenous (I.V.) ganciclovir. The study showed that eyes in the primary analysis group treated with Vitrasert had a median time to progression of 216 days, versus 104 days for eyes on I.V. treatment.
In addition, results of a clinical study reported by the National Eye Institute (NEI) in the Archives of Ophthalmology showed that the median time to progression of peripheral CMV retinitis in newly diagnosed patients who received the implant was about eight months, or 226 days. Those who received no immediate treatment or those assigned to defer treatment progressed in approximately 15 days.
",,"Additional Information
CMV retinitis affects an estimated 15% to 40% of people with AIDS. CMV retinitis usually begins as a white infiltrate within the retina, and can progress rapidly to cause destruction of retinal tissue. Retinal damage can lead to detachment of the retina, occurring in 15% to 29% of subjects with AIDS-related CMV retinitis, and permanent loss of vision.",
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis,Vitravene Injection,"General Information
Vitravene Injection for the local treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who are intolerant of or have a contraindication to other treatment(s) for CMV retinitis or who were insufficiently responsive to previous treatment(s) for CMV retinitis.
The use of Vitravene does not provide treatment for systemic CMV disease.
Clinical Results
Vitravene injection is not a cure for CMV retinitis, and some immunocompromised patients may continue to experience progression of retinitis during and following treatment. Patients receiving Vitravene should be advised to have regular ophthalmologic follow-up examinations. Patients may also experience other manifestations of CMV disease despite Vitravene therapy.

Prevymis is specifically indicated for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
Prevymis is supplied as a tablet for oral administration and as a solution for intravenous injection. The recommended dose is 480 mg administered once daily orally or as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 1 hour through 100 days post-transplant. Dosage Adjustment: If Prevymis is co-administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of Prevymis should be decreased to 240 mg once daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Prevymis is based on a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III Trial in adult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Subjects were randomized to receive either Prevymis at a dose of 480 mg once daily adjusted to 240 mg when coadministered with cyclosporine, or placebo. Randomization was stratified by investigational site and risk level for CMV reactivation at the time of study entry. Study drug was initiated after HSCT (at any time from Day 0 to Day 28 post-transplant) and continued through Week 14 post-transplant. Study drug was administered either orally or intravenously; the dose of Prevymis was the same regardless of the route of administration. Subjects received CMV DNA monitoring weekly until post-transplant Week 14 and then bi-weekly until post-transplant Week 24, with initiation of standard-of-care CMV pre-emptive therapy if CMV viremia was considered clinically significant. The data show that significantly fewer subjects taking the drug (38 percent) compared to those given a placebo (61 percent) developed clinically significant CMV infection, discontinued treatment or had missing data through Week 24 post-HSCT. In addition, all-cause mortality in patients receiving Prevymis was lower compared to placebo at 12 percent versus 17 percent, respectively, 24 weeks post-transplant.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Prevymis may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Avycaz was supported in part by the previous findings of the efficacy and safety of ceftazidime for the treatment of cIAI and cUTI. The contribution of avibactam to Avycaz was primarily established in vitro and in animal models of infection. Avycaz was studied in two phase II randomized, blinded, active-controlled, multicenter trials, one each in cIAI and cUTI, including pyelonephritis. These trials were not designed with any formal hypotheses for inferential testing against the active comparators.
The FDA approval of Avycaz for use in pediatric patients was based on results from two active-controlled clinical studies evaluating Avycaz in children or infants with cIAI or cUTI, as well as a single-dose pharmacokinetic study. In the cIAI study, the safety and efficacy of Avycaz (in combination with metronidazole) was compared with meropenem. In the cUTI study, Avycaz was compared with cefepime. Across the trials, 128 pediatric patients 3 months to less than 18 years of age were treated with Avycaz. In the pediatric cIAI study, the clinical cure rate at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 91.8% (56/61) in the Avycaz plus metronidazole group and 95.5% (21/22) in the meropenem group. Clinical cure rates for the predominant pathogens, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 90.5% and 85.7%, respectively for patients treated with Avycaz plus metronidazole, and 92.3% and 88.9%, respectively, for patients treated with meropenem. In the pediatric cUTI study, the combined favorable clinical and microbiological response rate at TOC in the microbiological-ITT population was 72.2% (39/54) in the Avycaz group and 60.9% (14/23) in the cefepime group. The microbiologic response rate for E.coli, the most common uropathogen identified in the study, was 79.6% for patients treated with Avycaz and 59.1% for patients treated with cefepime.

Bacterial Infections,Orbactiv (oritavancin),"General Information
Orbactiv (oritavancin) is a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide antibacterial drug. It exerts concentration-dependent bactericidal activity in vitro against S. aureus, S. pyogenes, and E. faecalis.
Orbactiv is specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by susceptible isolates of the following Gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and methicillinâ€“resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus group (includes S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. constellatus), and Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only).
Orbactiv is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion. The recommended dose is a single 1200 mg dose administered by intravenous infusion over three hours in patients 18 years and older. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Orbactiv and other antibacterial drugs, Orbactiv should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Orbactiv was based on two identically designed, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, multinational, non-inferiority trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2). The trials enrolled 1,987 adults with clinically documented ABSSSI suspected or proven to be due to Gram-positive pathogens. A single 1200 mg intravenous dose of Orbactiv was compared to intravenous vancomycin (1 g or 15 mg/kg every 12 hours) for 7 to 10 days. The primary analysis population (modified intent to treat, mITT) included all randomized patients who received any study drug. The primary endpoint in both trials was early clinical response (responder), defined as cessation of spread or reduction in size of baseline lesion, absence of fever, and no rescue antibacterial drug at 48 to 72 hours after initiation of therapy. Data showed Orbactiv was as effective as Vancomycin in treating the infections. Trial 1: Orbactiv: 82.3% responders and Vancomycin: 78.9% responders.

Orbactiv (oritavancin) is a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide antibacterial drug. It exerts concentration-dependent bactericidal activity in vitro against S. aureus, S. pyogenes, and E. faecalis. Oritavancin has three mechanisms of action: (i) inhibition of the transglycosylation (polymerization) step of cell wall biosynthesis by binding to the stem peptide of peptidoglycan precursors; (ii) inhibition of the transpeptidation (crosslinking) step of cell wall biosynthesis by binding to the peptide bridging segments of the cell wall; and (iii) disruption of bacterial membrane integrity, leading to depolarization, permeabilization, and cell death. These multiple mechanisms contribute to the concentration-dependent bactericidal activity of oritavancin.

Dosing of the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid can be extended beyond 26 weeks, if necessary.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The Nix-TB trial was an open-label study conducted in three centers in South Africa in patients with XDR, treatment-intolerant MDR, or non-responsive MDR pulmonary TB. The patients received a combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid for 6 months (extended to 9 months in 2 patients) with 24 months of follow-up; linezolid starting dose was either 600 mg twice daily or 1200 mg once daily. One hundred seven of the 109 patients enrolled were assessable for the primary efficacy analyses with two patients remaining in follow-up for the primary outcome assessment. Treatment failure was defined as the incidence of bacteriologic failure (reinfection â€“ culture conversion to positive status with different M. tuberculosis strain), bacteriological relapse (culture conversion to positive status with same M. tuberculosis strain), or clinical failure through follow-up until 6 months after the end of treatment. Of the 107 patients assessed, outcomes were classified as success for 95 (89%) patients and failure for 12 (11%) patients.

Pretomanid is a nitroimidazooxazine antimycobacterial drug. Pretomanid kills actively replicating M. tuberculosis by inhibiting mycolic acid biosynthesis, thereby blocking cell wall production. Under anaerobic conditions, against non-replicating bacteria, pretomanid acts as a respiratory poison following nitric oxide release. All of these activities require nitro-reduction of pretomanid within the mycobacterial cell by the deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase, Ddn, which is dependent on the reduced form of the cofactor F420. Reduction of F420 is accomplished by the F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Recarbrio is specifically indicated for the following:
â€¢ Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including Pyelonephritis, in patients 18 years of age and older who have limited or no alternative treatment options, for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, caused by the following susceptible gram-negative microorganisms: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
â€¢ Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (cIAI) in patients 18 years of age and older who have limited or no alternative treatment options for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by the following susceptible gram-negative microorganisms: Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides stercoris, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Parabacteroides distasonis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Recarbrio is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion. The recommended dose is 1.25 grams (imipenem 500mg, cilastatin 500 mg, and relebactam 250 mg) administered by intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes every 6 hours in patients 18 years of age and older with creatinine clearance (CLcr) of 90 mL/min or greater. A dose reduction is recommended for patients with CLcr less than 90 mL/min. The severity and location of infection, as well as clinical response should guide the duration of therapy. Please see drug label for specific dose adjustments. The recommended duration of treatment with Recarbrio is 4 days to 14 days.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The determination of efficacy and safety of Recarbrio was supported in part by the previous findings of the efficacy and safety of imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of cIAI and cUTI. The contribution of relebactam to Recarbrio was primarily established in vitro and in animal models of infection. Imipenem/cilastatin plus relebactam was studied in cIAI and cUTI including pyelonephritis in randomized, blinded, active-controlled, multicenter trials. These trials provided only limited efficacy and safety information.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections or Recarbrio, please visit the Recarbrio web page.","Mechanism of Action
Recarbrio is a combination of imipenem, a penem antibacterial, cilastatin, a renal dehydropeptidase inhibitor, and relebactam, a betalactamase inhibitor. Cilastatin limits the renal metabolism of imipenem and does not have antibacterial activity. The bactericidal activity of imipenem results from binding to PBP 2 and PBP 1B in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the subsequent inhibition of penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Inhibition of PBPs leads to the disruption of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Imipenem is stable in the presence of some beta lactamases. Relebactam has no intrinsic antibacterial activity. Relebactam protects imipenem from degradation by certain serine beta lactamases such as Sulhydryl Variable (SHV), Temoneira (TEM), Cefotaximase-Munich (CTX-M), Enterobacter cloacae P99 (P99), Pseudomonas-derived cephalosporinase (PDC), and Klebsiella-pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC).

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Sirturo was based on two studies.
Study 1
The placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial enrolled 160 newly diagnosed patients with multi-drug resistant pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Subjects were randomized to receive treatment with either Sirturo or placebo, both with other drugs used to treat MDR-TB. Sirturo was administered as 400 mg once daily for the first 2 weeks and as 200 mg 3 times per week for the following 22 weeks. After the 24-week Sirturo or placebo treatment phase, subjects continued to receive their other drugs used to treat MDR-TB until a total treatment duration of 18 to 24 months. The Sirturo treatment group had a decreased time to culture conversion and improved culture conversion rates compared to the placebo treatment group at Week 24. Treatment success was reached by 77.6% of the Sirturo arm versus 57.6% of the placebo arm at Week 24 (p=0.014). At Week 72 success was reached by 70.1% and 56.1% of the respective arms. Median time to culture conversion was 83 days for the Sirturo treatment group compared to 125 days for the placebo treatment group.

Sivextro (tedizolid phosphate) is an antibacterial agent of the oxazolidinone class.The antibacterial activity of tedizolid is mediated by binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis. Tedizolid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis through a mechanism of action different from that of other non-oxazolidinone class antibacterial drugs; therefore, cross-resistance between tedizolid and other classes of antibacterial drugs is unlikely. The results of in vitro time-kill studies show that tedizolid is bacteriostatic against enterococci, staphylococci, and streptococci.

Batten Disease,Brineura (cerliponase alfa),"General Information
Brineura (cerliponase alfa) is a hydrolytic lysosomal N-terminal tripeptidyl peptidase.
Brineura is specifically indicated to slow the loss of ambulation in symptomatic pediatric patients 3 years of age and older with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), also known as tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) deficiency.
Brineura is supplied as an injection for intraventricular administration. Pre-treatment of patients with antihistamines with or without antipyretics or corticosteroids is recommended 30 to 60 minutes prior to the start of infusion.The recommended dosage is 300 mg administered once every other week as an intraventricular infusion followed by infusion of Intraventricular Electrolytes over approximately 4.5 hours. For complete information on preparation, specific intraventricular access device for use, and administration, see the full prescribing information.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Brineura was based on a non-randomized single-arm dose escalation clinical study with extension in symptomatic pediatric patients with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, confirmed by TPP1 deficiency. Brineura-treated patients were compared to untreated patients from a natural history cohort. The Motor domain of a CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale was used to assess disease progression. Scores ranged from 3 (grossly normal) to 0 (profoundly impaired) with unit decrements representing milestone events in the loss of motor function (ability to walk or crawl). Twenty-four patients, aged 3 to 8 years were enrolled in the Brineura single-arm clinical study. One patient withdrew after week 1 due to inability to continue with study procedures; 23 patients were treated with Brineura 300 mg every other week for 48 weeks, and continued treatment during the extension period. In the clinical study with extension, patients were assessed for decline in the Motor domain of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale at 48, 72 and 96 weeks. Decline was defined as having an unreversed (sustained) 2category decline or an unreversed score of 0 in the Motor domain of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale. Patientsâ€™ responses to Brineura treatment were evaluated if at screening a combined Motor plus Language CLN2 score of less than 6 was recorded. Two patients with a combined Motor plus Language CLN2 score of 6 were excluded from the analyses; they maintained that score throughout the study period. Motor scores of the 22 Brineura-treated patients in the clinical study with extension were compared to scores of the independent natural history cohort that included 42 untreated patients who satisfied inclusion criteria for the clinical study. The results of logistic modeling with covariates (screening age, screening motor score, genotype: 0 key mutations (yes/no)), demonstrated the odds of Brineura-treated patients not having a decline by 96 weeks were 13 times the odds of natural history cohort patients not having a decline (Odds Ratio (95% CI): 13.1 (1.2, 146.9)). Descriptive non-randomized comparison In an unadjusted non-randomized comparison, of the 22 patients treated with Brineura and evaluated for efficacy at week 96, 21 (95%) did not decline, and only the patient who terminated early was deemed to have a decline in the Motor domain of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale. Results from the natural history cohort demonstrated progressive decline in motor function; of the 42 patients in the natural history cohort 21 (50%) experienced an unreversed (sustained) 2-category decline or unreversed score of 0 in the Motor domain of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale over 96 weeks. To further assess efficacy, the 22 patients from the Brineura clinical study with a baseline combined Motor plus Language CLN2 score less than 6 were matched to 42 patients in the natural history cohort. Patients were matched based on the following covariates: baseline age at time of screening within 3 months, genotype (0, 1, or 2 key mutations), and baseline Motor domain CLN2 score at time of screening. Using the Motor domain of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale, decline was defined as having an unreversed 2-category decline or an unreversed score of 0. At 96 weeks, the matched analysis based on 17 pairs demonstrated fewer declines in the Motor domain for Brineura-treated patients compared to untreated patients in the natural history cohort.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Brineura or late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2, please visit http://brineura.com/","Mechanism of Action
Brineura (cerliponase alfa) is a hydrolytic lysosomal N-terminal tripeptidyl peptidase. CLN2 disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (TPP1), which catabolizes polypeptides in the CNS. TPP1 has no known substrate specificity. Deficiency in TPP1 activity results in the accumulation of lysosomal storage materials normally metabolized by this enzyme in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to progressive decline in motor function. Cerliponase alfa (rhTTP1), a proenzyme, is taken up by target cells in the CNS and is translocated to the lysosomes through the Cation Independent Mannose-6-Phosphate Receptor (CI-MPR, also known as M6P/IGF2 receptor). Cerliponase alfa is activated in the lysosome and the activated proteolytic form of rhTPP1 cleaves tripeptides from the N-terminus of proteins.

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (Enlarged Prostate),Dutasteride,"General Information
Dutasteride capsules have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate gland. Dutasteride is a dual 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, blocking both type 1 and type 2 5-alpha-reductase isoenzymes. These enzymes are responsible for converting testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the prostate. In turn, high levels of DTH may accumulate and cause hyperplasia.
BPH is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, which can lead to the development of lower urinary tract symptoms. According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, more than half of men in their sixties and as many as 90% in their seventies and eighties have some symptoms of BPH. Symptoms of BPH vary, but can include urination problems such as urgency and leaking or dribbling, or more frequent urination, especially at night.

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (Enlarged Prostate),Jalyn (dutasteride + tamsulosin),"General Information
Jalyn is a single-capsule combination of dutasteride (0.5 mg) and tamsulosin (0.4 mg) Dutasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. Tamsulosin is an alpha-blocker and works by relaxing the muscles in the bladder and prostate.
Jalyn capsules are specifically indicated for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia in men with an enlarged prostate.
Jalyn is supplied as a capsule designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 1 capsule (0.5 mg dutasteride and 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride) taken once daily approximately 30 minutes after the same meal each day.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Jalyn was based on two-year results from the CombAT (Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin) study. This international multicenter, randomized, double-blind and parallel-group study enrolled 4,844 men with moderate-to-severe BPH symptoms. The subjects were randomized to receive dutasteride 0.5 mg/day plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day, dutasteride 0.5 mg/day or tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day. The study compared changes in urinary symptoms seen with dutasteride co-administered with tamsulosin as opposed to either medicine alone. Changes were measured via a validated symptom index. Over 24 months, Avodart and tamsulosin combination therapy provided a significantly greater improvement in symptoms from baseline than either Avodart or tamsulosin treatment alone (p < 0.001). In addition, Avodart resulted in continuous and sustained Qmax (urine flow rate) improvements to month 24. Treatment was well tolerated, with adverse events similar between all the treatment groups. Long-term (four-year) results showed that combined treatment with Avodart and tamsulosin significantly reduced the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) or BPH-related surgery by 66% compared with tamsulosin alone (p<0.001). The combination therapy also significantly reduced the risk of BPH disease progression by 44% compared with tamsulosin and 31% compared with dutasteride alone. In addition, those treated with combination therapy reported a significant improvement in BPH symptoms at 4 years, as measured by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), with a mean change from baseline of -6.3 points, compared to -3.8 for tamsulosin and -5.3 for dutasteride alone.

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (Enlarged Prostate),UroXatral (alfuzosin HCl extended-release tablets),"General Information
UroXatral (alfuzosin HCl extended-release) tablets belongs to a class of drugs called alpha-blockers. It is used in adult men to treat the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). UroXatral may help to relax the muscles in the prostate and the bladder, which may lessen the symptoms of BPH and improve urine flow.
UroXatral is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. This drug is not indicated for the treatment of hypertension.
The active ingredient, alfuzosin, is marketed in more than 80 countries throughout Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. Outside of the United States, the once-daily formulation (Xatral OD) is registered in 70 countries worldwide; it is currently marketed in 14 countries in Europe and in more than 35 other countries.
Clinical Results
FDA approval is based on three randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-arm, 12-week studies. The studies enrolled 1,608 subjects of which 473 subjects received UroXatral 10 mg daily. The pharmacokinetics of UroXatral have been evaluated in adult healthy male volunteers after single and/or multiple administration with daily doses ranging from 7.5 mg to 30 mg, and in patients with BPH at doses from 7.5 mg to 15 mg.
The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS, or AUA Symptom Score) consists of seven questions that assess the severity of both irritative (frequency, urgency, nocturia) and obstructive (incomplete emptying, stopping and starting, weak stream, and pushing or straining) symptoms, with possible scores ranging from 0 to 35. Results showed a statistically significant reduction from baseline to last assessment (Week 12) in the IPSS versus placebo in all three studies, indicating a reduction in symptom severity. The second efficacy variable was peak urinary flow rate. Peak urinary flow rate increased statistically significantly from baseline to last assessment (Week 12) versus placebo in studies 1 and 2. Mean total IPSS decreased at the first scheduled observation at Day 28 and mean peak flow rate increased starting at the first scheduled observation at Day 14 in studies 2 and 3 and Day 28 in study 1.

Bipolar Disorder,Saphris (asenapine),"General Information
Saphris (asenapine) is a sublingual psychotropic agent. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. However, it has been suggested that the efficacy of asenapine in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of antagonist activity at D2 and 5-HT2A receptors.
Saphris is specifically indicated for the acute treatment of schizophrenia in adults and for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder with or without psychotic features in adults.
Saphris is supplied as a tablet for sublingual administration.
The recommended initial dose of the drug for schizophrenia is as follows:
Usual Dose for Acute Treatment in Adults
The recommended starting and target dose of Saphris is 5mg given twice daily. The safety of doses above 10mg twice daily has not been evaluated in clinical studies.
Maintenance Treatment
There is no available evidence regarding how long the schizophrenic patient should remain on Saphris. It is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response.
The recommended initial dose of the drug for Bipolar Disorder is as follows:
Usual Dose for Acute Treatment in Adults:
The recommended starting dose of Saphris is 10mg twice daily. The dose can be decreased to 5mg twice daily if there are adverse effects. The safety of doses above 10mg twice daily has not been evaluated in clinical trials.

There is no available evidence regarding how long the bipolar patient should remain on Saphris. It is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Saphris was based on the following studies:
Schizophrenia
Three fixed-dose, short-term (6 week), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled (haloperidol, risperidone, and olanzapine) trials enrolled adult patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and were having an acute exacerbation of their schizophrenic illness. The primary efficacy rating scale was the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The primary endpoint was change from baseline to endpoint on the PANSS total score.
Trial One
This study enrolled 174 subjects and compared Saphris (5 mg twice daily) to placebo, Saphris was statistically superior to placebo on the PANSS total score.
Trial Two
This trial enrolled 448 subjects and compared two fixed doses of Saphris (5mg and 10mg twice daily) to placebo. Saphris 5 mg twice daily was statistically superior to placebo on the PANSS total score. Saphris 10mg twice daily showed no added benefit compared to 5mg twice daily and was not significantly different from placebo.
Trial Three
Saphris could not be distinguished from placebo; however, an active control in this trial was superior to placebo.
Bipolar Disorder
Two similarly designed 3-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled (olanzapine) trials enrolled adult patients who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with an acute manic or mixed episode with or without psychotic features. The subjects received placebo or Saphris, initially administered 10 mg twice daily. The dose could be adjusted within the dose range of 5 to 10 mg twice daily from Day 2 onward based on efficacy and tolerability. Ninety percent of patients remained on the 10 mg twice daily dose.

Bipolar Disorder,Stavzor (valproic acid delayed release),"General Information
Stavzor is an enteric, anticonvulsant, delayed-release, softgel capsule formulation of valproic acid. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, however, valproate is believed to affect the function of the neurotransmitter GABA (as a GABA transaminase inhibitor). GABA plays a role in regulating neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system. GABA is also directly responsible for the regulation of muscle tone. Valproic acid also blocks the voltage-gated sodium channels and T-type Calcium channels and is an inhibitor of the enzyme histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1).
Stavzor is specifically indicated for the treatment of the manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years with complex partial seizures that occur either in isolation or in association with other types of seizures, for the treatment of simple and complex absence seizures and for prophylaxis of migraine headaches.
Stavzor is supplied as 125-mg, 250-mg or 500-mg capsules designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is:
Mania
750 mg daily in divided doses. The dose should be increased as rapidly as possible to achieve the lowest therapeutic dose which produces the desired clinical effect or the desired range of plasma concentrations. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day.
Seizures-Complex Partial Seizures
For adults and children 10 years of age or older
Monotherapy
Initial therapy should be 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. The recommended maximum dose is 60 mg/kg/day.
Conversion to Monotherapy
Therapy should be initiated at at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. The maximum recommended dose is 60 mg/kg/day.
Adjunctive Therapy
Therapy should be initiated at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. The maximum recommended dose is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in 2 to 3 doses.
Simple and Complex Absence Seizures
Therapy should be initiated at 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at 1-week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in 2 to 3 doses.
Migraine
The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily. Some patients may benefit from doses up to 1000 mg/day.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Stavzor was based on the following clinical trials:
Mania
Stavzor was evaluated in two 3-week, placebo controlled, parallel group studies.
Study One
This study enrolled adult subjects who received valproate at a dose of 250 mg TID and adjusted to achieve serum valproate concentrations in a range of 50-100 mcg/mL by day 7. The treatment period was three weeks (21 days). The subjects were subsequently assessed on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS; score ranges from 0-60), an augmented Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-A), and the Global Assessment Scale (GAS). Valproate was statistically significantly superior to placebo on all three measures of outcome. Sixty percent of the subjects showed at least a 30% reduction in symptom score from baseline compared to 26% of the placebo group (p<0.05).
Study Two
This study enrolled adult subjects who received valproate at a dose of 250 mg TID and adjusted within a dose range of 750-2500 mg/day to achieve serum valproate concentrations in a range of 40-150 mcg/mL. The treatment duration was three weeks (21 days). Study 2 also included a lithium group for which lithium doses for completers were 1312, 1869, and 1984 mg/day at Days 7, 14, and 21, respectively. Subjects were assessed on the Manic Rating Scale (MRS; score ranges from 11-63), and the primary outcome measures were the total MRS score, and scores for 2 subscales of the MRS. Valproate was statistically significantly superior to placebo on all three measures of outcome. Fifty-eight percent of the subjects showed at least a 30% reduction in symptom score from baseline compared to 29% of the placebo group (p<0.05).
Epilepsy
Stavzor was evaluated in two clinical trials.
Study One
This multiclinic, placebo-controlled study employing an add-on design, (adjunctive therapy), enrolled 144 subjects who continued to suffer 8 or more controlled partial seizures (CPS) per 8 weeks during an 8week period of monotherapy with doses of either carbamazepine or phenytoin. The subjects were randomized to receive either valproate or placebo in addition to their original antiepilepsy drug. They were followed for 16 weeks. The results are as follows: the median baseline incidence of CPS per 8 weeks was 16.0 for the valproate arm and 14.5 for the placebo arm. Following treatment, the median was reduced to 8.9 for the valproate arm and 11.5 for the placebo arm. The reduction from baseline was statistically significantly greater for valproate than placebo (p < 0.05).
Study Two
This study was designed to assess the capacity of valproate to reduce the incidence of CPS when administered as the sole AED. All enrolled subjects experienced 2 or more CPS per 4 weeks during an 8- to 12 weeklong period of monotherapy with adequate doses of an AED and made a successful transition over a 2 week interval to valproate. The subjects gradually tapered off their concomitant AED, were randomized to either a high dose or low dose valproate group (mean total of 71 and 123 mcg/mL) and followed for as long as 22 weeks. The monotherapy study median incidence of CPS per 8 weeks at baseline was 13.2 in the high dose arm and 14.2 in the low dose arm. Following treatment, the median CPS incidence was reduced to 10.7 in the high dose arm and 13.8 in the low dose arm. The reduction from baseline was statistically significantly greater for high dose than low dose (p = 0.05).
Migraine
Stavzor was evaluated in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Both studies enrolled subjects with a history of migraine with or without aura (of at least 6 months in duration) who were experiencing at least 2 migraine headaches a month during the 3 months prior to enrollment. Each study was comprised of a 4-week single-blind placebo baseline period after which they were randomized, under double blind conditions, to valproate or placebo for a 12-week treatment phase, comprised of a 4-week dose titration period followed by an 8-week maintenance period.
Study One
This study enrolled 107 subjects, 90 of whom completed the 8-week maintenance period. Valproate doses ranged from 500 to 2500 mg a day. Doses over 500 mg were given in three divided doses (TID). The mean dose during the treatment phase was 1087 mg/day. The mean 4-week migraine headache rate during the treatment phase was 5.7 in the placebo group compared to 3.5 in the valproate group, a significant difference.
Study Two
This study enrolled 176 subjects, 137 of whom completed the 8-week maintenance period. The subjects were randomized equally to one of three valproate dose groups (500, 1000, or 1500 mg/day) or placebo. The treatments were given in two divided doses (BID). The initial dose was 250 mg daily. The regimen was advanced by 250 mg every 4 days (8 days for 500 mg/day group), until the randomized dose was achieved. Efficacy was determined by a comparison of the 4-week migraine headache rate in the combined 1000/1500 mg/day group and placebo group. The mean 4-week migraine headache rates during the treatment phase, adjusted for differences in baseline rates, were 4.5 in the placebo group, compared to 3.3, 3.0, and 3.3 in the valproate 500, 1000, and 1500 mg/day groups, respectively. The rates in the combined valproate 1000/1500 mg group were significantly lower than in the placebo group.

Please see drug label for dosage adjustments for CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Vraylar was based on the following trials:
Schizophrenia:
Three, 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in patients (aged 18 to 60 years) who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for schizophrenia. An active control arm (risperidone or aripiprazole) was included in two trials to assess assay sensitivity. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at the end of week 6. The change from baseline for Vraylar and active control groups was compared to placebo. The secondary endpoint was based on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) rating scale.
Study 1: In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 711) involving three fixed doses of Vraylar (1.5, 3, or 4.5 mg/day) and an active control (risperidone), all Vraylar doses and the active control were superior to placebo on the PANSS total score and the CGI-S.
Study 2: In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 604) involving two fixed doses of Vraylar (3 or 6 mg/day) and an active control (aripiprazole), both Vraylar doses and the active control were superior to placebo on the PANSS total score and the CGI-S.
Study 3: In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 439) involving two flexible-dose range groups of Vraylar (3 to 6 mg/day or 6 to 9 mg/day), both Vraylar groups were superior to placebo on the PANSS total score and the CGI-S.
The efficacy of Vraylar was demonstrated at doses ranging from 1.5 to 9 mg/day compared to placebo. There was, however, a dose-related increase in certain adverse reactions, particularly above 6 mg. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose is 6 mg/day.
Manic or Mixed Episodes Associated with Bipolar I disorder:
Three, 3-week placebo-controlled trials were conducted in patients (mean age of 39 years, range 18 to 65 years) who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for bipolar 1 disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or without psychotic features. Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale (CGI-S) were used as the primary and secondary efficacy measures, respectively, for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in each trial. The primary endpoint was decrease from baseline in YMRS total score at the end of week 3. The change from baseline for each Vraylar dose group was compared to placebo.
Study 1: In a 3-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 492) involving two flexible-dose range groups of Vraylar (3 to 6 mg/day or 6 to 12 mg/day), both Vraylar dose groups were superior to placebo on the YMRS total score and the CGI-S. The 6 to 12 mg/day dose group showed no additional advantage.
Study 2: In a 3-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 235) involving a flexible-dose range of Vraylar (3 to 12 mg/day), Vraylar was superior to placebo on the YMRS total score and the CGI-S.
Study 3: In a 3-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 310) involving a flexible-dose range of Vraylar (3 to 12 mg/day), Vraylar was superior to placebo on the YMRS total score and the CGI-S.
The efficacy of Vraylar was established at doses ranging from 3 to 12 mg/day. Doses above 6 mg did not appear to have additional benefit over lower doses and there was a dose-related increase in certain adverse reactions. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose is 6 mg/day.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Vraylar may include, but are not limited to, the following:
extrapyramidal symptoms
akathisia
dyspepsia
vomiting
somnolence

Bladder Cancer,Keytruda (pembrolizumab),"General Information
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD 1)-blocking, humanized monoclonal antibody.
Keytruda is specifically indicated for 1) the first line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and whose tumors express PD-L1 [Combined Positive Score (CPS)â‰¥10] as determined by an FDA-approved test, or in patients who are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 status and 2) for the second line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.
Keytruda is supplied as a solution for intravenous injection. The recommended dose of Keytruda is 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Keytruda was based on results from the KEYNOTE-052 Phase 2 trial and the KEYNOTE-045 Phase 3 trial.
KEYNOTE-052 included 370 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were not eligible for Platinol-containing chemotherapy. All participants received Keytruda once every three weeks for up to 24 weeks, unless they presented signs of treatment-related toxicity. The treatment had an objective response rate (ORR) of 29%, including 7% complete responses and 22% partial responses. The duration of response ranged from 1.4 to 17.8 months. At the time of the analysis, less than half of patients who responded had seen their disease progress again, hence the median duration of response was unattainable.
KEYNOTE-045 was a multicenter, placebo-controlled study in 542 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, whose disease progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive either Keytruda every three weeks or investigatorâ€™s choice chemotherapy. Chemotherapy regimens included Taxol (paclitaxel), Taxotere (docetaxel), or vinflunine. Overall, Keytruda treatment demonstrated a superior overall survival (OS) compared to the other treatment regimens, with a 27% reduction in the risk of death. Keytruda treatment resulted in a median OS of 10.3 months, compared to 7.4 months in the chemotherapy arm. No statistically significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) was observed between groups, with those receiving Keytruda having a median PFS of 2.1 months, compared to 3.3 months in the chemotherapy arm. Keytruda was also seen to improve objective response rate compared to chemotherapy regimens. The ORR was 21% in the Keytruda-treated group vs. 11% in the chemotherapy group.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Keytruda may include, but are not limited to, the following:
fatigue
musculoskeletal pain

Please Visit Inspire's Community Pages for this drug.","Mechanism of Action
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD 1)-blocking, humanized monoclonal IgG4 kappa antibody. Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response.

Bladder Cancer,Tecentriq (atezolizumab),"General Information
Tecentriq (atezolizumab) is a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody.
Tecentriq is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who:
Have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy
Have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy
Tecentriq is specifically indicated for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving Tecentriq.
Tecentriq is specifically indicated in combination with chemotherapy (Abraxane [paclitaxel protein-bound; nab-paclitaxel] and carboplatin) for the initial (first-line) treatment of adults with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations
Tecentriq is supplied as a solution for intravenous injection. The recommended dose is 1200 mg as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 3 weeks.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
urothelial carcinoma
The FDA approval of Tecentriq was based on a single-arm clinical trial involving 310 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This trial measured the percentage of patients who experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors (objective response rate). The study also looked at the difference in effect based on â€œpositiveâ€� versus â€œnegativeâ€� expression of the PD-L1 protein on patientsâ€™ tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In all patients, 14.8 percent of experienced at least a partial shrinkage of their tumors, an effect that lasted from more than 2.1 to more than 13.8 months at the time of the response analysis. In patients who were classified as â€œpositiveâ€� for PD-L1 expression, 26 percent experienced a tumor response, compared to 9.5 percent of patients who were classified as â€œnegativeâ€� for PD-L1 expression.
non-small cell lung cancer
The FDA approval of Tecentriq for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer was based on results from the randomized Phase III OAK and Phase II POPLAR studies. OAK was a global, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study which enrolled 1,225 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive either docetaxel (75 mg/m2 intravenous infusion) or Tecentriq (1200 mg intravenous infusion) every three weeks. Results from OAK showed that Tecentriq helped subjects in the overall study population live a median of 13.8 months, 4.2 months longer than those treated with docetaxel chemotherapy (median overall survival [OS]: 13.8 vs. 9.6 months). The study enrolled subjects regardless of their PD-L1 status and included both squamous and non-squamous disease types. POPLAR enrolled 287 subjects. The study showed Tecentriq doubled the likelihood of survival OS in subjects whose cancer expressed the highest levels of PD-L1 compared with docetaxel chemotherapy. An improvement in survival was also observed in subjects who had medium and high or any level of PD-L1 expression.
adults with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations
The FDA approval of Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in combination with chemotherapy (Abraxane [paclitaxel protein-bound; nab-paclitaxel] and carboplatin) for the initial (first-line) treatment of adults with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations was based on the Phase III IMpower130 study, which showed Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy helped people live significantly longer compared to chemotherapy alone (median overall survival [OS]=18.6 versus 13.9 months) in the intention-to-treat wild-type (ITT-WT) population. The Tecentriq-based combination also significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival [PFS]) compared with chemotherapy alone (median PFS=7.2 versus 6.5 months) in the ITT-WT population.

Bladder Carcinoma,Imfinzi (durvalumab),"General Information
Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody.
Imfinzi is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who:
ï‚·1) have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy
ï‚·2) have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy
Imfinzi is also specifically approved for patients with Stage III non-small cell lung cancer whose tumor cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) and whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy given at the same time as radiation therapy.
Imfinzi is supplied as an infusion for intravenous administration. The recommended dose is 10 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Please see drug label for treatment modifications.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
This indication was approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. The accelerated FDA approval of Imfinzi was based on the urothelial cancer cohort of a multicenter, multicohort, open-label clinical trial. This cohort consisted of 182 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who had progressed while on or after a platinum-based therapy, including those who progressed within 12 months of receiving therapy in a neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting. These patients had initiated durvalumab therapy at least 13 weeks prior to the data cut-off date. All patients received Imfinzi 10 mg/kg via intravenous infusion every 2 weeks for up to 12 months or until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tumor assessments were performed at Weeks 6, 12 and 16, then every 8 weeks for the first year and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), and duration of response (DoR). The ORR was 17% and the median DoR was not reached. Among the total 31 responding patients, 1s (45%) had ongoing responses of 6 months or longer and five (16%) had ongoing responses of 12 months or longer.
The FDA approval of Imfinzi for non-small cell lung cancer was based on the PACIFIC study in 713 patients with unresectable Stage 3 NSCLC who completed at least 2 cycles of concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation before starting study drug. Imfinzi was tested against placebo. The endpoints were progression free survival and overall survival. The median time for PFS was 16.8 months for 476 patients receiving Imfinzi compared with 5.6 months for 237 patients receiving placebo. Subjects in the Imfinzi arm had a 48% lower chance of lung cancer growing or spreading than those receiving placebo.

Please Visit Inspire's Community Pages for this drug.","Mechanism of Action
Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody. Expression of PD-L1 can be induced by inflammatory signals (e.g., IFN-gamma) and can be expressed on both tumor cells and tumor-associated immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and activation through interaction with PD-1 and CD80. By binding to its receptors, PD-L1 reduces cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation, and cytokine production. Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1Îº) monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80. Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions releases the inhibition of immune responses, without inducing antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity.

Detrol tablets have been approved for the treatment of overactive bladder.
Clinical Results
Results from three placebo-controlled, 12-week studies including almost 2,000 adult patients with overactive bladder symptoms showed a significant reduction, 15 to 21% in the median number of urinations per 24 hours, a significantly greater reduction than the change in placebo patients. In addition, incontinence episodes decreased by 50 to 56% from baseline in treated patients.",,,
Bladder Disorders,Detrol LA (tolterodine tartrate),"General Information
Detrol LA (tolterodine tartrate) is indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency and frequency. It is available by prescription only in a 2 and 4 mg extended release capsule formulation.
Clinical Results
Three placebo-controlled, 12 week studies were held involving a total of 339 patients who received Detrol 2 mg twice daily and 177 patients who received the placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (75%), with the mean age being 60 years of age (range 19-91). At their entrance into the study almost all patients perceived symptoms of urgency (98%) and increased frequency of micturitions (89%) and urge incontinence (83%). These characteristics were balanced across treatment groups for all three studies.
","Side Effects
The most common side effects include, but are not limited to:
dry mouth
dyspepsia
headache
constipation
xerophthalmia (eye disorder that results from a deficiency of vitamin A)
abnormal vision
Many of these side effects are expected of antimuscarinic agents. Detrol is present in the breast milk of nursing mice. It is not known if it is present in the milk of nursing mothers. This drug also causes increased fetal abnormalities in mice. No studies have been done with pregnant mothers. Therefore the drug should only used by pregnant mothers if the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
Detrol is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention, gastric retention, or uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma. Detrol is also contraindicated in patients who have showed hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.
Drug Interactions:
Pharmokinetic studies with patients concomitantly receiving cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin and clarithromycin) or antifungal agents (ketoconazole, itraconazole, and miconazole) have not been performed. Patients receiving cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors should not receive doses of Detrol greater than 1 mg twice daily. (From FDA Label)
",,"Mechanism of Action
Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. In the anesthetized cat, tolterodine shows a selectivity for the urinary bladder over salivary glands; however, the clinical relevance of this finding has not been established.
After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, a major pharmacologically active metabolite. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite exhibit a high specificity for the muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels.
Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function in healthy volunteers. The main effects following a 6.4-mg single dose of tolterodine were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with a potent antimuscarinic action on the lower urninary tract. (From FDA Label)"
Bladder Disorders,Gelnique (oxybutynin chloride),"General Information
Gelnique (oxybutynin chloride) is an antispasmodic, antimuscarinic agent. It acts as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at postganglionic muscarinic receptors, resulting in relaxation of bladder smooth muscle. In conditions characterized by involuntary detrusor contractions, cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases maximum urinary bladder capacity and increases the volume to first detrusor contraction.
Gelnique is specifically indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency.
Gelnique is supplied as a gel designed for topical administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is one sachet (a 1 gram unit dose (1.14 mL) of 100 mg/g) applied once daily to dry, intact skin on the abdomen, upper arms/shoulders, or thighs. Application sites should be rotated.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Gelnique was based on the results a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group 12-week study. The study entolled 789 subjects with symptomatic overactive bladder with an average of at least four incontinence episodes in a 3-day period and at least 8 micturitions per day. The subjects were randomized to daily applications of Gelnique 1 gram or matching placebo gel. Gelnique treatment resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the number of urinary incontinence episodes per day from baseline to endpoint (the primary efficacy endpoint) compared with placebo (p<0.0001) as well as a decrease in the average daily urinary frequency (p=0.0017) and an increase in the average urine volume per void (p=0.0018).

Bladder Disorders,Mesnex,"General Information
Mesnex Tablets are approved for use as a detoxifying agent to inhibit the hemorrhagic cystitis induced by Ifex (ifosfamide). This condition involves bladder problems, such as irritation due to blood being in the urine. Ifex is an antineoplastic drug used for treatment of testicular cancer. Along with Ifex, Mesnex Injection was approved for use in 1988.
Mesnex Tablets are to be used in a dosing regimen with Ifex and Mesnex Injection. If only using Mesnex Injection, the dosing regimen lasts eight hours. With the addition of Mesnex Tablets, it is reduced to six hours. Tablets also allow for quicker administration that can easily be done if not at home.
Clinical Results
Approval of Mesnex Tablets is supported by two clinical studies with over 100 cancer subjects receiving Ifex. Trials compared three intravenous doses of Mesnex to an initial intravenous dose followed by two oral doses for the prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis induced by treatment with Ifex. Both dosing regimens successfully reduced incidences of grade three or four hematuria, the primary efficacy endpoint.
Mesnex Tablets are given orally two and six hours after the co-administartion of Ifex and Mesnex Injection. Mesnex should only be prescribed along with Ifex.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Mesnex may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Nausea

Mesnex (mesna) was developed as a prophylactic agent to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis induced by Ifex (ifosfamide). Mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite, mesna disulfide, which then remains in the intravascular compartment and is rapidly eliminated by the kidneys. In the kidney, mesna disulfide is reduced to mesna, which reacts with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites, resulting in their detoxification. (From Mesnex Prescribing Information)

Trospium chloride acts as a direct antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in cholinergically innervated organs. It has been shown to have negligible affinity for nicotinic acteylcholine receptors at therapeutic doses, and to not easily cross the blood-brain barrier, yielding a localized, potent anticholinergic for peripheral targets. Its anticholinergic-parasympatholytic action reduces the tonus of smooth muscle in the bladder, effectively reducing the number of required voids, urge incontinence episodes, urge severity and improving retention, facilitating increased volume per void.

Bladder Disorders,Toviaz (fesoterodine fumarate),"General Information
Toviaz is an extended release tablet formulation of fesoterodine fumarate. Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle and stimulation of salivary secretion. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects.
Toviaz is specifically indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency.
Tovaiz is supplied as a a 4 mg or 8 mf extended release tablet. The recommended initla dose of the drug is 4 mg once daily. Based upon individual response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 8 mg once daily. The daily dose of Toviaz should not exceed 4 mg in patients with severe renal insufficiency (CLCR <30 mL/min) and patients taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Tovaiz was based on two phase III trials. These randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies enrolled 554 subjects who received placebo, 554 subjects who received Toviaz 4 mg/day, and 566 subjects who received Toviaz 8 mg/day. The primary efficacy endpoints were the mean change in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean change in the number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours.
Study One

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Toviaz or overactive bladder, please visit the Toviaz web page.","Mechanism of Action
Toviaz is an extended release tablet formulation of fesoterodine fumarate. Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle and stimulation of salivary secretion. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects.

Bladder Disorders,Vesicare (solifenacin succinate),"General Information
Vesicare oral tablets contain solifenacin, a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Antagonism at these receptors has been shown to reduce tonus (elastic tension) of the urinary bladder and slow parasympathetic contractions.
It is specifically indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency.
Vesicare is administered via an oral tablet of 5 mg once daily, with a possible increase in dosage, to 10 mg once daily, in subjects experiencing good tollerance. Dosing should occur with liquids, and tablets should not be crushed or broken prior to administration.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Vesicare was based upon four 12-week multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies. The studies enrolled a total of 3027 subjects with at least a 3 month history of increased urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and/or urge or mixed (predominantly urge) incontinence. Subjects in two of the trials received either 5 or 10 mg Vesicare or placebo once daily, and subjects in the other two received exclusively 10 mg or placebo once daily. All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open label long-term extension. All four trials found that Vesicare offered significantly better efficacy than placebo in both primary (mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours) and secondary (including mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition) endpoints.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Vesicare may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Dry mouth
Constipation
Blurred Vission
Urinary Retention
Dry Eyes
In addition, three serious intestinal complications (one fecal impaction, one colonic obstruction, and one intestinal obstruction) and one case of angioneurotic edema occurred among patients taking Vesicare in clinical trials. There was not a significant difference in the incidence of serious adverse events between subjects taking the drug for 12 weeks and 12 months.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Vesicare or overactive bladder, please contact the Vesicare Web Site","Mechanism of Action
Solifenacin acts as a direct antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in cholinergically innervated organs. Its anticholinergic-parasympatholytic action reduces the tonus of smooth muscle in the bladder, effectively reducing the number of required voids, urge incontinence episodes, urge severity and improving retention, facilitating increased volume per void.

Blood Cancer,Blincyto (blinatumomab),"General Information
Blincyto (blinatumomab) is an immunotherapy. It engages the bodyâ€™s T-cells, a type of white blood cell or lymphocyte, to destroy leukemia cells. The drug acts as a connector between a protein called CD19, which is found on the surface of most B-cell lymphoblasts, and CD3, a protein on T-cell lymphocytes.
Blincyto is specifically indicated for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Blincyto is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion. Hospitalization is recommended for the first 9 days of the first cycle and the first 2 days of the second cycle. For all subsequent cycle starts and reinitiation (eg, if treatment is interrupted for 4 or more hours), supervision by a healthcare professional or hospitalization is recommended. Do not flush the Blincyto infusion line, especially when changing infusion bags. Flushing when changing bags or at completion of infusion can result in excess dosage and complications. The recommended dosing schedule is as follows:
A single cycle of treatment of Blincyto consists of 4 weeks of continuous intravenous infusion followed by a 2-week treatment-free interval.
â€¢ For patients at least 45 kg in weight:
- In Cycle 1, administer Blincyto at 9 mcg/day on Days 1â€“7 and at 28 mcg/day on Days 8â€“28.
- For subsequent cycles, administer Blincyto at 28 mcg/day on Days 1â€“28.
â€¢ Allow for at least 2 weeks treatment-free between cycles of Blincyto.
â€¢ A treatment course consists of up to 2 cycles of Blincyto for induction followed by 3 additional cycles for consolidation treatment (up to a total of 5 cycles).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Blincyto was granted under accelerated approval conditions. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in subsequent trials. Accelerated approval was based on an open-label, multicenter, single-arm study in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B precursor ALL. Blincyto was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion. In the first cycle, the initial dose was 9 mcg/day for week 1, then 28 mcg/day for the remaining 3 weeks. The target dose of 28 mcg/day was administered in cycle 2 and subsequent cycles starting on day 1 of each cycle. Dose adjustment was possible in case of adverse events. The treated population included 185 patients who received at least 1 infusion of Blincyto; the median number of treatment cycles was 2. Patients who responded to Blincyto but later relapsed had the option to be retreated with Blincyto. Among treated patients, the median age was 39 years (range: 18 to 79 years), 63 out of 185 (34.1%) had undergone HSCT prior to receiving Blincyto, and 32 out of 185 (17.3%) had received more than 2 prior salvage therapies. The primary endpoint was the complete remission/complete remission with partial hematological recovery (CR/CRh) rate within 2 cycles of treatment with Blincyto. Seventy-seven out of 185 (41.6%) evaluable patients achieved CR/CRh within the first 2 treatment cycles, with the majority of responses (81%, 62 out of 77) occurring within cycle 1 of treatment. The HSCT rate among those who achieved CR/CRh was 39% (30 out of 77).
","Side Effects

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Blincyto or Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed /refractory B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, please visit www.amgen.com","Mechanism of Action
Blincyto (blinatumomab) is a bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T-cell engager that binds to CD19 expressed on the surface of cells of B-lineage origin and CD3 expressed on the surface of T cells. It activates endogenous T cells by connecting CD3 in the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex with CD19 on benign and malignant B cells. Blinatumomab mediates the formation of a synapse between the T cell and the tumor cell, upregulation of cell adhesion molecules, production of cytolytic proteins, release of inflammatory cytokines, and proliferation of T cells, which result in redirected lysis of CD19+ cells.

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Kcentra was based on a randomized, controlled Phase IIIb study in 212 evaluable subjects. The study compared Kcentra (4-factor PCC) and vitamin K with plasma and vitamin K for urgent warfarin reversal in patients with acute major bleeding. Kcentra achieved the endpoints of hemostatic efficacy with respect to the adequacy of stopping a major bleed assessed at 24 hours from the start of infusion (72.4% of patients receiving Kcentra versus 65.4% receiving plasma) and INR reduction (1.3) at 30 minutes post treatment (62.2% of patients receiving Kcentra versus 9.6% receiving plasma). The secondary endpoints included plasma levels of major clotting factors (Factors II, VII, IX, X, proteins C and S); time to INR correction; and safety and tolerability (including all-cause mortality). A single Kcentra infusion produced a rapid and sustained increase in plasma levelsof clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X within 30 minutes post-treatment (p values<0.0001) with 87 percent less volume (105 mL +/-37 mL versus 865 mL +/- 269 mL) than plasma. Additionally, infusion time with Kcentra was seven times faster than with plasma (24 minutes versus nearly 3 hours for plasma). The most common adverse reactions (frequency 2.8%) observed in subjects receiving Kcentra were headache, nausea/vomiting, arthralgia, and hypotension.

Blood Clots,Tretten (Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit [Recombinant]),"General Information
Tretten consists of Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant). Recombinant human Factor XIII (rFXIII) is integral in the formation of blood clots. In the absence of Factor XIII, loosely formed clots are developed, leading to bleeding complications.
Tretten is specifically indicated for the routine prophylaxis of bleeding in people with congenital factor XIII (FXIII) A-subunit deficiency.
Tretten is supplied as a solution for infusion. The recommended dose is monthly 35 IU/kg injections.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Tretten was based on a phase III trial in 41 subjects. Data showed that when compared to an historic control group of subjects who did not receive routine FXIII infusions, preventive treatment with monthly 35 IU/kg Tretten injections significantly decreased the number of treatment-requiring bleeding episodes. During the prophylaxis treatment period with Tretten (434 subject months), five bleeding episodes treated with FXIII-containing products were observed in four subjects. All five were associated with trauma. When calculated for all 41 subjects, this translated into a mean annual rate of bleeding episodes that required treatment of 0.14 per subject year, which was statistically significantly lower than the historic bleeding rate of 1.68 per subject year for on-demand treatment.

Reblozyl (luspatercept-aamt) is an erythroid maturation agent.
Reblozyl is specifically indicated for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with beta thalassemia who require regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions.
Reblozyl is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous administration. The recommended starting dose of Reblozyl is 1 mg/kg once every 3 weeks by subcutaneous injection.
If a planned administration of Reblozyl is delayed or missed, administer Reblozyl as soon as possible and continue dosing as prescribed, with at least 3 weeks between doses. Assess and review hemoglobin (Hgb) results prior to each administration. If an RBC transfusion occurred prior to dosing, the pretransfusion Hgb must be considered for dosing purposes.
If the pre-dose Hgb is greater than or equal to 11.5 g/dL and the Hgb level is not influenced by recent transfusion, delay dosing until the Hgb is less than or equal to 11 g/dL.
If a patient does not achieve a reduction in RBC transfusion burden after at least 2 consecutive doses (6 weeks) at the 1 mg/kg starting dose, increase the Reblozyl dose to 1.25 mg/kg. Do not increase the dose beyond the maximum dose of 1.25 mg/kg.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Reblozyl was based on the phase 3 BELIEVE trial. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 336 patients with beta thalassemia requiring regular red blood cell transfusions (6-20 RBC units per 24 weeks) with no transfusion-free period greater than 35 days during that period who were randomized 2:1 to Reblozyl (n=224) or placebo (n=112). Reblozyl was administered subcutaneously once every 3 weeks as long as a reduction in transfusion requirement was observed or until unacceptable toxicity. All patients were eligible to receive best supportive care, which included RBC transfusions; iron-chelating agents; use of antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal therapy; and/or nutritional support, as needed. The BELIEVE trial showed a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of erythroid response, defined as at least a 33 percent cut from baseline in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion burden with a reduction of at least two units during a defined period of 12 consecutive weeks, from weeks 13 to 24, compared to placebo. The drug also met all key secondary endpoints of statistically significant improvements in RBC transfusion burden from baseline of at least 33 percent decrease during the weeks 37 to 48 period, and at least a 50 percent reduction from week 13 to week 24, at least a 50 percent decrease from weeks 37 to 48, and a mean change in transfusion burden from weeks 13 to 24.

RANK Ligand is the protein responsible for activating osteoclasts, the cells that break down bone. An increased amount of the protein has been linked as the primary cause of a broad range of bone loss conditions including osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, bone erosions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and bone metastases.
Prolia is specifically indicated for the following patients at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture:
â€¢ Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.
â€¢ To increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.
â€¢ Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women at high risk of fracture who are either initiating or continuing systemic glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5mg or greater of prednisone and expected to remain on glucocorticoids for at least 6months.
â€¢ To increase bone mass in men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer.
â€¢ To increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer.
Prolia is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous administration. The recommended initial dose is 60 mg administered as a single subcutaneous injection once every 6 months. Prolia should be administered via subcutaneous injection in the upper arm, the upper thigh, or the abdomen.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Prolia for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was based on a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial enrolled 7,808 women aged 60 to 91 years with a baseline BMD T-score between -2.5 and -4.0 at either the lumbar spine or total hip. Women with other diseases or on therapy that affect bone were excluded. The women were randomized to receive SC injections of either placebo or Prolia 60 mg once every 6 months. All women received at least 1000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of new morphometric (radiologically-diagnosed) vertebral fractures at 3 years. Prolia significantly reduced the incidence of new morphometric vertebral fractures at 1, 2, and 3 years. The incidence of new vertebral fractures at year 3 was 7.2% in the placebo-treated women compared to 2.3% for the Prolia-treated women.
The FDA approval of Prolia to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis was based on a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled men (n=242) had a baseline BMD T-score between -2.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck. Men with a BMD T-score between -1.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck were also enrolled if there was a history of prior fragility fracture. The subjects were randomized to receive SC injections of either placebo (n=121) or Prolia 60mg (n =121) once every 6 months. All men received at least 1000mg calcium and at least 800IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine Bone Mineral Density (BMD) from baseline to 1-year. The treatment differences in BMD at 1-year were 4.8% (+0.9% placebo, +5.7% Prolia; at the lumbar spine, 2.0% (+0.3% placebo, +2.4% Prolia) at the total hip, and 2.2% (0.0% placebo, +2.1% Prolia) at femoral neck.
The FDA approval of Prolia in the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was based on the 12-month primary analysis of a 2-year, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled study of 795 patients (70% women and 30% men) aged 20 to 94 years (mean age of 63 years) treated with greater than or equal to 7.5mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent) for < 3 months prior to study enrollment and planning to continue treatment for a total of at least 6 months (glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation; n = 290) or â‰¥ 3 months prior to study enrollment and planning to continue treatment for a total of at least 6 months (glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation, n = 505). Enrolled patients <50 years of age were required to have a history of osteoporotic fracture. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either an oral daily bisphosphonate (active-control, risedronate 5mg once daily) (n = 397) or Prolia 60mg subcutaneously once every 6 months (n = 398) for one year. Patients received at least 1000mg calcium and 800IU vitamin D supplementation daily. In the glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation, Prolia significantly increased lumbar spine BMD compared to the active-control at one year (Active-control 0.8%, Prolia 3.8%) with a treatment difference of 2.9%. In the glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation, Prolia significantly increased lumbar spine BMD compared to active-control at one year (Active-control 2.3%, Prolia 4.4%) with a treatment difference of 2.2%.
The FDA approval of Prolia in the treatment of bone loss in men with non-metastatic prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was based on a 3-year, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national study conducted in 1,468 men. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -0.4, and 22% of men had a vertebral fracture at baseline. Men were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (n=734) or Prolia 60mg (n=734) once every 6 months for a total of 6 doses. Randomization was stratified by age (<70 years vs. â‰¥70 years) and duration of ADT at trial entry (â‰¤6 months vs. >6 months). Seventy-nine percent of patients received ADT for more than 6months at study entry. All men received at least 1000mg calcium and 400IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to month 24. Lumbar spine BMD was higher at 2 years in Prolia-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients [-1.0% placebo, +5.6% Prolia; treatment difference 6.7%].
The FDA approval of Prolia for the treatment of bone loss in women receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy for breast cancer was based on a 2-year, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study. Women (n=252) had baseline BMD T-scores between -1.0 to-2.5 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck, and had not experienced fracture after age 25. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -1.1,and 2.0% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline. Women were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (n=125) or Prolia 60mg (n=127) once every 6 months for a total of 4 doses. Randomization was stratified by duration of adjuvant AI therapy at trial entry (â‰¤6months vs. >6months). Sixty-two percent of patients received adjuvant AI therapy for more than 6 months at study entry. All women received at least 1000mg calcium and 400IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to month 12. Lumbar spine BMD was higher at 12 months in Prolia-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients [-0.7% placebo, +4.8% Prolia; treatment difference 5.5%].

Prolia (denosumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to RANKL, a transmembrane or soluble protein essential for the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. Prolia prevents RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone.

Bone Diseases,Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa),"General Information
Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa) is a hydrolytic lysosomal glucocerebroside-specific enzyme that functions as a long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT).
Elelyso is specifically indicated for the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher disease in adults.
Elelyso is supplied as an infusion designed for intravenous administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 60 units/kg administered every other week for 60-120 minutes. Dosage adjustments may be made based on achievement and maintenance of particular therapeutic goals.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA Approval of Elelyso was based on the results of two 9 month multi-center trials.
Trial One
This double-blind, randomized study enrolled 31 adults with Gaucher disease-related enlarged spleens and thrombocytopenia who were ERT-naÃ¯ve. Sixteen subjects had enlarged livers and 10 had anemia at baseline. Subjects were randomized to be treated with Elelyso doses of either 30 units/kg (n=15) or 60 units/kg (n=16). The primary endpoint of change in spleen volume (SD) was observed in MRI at nine months measured by mean % body weight (%BW) and multiples of normal (MN) spleen volumes. Liver volumes and hemoglobin concentrations were also monitored. Subjects in the 30 units/kg and treatment arm demonstrated changes of -0.9 (0.4) %BW mean (SD) and -4.5 (2.1) MN mean (SD). Subjects treated with 60 units/kg demonstrated changes of -1.3 (1.1) %BW mean (SD) and -6.6 (5.4) MN mean (SD).
Trial Two
This open-label single arm study enrolled 25 subjects with Type 1 Gaucher disease who were switched to Elelyso from a 2-year minimum treatment duration of imiglucerase. Subjects were clinically stable and were administrered a stable biweekly dose of imiglucerase for at least 6 months prior to enrollment. Elelyso was administered at the same dosage level as the previous imiglucerase treatment, 11 units/kg to 60 units/kg biweekly. Organ volumes and hemotologic values remained stable on average during the 9 month treatment period.
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions associated with the use of Elelyso may include, but are not limited to, the following:
infusion reactions
URTI/nasopharyngitis
pharyngitis/throat infection
headache arthralgia
influenza/flu
UTI/pyelonephritis

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding the use of Elelyso or Gaucher disease, please visit the Elelyso web page.","Mechanism of Action
Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa) is a recombinant form of human Glucocerebrosidase (GCD). It is a lysosomal glucocerebroside-specific enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide. Subjects with Gaucher disease do not produce enough GCD, which leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow.

Bone Diseases,Strensiq (asfotase alfa),"General Information
Strensiq (asfotase alfa) is a tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase.
Strensiq is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with perinatal/infantile- and juvenile-onset hypophosphatasia.
Strensiq is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous administration. The recommended dosing is as follows:
Perinatal/Infantile-Onset HPP
Recommended dosage regimen is 2 mg/kg administered subcutaneously three times per week, or 1 mg/kg administered six times per week. Injection site reactions may limit the tolerability of the six times per week regimen. The dose may be increased to 3 mg/kg three times per week for insufficient efficacy.
Juvenile-Onset HPP
Recommended dosage regimen is 2 mg/kg administered subcutaneously three times per week, or 1 mg/kg administered six times per week. Injection site reactions may limit the tolerability of the six times per week regimen.
Preparation and Weight-Based Dosing
Caution: Do not use the 80 mg/0.8 mL vial in pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg because the systemic asfotase alfa exposure achieved with the 80 mg/0.8 mL vial (higher concentration) is lower than that achieved with the other strength vials (lower concentration). A lower exposure may not be adequate for this subgroup of patients. â€¢ See full prescribing information for tables of weight-based dosing by treatment regimen.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Strensiq was based on four prospective, open-label studies in 99 patients with perinatal, infantile- or juvenile-onset HPP who received treatment for up to 6.5 years during Study results showed that patients with perinatal- and infantile-onset HPP treated with Strensiq had improved overall survival and survival without the need for a ventilator (ventilator-free survival). Ninety-seven percent of treated patients were alive at one year of age compared to 42 percent of control patients selected from a natural history study group. Similarly, the ventilator-free survival rate at one year of age was 85 percent for treated patients compared to less than 50 percent for the natural history control patients. Patients with juvenile-onset HPP treated with Strensiq showed improvements in growth and bone health compared to control patients selected from a natural history database. All treated patients had improvement in low weight or short stature or maintained normal height and weight. In comparison, approximately 20 percent of control patients had growth delays over time, with shifts in height or weight from the normal range for children their age to heights and weights well below normal for age. Juvenile-onset patients also showed improvements in bone mineralization, as measured on a scale that evaluates the severity of rickets and other HPP-related skeletal abnormalities based on x-ray images. All treated patients demonstrated substantial healing of rickets on x-rays while some natural history control patients showed increasing signs of rickets over time.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Strensiq may include, but are not limited to, the following:
injection site reactions
lipodystrophy
ectopic calcifications
hypersensitivity reactions
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Strensiq or hypophosphatasia, please visit http://strensiq.com/","Mechanism of Action
Hypophosphatasia is caused by a deficiency in the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) enzyme, which leads to elevations in several TNSALP substrates, including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). Elevated extracellular levels of PPi block hydroxyapatite crystal growth which inhibits bone mineralization and causes an accumulation of unmineralized bone matrix which manifests as rickets and bone deformation in infants and children and as osteomalacia (softening of bones) once growth plates close, along with muscle weakness. Replacement of the TNSALP enzyme upon Strensiq treatment reduces the enzyme substrate levels.

Bone Metastases,Aredia (pamidronate disodium for injection),"General Information
Aredia has been approved for treatment of osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy. Aredia is the first drug that has been proven to reduce the incidence of skeletal complications of metastatic breast cancer, thereby reducing the need for radiation therapy or surgery to the bone. It has also been shown to provide relief of bone pain caused by metastatic breast cancer, thereby reducing the need for narcotic analgesics. The drug is also indicated for the treatment of osteolytic bone lesions of multiple myeloma, moderate-to-severe hypercalcemia of malignancy, and moderate-to-severe Paget's disease.
Clinical Results
The marketing clearance was based upon data from two large, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies in breast cancer subjects with osteolytic bone metastases. These studies enrolled 372 subjects treated with hormonal therapy and 382 subjects treated with chemotherapy. All subjects enrolled had stage IV breast cancer with two or more lytic lesions, with at least one lesion that was one centimeter or greater in diameter. Subjects were randomized to receive Aredia 90 mg every three to four weeks via two-hour IV infusions for 12 months or matching placebo, in conjunction with either hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. The studies demonstrated that patients receiving Aredia had a significant reduction in skeletal complications, the primary endpoint, and significant relief of bone pain, a secondary endpoint. The Aredia treatment effect appeared to be less pronounced in the study of those receiving chemotherapy. Additionally, subjects receiving Aredia had fewer pathologic fractures and a decreased need for radiation therapy for pain or skeletal complications.
In these studies, skeletal morbidity was defined as the mean number of skeletal complications (pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, radiation therapy, or surgery to bone) per subject per year. In subjects receiving concomitant chemotherapy, Aredia provided a 36% reduction in the skeletal morbidity rate (2.1 vs. 3.3 with placebo). In subjects receiving concomitant hormonal therapy, skeletal morbidity was reduced by 31% with Aredia (2.4 vs. 3.5). For an average subject, these reductions mean one fewer major skeletal complication per year with Aredia.
Additional results of the trials show that subjects treated with Aredia had fewer skeletal complications than those subjects who received placebo. Also, fewer Aredia-treated subjects required radiation therapy for pain, or to prevent or treat fractures, compared to subjects treated with placebo. Among subjects who had pain at the beginning of the trials, Ardia-treated subjects had less severe pain, and experienced pain less often, in comparison to subjects who did not receive Aredia. Additionally, Aredia-treated subjects also had a decreased need for strong pain medication, unlike subjects receiving placebo. The statistical significance of these results may be overstated due to numerous analyses.
","Side Effects
The incidence and type of adverse events with Aredia were similar to those with placebo, with most events likely due to the underlying disease or concomitant antineoplastic therapy. The most frequent adverse events were fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, anemia, and skeletal pain. Transient arthralgias and myalgias were reported slightly more frequently with Aredia than with antineoplastic therapy alone (12% and 23% vs. 8% and 17%, respectively). Serum calcium and electrolytes must be closely monitored, as must subjects with preexisting anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia.
","Additional Information
Breast cancer is diagnosed in approximately 184,000 women each year, and has the highest incidence of associated metastatic bone disease among all cancers. Approximately 100,000 breast cancer subjects are currently living with cancer that has metastasized to the bone. Subjects with osteolytic bone metastases often suffer from skeletal complications including pathologic bone fractures, spinal cord compression, impaired mobility, and chronic and debilitating bone pain.",
Bone Metastases,Xgeva (denosumab),"General Information
Xgeva (denosumab) is a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds to human RANKL, a transmembrane (soluble protein) essential for the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. Xgeva prevents RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. Increased osteoclast activity, stimulated by RANKL, is a mediator of bone pathology in solid tumors with osseous metastases.
Xgeva is specifically indicated for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.
Xgeva is supplied as a solution designed to subcutaneous administration. The recommended dose of Xgeva is 120 mg administered as a subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks in the upper arm, upper thigh, or abdomen.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xgeva was based on three international, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority trials comparing Xgeva with zoledronic acid. The subjects were randomized to receive 120 mg Xgeva subcutaneously every 4 weeks or 4 mg zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks. The main outcome measure was demonstration of non-inferiority of time to first skeletal-related event (SRE) as compared to zoledronic acid. An SRE was defined as any of the following: pathologic fracture, radiation therapy to bone, surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression.
Trial One
This trial enrolled 2,046 patients with advanced breast cancer and bone metastasis. Randomization was stratified by a history of prior SRE, receipt of chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization, prior oral bisphosphonate use and region. The median number of doses administered was 18 for denosumab and 17 for zoledronic acid.
Trial Two
This trial enrolled 1,776 adults with solid tumors other than breast and castrate-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastasis and multiple myeloma. Randomization was stratified by previous SRE, systemic anticancer therapy at time of randomization and tumor type (non-small cell lung cancer, myeloma, or other). The median number of doses administered was 7 for both denosumab and zoledronic acid.
Trial Three
This trial enrolled 1,901 men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastasis. Randomization was stratified by previous SRE, PSA level (less than 10 ng/mL or 10 ng/mL or greater) and receipt of chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization. The median number of doses administered was 13 for denosumab and 11 for zoledronic acid.
Pooled Data
Xgeva delayed the time to first SRE following randomization as compared to zoledronic acid in patients with breast or castrate-resistant prostate cancer with osseous metastases. In patients with bone metastasis due to other solid tumors or lytic lesions due to multiple myeloma, Xgeva was noninferior to zoledronic acid in delaying the time to first SRE following randomization.

Bone Metastases,Zometa (zoledronic acid),"General Information
Zometa has been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and for patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. For prostate cancer, which is included in this approval, patients should have progressed after treatment with at least one hormonal therapy. The drug is indicated for use in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy.
Zometa is a bisphosphonate that works by inhibiting the breakdown of bone (resorption). The drug was originally approved in August 2001 for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy, a common life-threatening metabolic complication associated with cancer.
Clinical Results
The safety and effectiveness of Zometa was supported by three large international trials that included more than 3,000 subjects with multiple myeloma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer and other solid tumors. The three trials consisted of a pamidronate-controlled trial in breast cancer and multiple myeloma, a placebo-controlled trial in prostate cancer, and a placebo-controlled trial in other solid tumors. Results demonstrated that Zometa decreased skeletal complications of subjects with multiple myeloma or metastases from solid tumors. In the two placebo-controlled trials, the number of subjects with skeletal events and the time to first skeletal-related event were both decreased compared to placebo.
","Side Effects
Zometa, like other bisphosphonates, has been associated with renal insufficiency.
Adverse events reported in clinical trials with Zometa include (but are not limited to) the following:

Additionally, a wide variety of cancer information can be obtained through the National Cancer Institute.","Mechanism of Action
The principal pharmacologic action of zoledronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption. Although the antiresorptive mechanism is not completely understood, several factors are thought to contribute to this action. In vitro, zoledronic acid inhibits osteoclastic activity and induces osteoclast apoptosis. Zoledronic acid also blocks the osteoclastic resorption of mineralized bone and cartilage through its binding to bone. Zoledronic acid inhibits the increased osteoclastic activity and skeletal calcium release induced by various stimulatory factors released by tumors. (from Zometa Prescribing Information)

Xgeva (denosumab) binds to RANKL, a transmembrane or soluble protein essential for the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. Increased osteoclast activity, stimulated by RANKL, is a mediator of bone pathology in solid tumors with osseous metastases. Similarly, giant cell tumors of bone consist of stromal cells expressing RANKL and osteoclast-like giant cells expressing RANK receptor, and signaling through the RANK receptor contributes to osteolysis and tumor growth. Xgeva prevents RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts, their precursors, and osteoclast-like giant cells.

Bowel Dysfunction,Gattex (teduglutide),"General Information
Gattex (teduglutide) is an analog of naturally occurring human glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), a peptide secreted primarily in the distal intestine and involved in the regeneration and repair of the intestinal epithelium. GLP-2 is known to increase intestinal and portal blood flow, and inhibit gastric acid secretion.
Gattex is specifically indicated for the treatment of adults with Short Bowel Syndrome who are dependent on parenteral support. Gattex was subsequently approved for pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) who need additional nutrition or fluids from intravenous (IV) feeding (parenteral support).
Gattex is supplied as a powder for reconstitution into a solution designed for subcutaneous injection. The recommended daily dose is 0.05 mg/kg body weight administered by subcutaneous injection once daily. Alternation of sites for subcutaneous injection is recommended.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Gattex was based on four studies: Study 1 (Placebo-controlled) and Study 2 (Open-label extension of Study 1) and Study 3 (Placebo-controlled) and Study 4 (Blinded uncontrolled extension of Study 3).
Study 1 and Study 2
Study 1
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-national, multi-center clinical trial enrolled adults with SBS who were dependent on parenteral nutrition/intravenous (PN/I.V.) support for at least 12 months and required PN at least 3 times per week. For 8 weeks (or less) prior to randomization, investigators optimized the PN/I.V. volume of all subjects. Optimization was followed by a 4-week to 8-week period of fluid stabilization. Subjects then were randomized to placebo (n=43) or Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day (n=43). Study treatment was administered subcutaneously once daily for 24 weeks. PN/I.V. volume adjustments (up to 30% decrease) and clinical assessments were made at 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, and 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was based on a clinical response, defined as a subject achieving at least 20% reduction in weekly PN/I.V. volume from baseline to both Weeks 20 and 24. Treatment response was reached by 63% of Gattex-treated subjects versus 30% of placebo-treated subjects (p=0.002). At Week 24, the mean reduction in weekly PN/I.V. volume was 4.4 Liters for Gattex-treated subjects (from pre-treatment baseline of 12.9 Liters) versus 2.3 Liters for placebo-treated subjects (from pre-treatment baseline of 13.2 Liters/week) (p<0.001). Twenty-one subjects on Gattex (53.8%) versus 9 on placebo (23.1%) achieved at least a one-day reduction in PN/I.V. support.
Study 2
This ongoing two-year open-label extension of Study 1 has treated 88 subjects who receive Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day. Of responders in Study 1 who entered Study 2, 100% sustained their response to Gattex after one year of continuous treatment. A 20% or greater reduction of parenteral support was achieved in 72% of subjects after an additional 28 weeks of continuous Gattex treatment. The mean reduction of weekly PN/I.V. volume was 5.2 L/week after one year of continuous Gattex treatment. Six subjects in Study 2 were weaned off their PN/I.V. support while on Gattex.
Study 3 and 4
Study 3
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three parallel-group, multinational study enrolled adults with Short Bowel Syndrome who were dependent on parenteral nutrition/intravenous (PN/I.V.) support for at least 12 months and required PN at least 3 times per week. After a period of optimization and stabilization similar to Study 1, subjects were randomized to receive 24 weeks of one of the following treatment regimens: Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day (n=35), Gattex 0.10 mg/kg/day dose (n=33), or placebo (n=16). The primary efficacy endpoint was a graded categorical score that did not achieve statistical significance for the high dose. Evaluation of PN/I.V. volume reduction using the endpoint of response (defined as at least 20% reduction in PN/I.V. fluid from Baseline to Weeks 20 and 24) showed that 46% of subjects on Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day responded versus 6% on placebo. Subjects on Gattex at both dose levels experienced a 2.5 L/week reduction in parenteral support requirements versus 0.9 L/week for placebo at 24 weeks. Two subjects in the Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group were weaned off parenteral support by Week 24.
Study 4
This blinded, uncontrolled extension of Study 3, enrolled 65 subjects from Study 3 who received Gattex for up to an additional 28 weeks of treatment. Of responders in Study 3 who entered Study 4, 75% sustained response on Gattex after one year of treatment. In the Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group, a 20% or greater reduction of parenteral support was achieved in 68% (17/25) of subjects. The mean reduction of weekly PN/I.V. volume was 4.9 L/week (52% reduction from baseline) after one year of continuous Gattex treatment. The subjects who had been completely weaned off PN/I.V. support in Study 3 remained off parenteral support through Study 4. During Study 4, an additional subject from Study 3 was weaned off parenteral support.
FDA Approval in Pediatrics:
In a 24-week pediatric study 59 pediatric patients with SBS aged 1 year through 17 years chose whether to receive Gattex or standard of care (SOC). Patients who chose to receive Gattex treatment were subsequently randomized in a double-blind manner to 0.025 mg/kg/day (n=24) or 0.05 mg/kg/day (n=26), while 9 patients enrolled in the SOC arm. The recommended dosage of Gattex is 0.05 mg/kg/day. Randomization to the Gattex dose groups was stratified by age. At the end of the 24-week study, 69% of patients (18/26) who took Gattex 0.05 mg/kg each day reduced PS volume by 20% or more. Based on patient-diary data, patients who received Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day experienced a 42% mean reduction in PS volume (mL/kg/day) from baseline (-23 mL/kg/day from baseline). At week 24, 38% of patients (10/26) were able to reduce PS infusion by at least 1 day per week. Patients reduced their PS infusion time by 3 hours per day on average compared to baseline. In addition, during this study 3 out of 26 (12%) children who received Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day completely weaned off PS.

Brain Cancer,Avastin (bevacizumab),"General Information
Avastin is a vascular endothelial growth factor directed antibody.
Avastin is specifically indicated for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma in adults.
Avastin is supplied as an injection for intravenous administration. The recommended dose is 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Avastin for glioblastoma was based on a multicenter, randomized, open-label study in patients with recurrent GBM. Patients with first progression following radiotherapy and temozolomide were randomized (2:1) to receive Avastin (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with lomustine (90 mg/m2 every 6 weeks) or lomustine (110 mg/m2 every 6 weeks) alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by World Health Organization performance status (0 vs. >0), steroid use (yes vs. no), largest tumor diameter (â‰¤ 40 vs. > 40 mm), and institution. The main outcome measure was OS. A total of 432 patients were randomized to receive lomustine alone (N=149) or Avastin with lomustine (N=283). No difference in OS was observed between arms; therefore, all secondary outcome measures are descriptive only. PFS was longer in the Avastin with lomustine arm with a median PFS of 4.2 months in the Avastin with lomustine arm and 1.5 months in the lomustine arm. Among the 50% of patients receiving corticosteroids at the time of randomization, a higher percentage of patients in the Avastin with lomustine arm discontinued corticosteroids (23% vs. 12%).
One single arm single center study and a randomized noncomparative multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Avastin 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in patients with previously treated GBM. Response rates in both studies were evaluated based on modified WHO criteria that considered corticosteroid use. In study AVF3708g, the response rate was 25.9% with a median duration of response of 4.2 months. In Study NCI 06-C-0064E, the response rate was 19.6% with a median duration of response of 3.9 months.

Brain Cancer,Gliadel Wafer (polifeprosan 20 with carmustine implant),"General Information
Gliadel Wafer has been approved as the first brain cancer treatment to deliver chemotherapy directly to the tumor site. The product was cleared by the FDA for use as an adjunct to surgery to prolong survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) for whom surgical resection is indicated.
Gliadel Wafer, a new approach to the treatment of recurrent GBM, is a biodegradable wafer implanted at the time of surgery that delivers chemotherapy directly to the tumor site minimizing drug exposure to other areas of the body. Gliadel Wafer complements other standard therapies for brain cancer, such as surgery, radiation and traditional intravenous chemotherapy.
Clinical Results
In September 1996, Gliadel Wafer was cleared for marketing based on data from a landmark study involving 222 patients undergoing surgery for recurrent malignant glioma. Results from this Phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study showed that Gliadel Wafer increased survival at six months by more than 50 percent (from 36% with placebo to 56% with Gliadel Wafer) in patients with GBM.
","Side Effects
The spectrum of adverse events observed in patients who received Gliadel Wafer was consistent with that encountered in patients undergoing surgery for malignant gliomas. The incidence of seizures was the same in the placebo and Gliadel Wafer groups, however, patients receiving Gliadel had an earlier onset of seizures. In Phase III studies, side effects that were more common with Gliadel Wafer versus placebo included pain and healing abnormalities. Other side effects that were more common than seen with placebo, but not statistically significant, were brain edema and local infections.
","Additional Information
GBM is one of the most rapidly progressive and universally fatal of all cancers. There are approximately 20,000 primary brain tumors diagnosed in the United States each year and GBM is the most common type.",
Breast Cancer,Afinitor (everolimus),"General Information
Afinitor is an inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers. Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation and inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies.
Afinitor is specifically indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib.
Afinitor is supplied as a 5 mg or 10 mg tablet designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 10 mg, to be taken once daily at the same time every day, either with or without food. Afinitor tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water; they should not be chewed or crushed.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Afinitor was based on the results of a clinical trial. This international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study enrolled 416 subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with sunitinib, sorafenib, or both sequentially. The subjects received Afinitor 10 mg once daily or placebo, both in conjunction with best cupportive care. After documented radiological progression, subjects could be unblinded by the investigator: those randomized to placebo were then able to receive open-label Afinitor 10 mg daily. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), documented using RECIST criteria. The median progression-free survival was 4.9 months for Afinitor versus 1.9 months for placebo (p<0.0001).

Arimidex has been approved as a treatment for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following therapy with tamoxifen.
Clinical Results
The FDA made its decision after evaluating results of clinical studies involving more than 750 subjects. Results from the two studies showed that Arimidex is effective in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.
","Side Effects
Most commonly reported side effects, regardless of causality, included fatigue, nausea, headache, hot flashes, pain and back pain. Arimidex is not associated with significant weight gain reported with progestins.
","Additional Information
Approximately one woman in eight will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 184,300 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996. It is estimated that about 6% of patients with breast cancer in the United States. have advanced breast cancer.
Please Visit Inspire's Community Pages for this drug.","Mechanism of Action
Results from studies suggest that growth of some breast cancer tumors is stimulated by the female hormone estrogen. Arimidex, a nonsteroidal compound, is the first entry in a new class of third-generation selective oral aromatase inhibitors. Inhibition of aromatase reduces the production of estrogen. Thus, Arimidex reduces serum concentration of estrogen, an effect that has been shown to be of benefit in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.
"
Breast Cancer,Aromasin Tablets,"General Information
Aromasin, a new drug to treat post-menopausal advanced breast cancer in patients for whom treatment with tamofixen was ineffective, has been shown to inhibit the production of estrogen, upon which some breast cancer cells depend. Furthermore, studies indicate that Aromasin, which reduces the risk of tumor progression by 18 percent and the risk of death by 23 percent, is more beneficial than the hormone therapy, megestrol acetate.
In post-menopausal women, the principle source of estrogen comes from the conversion of adrenal and ovarian androgens to estrogens by the aromatase (exemestane) enzyme. For post-menopausal women with hormone-dependent breast cancer, Aromasin serves as an aromatase inhibitor. As a result, the concentrations of estrogen, on which breast cancer cells may depend, are lowered. This estrogen-depriving process nicknamed, ""suicide inhibition,"" is irreversible. However, it does not affect other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway up to a concentration at least 600 times higher than that inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.
Warnings/Precautions:
Aromasin should not be administered to premenopausal women. Neither should it be coadministered with estrogen-containing agents.
Pregnant women should not take Aromasin, as it could pose a potential hazard to the fetus, and could cause potential loss of the pregnancy.
Aromasin has not yet been tested for pediatric patients.
Clinical Results
A phase III, double blind, randomized study was conducted for 769 post-menopausal patients whose breast cancer had metastasized (spread). The study compared the effects of Aromasin versus those of megestrol acetate on survival, tumor reduction, and duration of disease stabilization. Patients taking megestrol acetate had a median survival (estimated time at which 50 percent of the patients were still alive) of approximately 28 months, while patients taking Aromasin had a median survival significantly longer than 28 months (p< 0.039). Moreover, the progression of cancer was delayed longer in patients taking Aromasin (4.7 months) than in patients taking megestrol acetate (3.8 months). Also, 15 percent of patients treated with Aromasin experienced at least a 50 percent or greater reduction in the size of the tumor or a complete disappearance of all known lesions. This suggested a possible advantage over the 12.4 percent of patients treated with megestrol acetate who experienced this effect, although the difference was not statistically significant. Finally, the regiment for taking Aromasin is one 25mg pill taken daily, versus the 40mg pill of megestrol acetate taken four times daily. Based on the study's results, researchers are confident that Aromasin provides greater benefit than megestrol acetate.
","Side Effects
In clinical trials, any adverse effects were generally described as mild to moderate. Some Aromasin use was associated with low-grade nausea, hot-flashes, fatigue, increased sweating, and increased appetite. However, only 7.6% of patients experienced undesirable weight gain (lower than the rate caused by magestrol acetate).
Warnings/Precautions
Aromasin should not be administered to premenopausal women. Neither should it be coadministered with estrogen-containing agents. Pregnant women should not take Aromasin, as it could pose a potential hazard to the fetus, and could cause potential loss of the pregnancy.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Exemestane is an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator, structurally related to the natural substrate androstenedione. It acts as a false substrate for the aromatase enzyme and is processed to an intermediate that binds irreversibly to the active site of the enzyme causing its inactivation. Exemestane significantly lowers circulating estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women, but has no detectable effect on adrenal biosynthesis of corticosteroids or aldosterone. (FDA Label)"
Breast Cancer,Ellence,"General Information
ELLENCE Injection (epirubicin hydrochloride injection) is an anthracycline cytotoxic agent intended for intravenous administration. ELLENCE is supplied as a sterile, clear, red solution and is available in polypropylene vials containing 50 and 200 mg of epirubicin hydrochloride as a preservative-free, ready-to-use solution. Each milliliter of solution contains 2 mg of epirubicin hydrochloride. Inactive ingredients include sodium chloride, USP, and water for injection, USP. The pH of the solution has been adjusted to 3.0 with hydrochloric acid, NF. Epirubicin hydrochloride is the 4â€™-epimer of doxorubicin and is a semi-synthetic derivative of daunorubicin. The chemical name is (8S-cis)-10-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-a-L-arabino- hexopyranosyl)oxy]-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,8,11-trihydroxy-8-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-methoxy-5,12- naphthacenedione hydrochloride. The active ingredient is a red-orange hygroscopic powder, with the empirical formula C27H29NO11HCl and a molecular weight of 579.95.
Clinical Results
Two randomized, open-label, multicenter studies evaluated the use of ELLENCE Injection 100 to 120 mg/m 2 in combination with cyclophosphamide and fluorouracil for the adjuvant treatment of patients with axillary-node-positive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastatic disease (Stage II or III). Study MA-5 evaluated 120 mg/m 2 of epirubicin per course in combination with cyclophosphamide and fluorouracil (CEF-120 regimen). This study randomized premenopausal and perimenopausal women with one or more positive lymph nodes to an epirubicin-containing CEF- 120 regimen or to a CMF regimen. Study GFEA-05 evaluated the use of 100 mg/m 2 of epirubicin per course in combination with fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide (FEC-100). This study randomized pre- and postmenopausal women to the FEC-100 regimen or to a lower-dose FEC-50 regimen. In the GFEA-05 study, eligible patients were either required to have > 4 nodes involved with tumor or, if only 1 to 3 nodes were positive, to have negative estrogen- and progesterone-receptors and a histologic tumor grade of 2 or 3. A total of 1281 women participated in these studies. Patients with T4 tumors were not eligible for either study.
","Side Effects
Hematologic toxicity, cardiotoxicity can result. Patients should be informed of the expected adverse effects of epirubicin, including gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomatitis) and potential neutropenic complications.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Intravenously administered solution. Epirubicin is an anthracycline cytotoxic agent. Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicinâ€™s cytotoxic and/or antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated. Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis. Such intercalation triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in cytocidal activity. Epirubicin also inhibits DNA helicase activity, preventing the enzymatic separation of double-stranded DNA and interfering with replication and transcription. Epirubicin is also involved in oxidation/reduction reactions by generating cytotoxic free radicals. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of epirubicin is thought to result from these or other possible mechanisms. Epirubicin is cytotoxic in vitro to a variety of established murine and human cell lines and primary cultures of human tumors. It is also active in vivo against a variety of murine tumors and human xenografts in athymic mice, including breast tumors."
Breast Cancer,Evista (raloxifene hydrochloride),"General Information
Evista (raloxifene hydrochloride) is an estrogen agonist/antagonist, referred to as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and belongs to the benzothiophene class of compounds. The biological actions of raloxifene are largely mediated through binding to estrogen receptors. This binding results in activation of estrogenic pathways in some tissues (agonism) and and the blockade of estrogenic pathways in other tissues (antagonism).
Evista is specifically approved for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, the reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and the reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at high risk of invasive breast cancer. Evista is supplied as a 60 mg tablet designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is one 60 mg tablet daily, which may be administered any time of day without regard to meals.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Evista was based on the results of several clinical trials.
Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Effect on Fracture Incidence
This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational trial enrolled 7,705 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. In the subjects with no baseline fractures, the percentage with one or more than one new vertebral fracture after three years was 1.9% in the Evista arm versus 4.3% in the placebo arm. In the subjects with one or more than one baseline fracture, the percentage of those with one or more than one additional fracture after three years was 14.1% in the Evista arm versus 20.2% in the placebo arm. In all randomized subjects the percentage with one or more than one new clinical (painful) vertebral fracture after three years was 1.8% in the Evista arm versus 3.1% in the placebo arm.
Effect on Bone Mineral Density
All women in this study received Evista (60 mg/day) in addition to calcium (500 mg/day) and vitamin D (400 to 600 IU/day). Treatment with Evista increased spine and hip BMD by 2 to 3%. It also decreased the incidence of the first vertebral fracture from 4.3% for placebo to 1.9% for Evista (relative risk reduction = 55%) and subsequent vertebral fractures from 20.2% for placebo to 14.1% for Evista (relative risk reduction = 30%). The increases in BMD for Lumbar Spine were as follows: 2.0 (12 months) 2.6 (24 months) and 2.6 (36 months); and for Femoral Neck were 1.3 (12 months), 1.9 (24 months) and 2.1 (36 months).
Bone Histology
Bone biopsies for qualitative and quantitative histomorphometry were obtained at baseline and after 2 years of treatment. Of 56 evaluable biopsies, there were statistically significant decreases in bone formation rate per tissue volume, consistent with a reduction in bone turnover. Normal bone quality was maintained, including no evidence of osteomalacia, marrow fibrosis, cellular toxicity, or woven bone.
Effect on Endometrium
Endometrial thickness was evaluated annually in a subset of the study population (1781 subjects) for 3 years. Placebo-treated women had a 0.27 mm mean decrease from baseline in endometrial thickness over 3 years, whereas the Evista-treated women had a 0.06 mm mean increase.
Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Three randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind osteoporosis prevention trials were conducted: a North American trial that enrolled 544 women; a European trial that enrolled 601 women; and an international trial that enrolled 619 women who had undergone hysterectomy. All the subjects received placebo or Evista (60 mg/day) both in combination with calcium supplementation (400 to 600 mg/day).
Effect on Bone Mineral Density
When compared to placebo the increases in BMD for each of the three studies were statistically significant at 12 months and were maintained at 24 months (p=0.001). This included BMD increases in total hip, femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter and lumbar spine. Evista also increased BMD compared with placebo in the total body by 1.3% to 2.0% and in Wardâ€™s Triangle (hip) by 3.1% to 4.0%.
Effect on Endometrium
Endometrial thickness was evaluated from 831 women in all dose groups every 6 months for 24 months. Placebo-treated women had a 0.04 mm mean increase from baseline in endometrial thickness over 2 years, whereas the Evista treated women had a 0.09 mm mean increase.
Reduction in Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis
MORE Trial
This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational trial evaluated the effect of Evista (60 mg/day) on the incidence of breast cancer as a secondary safety endpoint. After four years, Evista reduced the incidence of all breast cancers by 62%, compared with placebo (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.22-0.67). Evista also reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 71%, compared with placebo (ARR 3.1 per 1000 women-years); this was primarily due to an 80% reduction in the incidence of ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the Evista group compared with placebo.
CORE Trial
The effect of Evista on the incidence of invasive breast cancer was evaluated for 4 additional years in a follow-up study conducted in a subset of postmenopausal women originally enrolled in the MORE trial. The women were not re-randomized and thus continued on the 60 mg/day Evista therapy. Evista reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 56%, compared with placebo (ARR 3.0 per 1000 women-years); this was primarily due to a 63% reduction in the incidence of ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the Evista group compared with placebo. There was no reduction in the incidence of ER-negative breast cancer. In a subset of postmenopausal women followed for up to 8 years from randomization in MORE to the end of CORE, Evista (60 mg/day) reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 60% in women assigned Evista compared with placebo (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21, 0.77; ARR 1.95 per 1000 women-years); this was primarily due to a 65% reduction in the incidence of ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the Evista group compared with placebo.
RUTH Trial
This randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, multinational study enrolled 10,101 postmenopausal women at increased risk of coronary events. The women were followed for a median of 5.6 years after treatment. Evista (60 mg/day) reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 44% compared with placebo [absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2 per 1000 women-years]; this was primarily due to a 55% reduction in ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the Evista group compared with placebo (ARR 1.2 per 1000 women-years). There was no reduction in ER-negative invasive breast cancer.
Reduction in Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women at High Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer
STAR Trial
This randomized, double-blind trial enrolled 19,747 postmenopausal women in North America. The trial was designed to compare the effects of Evista (60 mg/day) versus tamoxifen (20 mg/day) over 5 years on reducing the incidence of invasive breast cancer. Evista was not superior to tamoxifen in reducing the incidence of invasive breast cancer. The observed incidence rates of invasive breast cancer were Evista 4.4 and tamoxifen 4.3 per 1000 women per year.
Effects on Cardiovascular Disease
In the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational trial, dubbed RUTH, 10,101 postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events, received Evista 60 mg/day. They were observed for a median follow-up of 5.6 years. No cardiovascular benefit was demonstrated after treatment with Evista and no significant increase or decrease was observed for coronary events. An increased risk of death due to stroke after treatment with Evista was observed: 59 (1.2%) Evista-treated women died due to a stroke compared to 39 (0.8%) placebo-treated women (2.2 versus 1.5 per 1000 women-years; hazard ratio 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.24; p=0.0499).

The biological actions of raloxifene are largely mediated through binding to estrogen receptors. This binding results in activation of estrogenic pathways in some tissues (agonism) and and the blockade of estrogenic pathways in other tissues (antagonism). The agonistic or antagonistic activity of raloxiffene depends on the extent of recruitment of coactivators and corepressors to estrogen receptor (ER) target gene promotors. Raloxifene appears to act as an estrogen agonist in bone. It decreases bone resorption and bone turnover, increases bone mineral density and decreases fracture incidence.

Breast Cancer,Faslodex (fulvestrant),"General Information
AstraZeneca's Faslodex has been approved for the treatment of hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer. It is indicated for use in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed after receiving anti-estrogen therapy (such as tamoxifen). The therapy is given as a once-a-month intramuscular injection.
After breast cancer diagnosis, hormone receptor tests can be conducted to determine whether a patient's cancer is responsive to estrogen (known as estrogen receptor positive). If the cancer is found to be estrogen receptor positive, treatment options include an anti-estrogen therapy such as tamoxifen, which blocks the estrogen receptor. Faslodex may be an effective alternative for patients who are not successfully treated with tamoxifen because of its mechanism of action. Instead of blocking the estrogen receptor, Faslodex targets and degrades the estrogen receptors present in breast cancer cells.
Clinical Results
The effectiveness of Faslodex was demonstrated in clinical trials comparing the drug to the aromatase inhibitor Arimidex (anastrozole), which works by reducing the amount of estrogen in the body. Two randomized trials in North America and Europe were conducted in postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The double-blind North American trial included 400 women, while the open, randomized European trial included 451 women. All subjects had progressed after previous therapy with an anti-estrogen or progestin.
Subjects were randomized to receive either Faslodex 250 mg intramuscularly once a month or Arimidex 1 mg orally once a day. All subjects were assessed monthly for the first three months and then every three months thereafter. Results showed that Faslodex was at least as effective as Arimidex. In the North American trial, objective tumor response rates were 17.0% for both the Faslodex- and Arimidex-treated groups. In the European trial, Faslodex produced a 20.3% objective tumor response rate, compared to 14.9% for the Arimidex group. Time to progression for Faslodex versus Arimidex was 5.5 months versus 3.5 months in the North American trial and 5.5 months versus 5.2 months in the European trial.
","Side Effects
Adverse events reported in clinical testing of Faslodex include (but are not limited to) the following:
Vomiting
Nausea
Constipation
Pain
Headache
Diarrhea
Hot flushes
Pharyngitis (throat inflammation)
","Additional Information

If you would like to learn more about breast cancer, please visit the National Cancer Institute.","Mechanism of Action
Many breast cancers have estrogen receptors (ER), and the growth of these tumors can be stimulated by estrogen. Fulvestrant is an estrogen receptor antagonist that binds to the estrogen receptor in a competitive manner with affinity comparable to that of estradiol. Fulvestrant downregulates the ER protein in human breast cancer cells.
In a clinical study in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer treated with single doses of Faslodex 15-22 days prior to surgery, there was evidence of increasing down regulation of ER with increasing dose. This was associated with a dose-related decrease in the expression of the progesterone receptor, an estrogen-regulated protein. These effects on the ER pathway were also associated with a decrease in Ki67 labeling index, a marker of cell proliferation.
In vitro studies demonstrated that fulvestrant is a reversible inhibitor of the growth of tamoxifen-resistant, as well as estrogen-sensitive human breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines. In in vivo tumor studies, fulvestrant delayed the establishment of tumors from xenografts of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in nude mice. Fulvestrant inhibited the growth of established MCF-7 xenografts and of tamoxifen-resistant breast tumor xenografts. Fulvestrant resistant breast tumor xenografts may also be cross-resistant to tamoxifen.
Fulvestrant showed no agonist-type effects in in vivo uterotropic assays in immature or ovariectomized mice and rats. In in vivo studies in immature rats and ovariectomized monkeys, fulvestrant blocked the uterotrophic action of estradiol. In postmenopausal women, the absence of changes in plasma concentrations of FSH and LH in response to fulvestrant treatment (250 mg monthly) suggests no peripheral steroidal effects.

Breast Cancer,Femara (letrozole),"General Information
Femara has been approved for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive or hormone receptor unknown locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The drug is a once-a-day oral treatment originally approved in 1997 for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy.
Estrogen has been shown to stimulate the growth of certain hormone-dependent cancer cells. In postmenopausal women, estrogen is primarily produced from the conversion of adrenal androgens to estrogen. This conversion is catalyzed by an enzyme known as aromatase. Femara contains 2.5 mg of letrozole, a compound that blocks the action of aromatase and therefore inhibits the conversion of androgens to estrogens.
Advanced breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. Over 120,000 American women have advanced breast cancer, and approximately half of the 182,000 newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer each year are in an advanced stage when detected.
Clinical Results
Among other studies, Femara was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, multinational phase III trial that compared Femara 2.5 mg to tamoxifen 20 mg in 907 postmenopausal women with locally advanced (stage IIIB) disease, metastatic breast cancer, or recurrences not amenable to treatment with surgery or radiotherapy. Results of the trial demonstrated that Femara delayed progression of advanced breast cancer for 9.4 months compared to 6.0 months for tamoxifen. Significant differences were also observed between Femara and tamoxifen in terms of objective response rate (30% vs. 20%), clinical benefit (49% vs. 38%) and time to treatment failure (9.1 months vs. 5.7 months). Femara and tamoxifen were equally well tolerated.
","Side Effects
Reported adverse events for Femara vs. tamoxifen included (but are not limited to) the following:
Bone pain (20% vs. 18%)
Hot flushes (18% vs. 15%)
Back pain (17% vs. 17%)
Nausea (15% vs. 16%)
Dyspnea (abnormal breathing) (14% vs. 15%)

Please Visit Inspire's Community Pages for this drug.","Mechanism of Action
Letrozole is a nonsteroidal competitive inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme system; it inhibits the conversion of androgens to estrogens. In adult non-tumor and tumor-bearing female animals, letrozole is as effective as ovariectomy in reducing uterine weight, elevating serum LH, and causing the regression of estrogen-dependent tumors. In contrast to ovariectomy, treatment with letrozole does not lead to an increase in serum FSH. Letrozole selectively inhibits gonadal steroidogenesis but has no significant effect on adrenal mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid synthesis.
Letrozole inhibits the aromatase enzyme by competitively binding to the heme of the cytochrome P450 subunit of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of estrogen biosynthesis in all tissues. Treatment of women with letrozole significantly lowers serum estrone, estradiol and estrone sulfate and has not been shown to significantly affect adrenal corticosteroid synthesis, aldosterone synthesis, or synthesis of thyroid hormones.

Halaven is supplied as a solution for intravenous injection.
The recommended dose is 1.4 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.
The recommended dose of Halaven in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) is 1.1 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.
The recommended dose of Halaven in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) is 0.7 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.
The recommended dose of Halaven in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/min) is 1.1 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Halaven was based on an open-label, randomized, multicenter trial in 762 patients with metastatic breast cancer who received at least two chemotherapeutic regimens and experienced disease progression within six months of their last chemotherapeutic regimen. The subjects were randomized to receive Halaven (n=508) or a single agent therapy selected prior to randomization (n=254). Randomization was stratified by geographic region, HER2/neu status, and prior capecitabine exposure. Halaven was administered at a dose of 1.4 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Halaven-treated patients received a median of 5 cycles of therapy. Control arm therapy consisted of 97% chemotherapy and 3% hormone therapy. The main efficacy outcome was overall survival. A statistically significant improvement in overall survival was observed n the Halaven arm vs. placebo: of the 508 subjects in the Halaven arm there were 274 deaths and of the 254 subjects in the control arm there were 148 deaths (p=0.041). An updated, unplanned survival analysis was conducted when 77% of events had been observed and was consistent with the primary analysis (386 vs. 203 deaths, respectively).

The FDA approval of Herceptin for adjuvant breast cancer was based on integrated analysis of two randomized, open-label, clinical trials (Studies 1 and 2) with a total of 4,063 women at the protocol-specified final overall survival analysis, a third randomized, open-label, clinical trial (Study 3) with a total of 3,386 women at definitive Disease-Free Survival analysis for one-year Herceptin treatment versus observation, and a fourth randomized, open-label clinical trial with a total of 3,222 patients (Study 4). In the joint analysis the Disease Free Survival rate at 3.5 years was 86.7%.
The FDA approval of Herceptin for metastatic breast cancer was based on a randomized, controlled clinical trial in combination with chemotherapy (Study 5, n = 469 patients) and an open-label, single agent clinical trial (Study 6, n = 222 patients). Both trials studied patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein. Study 5 data: Trial results showed that patients treated with Herceptin and chemotherapy experienced tumor progression later than patients treated with chemotherapy alone. The median time to disease progression was increased by 65 percent (from 4.6 to 7.6 months). Approximately 28 percent of women treated with Herceptin plus chemotherapy did not show evidence of tumor progression at one year compared to 14 percent of the women treated with chemotherapy alone. Study 6 data: The overall response rate assessed by the Response Evaluation Committee (REC) was 16 percent (34 of 213) with eight patients experiencing a complete response (4 percent) and 26 experiencing a partial response (12 percent). The median duration of response was 9 months.

Breast Cancer,Herceptin Hylecta (trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk),"General Information
Herceptin Hylecta is a fixed dose combination of trastuzumab, a HER2/neu receptor antagonist, with Halozyme's proprietary recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme (Enhanze technology), which has been shown to increase the absorption rate of a trastuzumab.
Herceptin Hylecta is specifically indicated for the following:
Adjuvant treatment of adults with HER2 overexpressing node positive or node negative (ER/PR negative or with one high risk feature breast cancer â€¢ as part of a treatment regimen consisting of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and either paclitaxel or docetaxel â€¢ as part of a treatment regimen with docetaxel and carboplatin â€¢ as a single agent following multi-modality anthracycline based therapy.
Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for trastuzumab.
Metastatic Breast Cancer in adults: â€¢ in combination with paclitaxel for first-line treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer â€¢ as a single agent for treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer in patients who have received one or more chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for trastuzumab.
Herceptin Hylecta is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous administration. Prior to administration select patients based on HER2 protein overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in tumor specimens. The recommended dose of Herceptin Hylecta is 600 mg/10,000 units (600 mg trastuzumab and 10,000 units hyaluronidase) administered subcutaneously over approximately 2-5 minutes once every three weeks. No loading dose is required. No dose adjustments for patient body weight or for different concomitant chemotherapy regimens are required.
Duration of treatment: Patients with adjuvant breast cancer should be treated for 52 weeks or until disease recurrence, whichever occurs first; extending treatment in adjuvant breast cancer beyond one year is not recommended. Patients with metastatic breast cancer should be treated until progression of disease.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Herceptin Hylecta for adjuvant breast cancer was based on a comparability study between Herceptin Hylecta administered subcutaneously and intravenous trastuzumab was established in the HannaH study. The HannaH study was conducted in patients with HER2 overexpressing breast cancer in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings with co-primary endpoints of pathological complete response (pCR) and the PK endpoint of Ctrough at cycle 7. The HannaH study was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, clinical trial in 596 patients with HER2-positive operable or locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), including inflammatory breast cancer. HER2 positivity was defined as IHC 3+ or ISH+. Patients were randomized to receive 8 cycles of either Herceptin Hylecta or intravenous trastuzumab concurrently with chemotherapy (docetaxel followed by 5FU, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide), followed by surgery and continued therapy with Herceptin Hylecta or intravenous trastuzumab as treated prior to surgery, for an additional 10 cycles, to complete 18 cycles of therapy. The trial was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of treatment with Herceptin Hylecta versus intravenous trastuzumab based on the co-primary endpoints. The analysis of the efficacy co-primary outcome, pCR, defined as absence of invasive neoplastic cells in the breast, resulted in rates of 45.4% in the Herceptin Hylecta arm and 40.7% in the intravenous trastuzumab arm. The PK endpoint demonstrated non-inferiority.
The FDA approval of Herceptin Hylecta for metastatic breast cancer was based on the SafeHER study, a prospective, two-cohort, non-randomized, multinational, open-label study designed to assess the overall safety and tolerability of Herceptin Hylecta with chemotherapy in 1,864 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients received a fixed dose of 600 mg Herceptin Hylecta every 3 weeks for a total of 18 cycles throughout the study. Herceptin Hylecta treatment was initiated either sequentially with chemotherapy, concurrently with chemotherapy, or without adjuvant chemotherapy, or in combination with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by trastuzumab therapy. In the ITT population (n=1,867), 126 patients (7%) had a DFS event (recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer or death) and 28 patients (1.5%) had an OS event at the time of clinical cut-off.

Herceptin Hylecta is a fixed dose combination of trastuzumab, a HER2/neu receptor antagonist, with Halozyme's proprietary recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme (Enhanze technology). The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2.
Trastuzumab is a mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2.
Hyaluronan is a polysaccharide found in the extracellular matrix of the subcutaneous tissue. It is depolymerized by the naturally occurring enzyme hyaluronidase. Unlike the stable structural components of the interstitial matrix, hyaluronan has a half-life of approximately 0.5 days. Hyaluronidase increases permeability of the subcutaneous tissue by depolymerizing hyaluronan. In the doses administered, hyaluronidase in Herceptin Hylecta acts transiently and locally.
The effects of hyaluronidase are reversible and permeability of the subcutaneous tissue is restored within 24 to 48 hours. Hyaluronidase has been shown to increase the absorption rate of a trastuzumab product into the systemic circulation when given in the subcutis of GÃ¶ttingen Minipigs

Ibrance is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended dose of Ibrance is a 125 mg capsule taken orally once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment to comprise a complete cycle of 28 days. Ibrance should be taken with food in combination with letrozole 2.5 mg once daily given continuously throughout the 28-day cycle. The dose should be taken at approximately the same time each day.
If the patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken that day. The next prescribed dose should be taken at the usual time. Ibrance capsules should be swallowed whole (do not chew, crush or open them prior to swallowing). No capsule should be ingested if it is broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact.
Please see the drug label for recommended dose modifications based on adverse events.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ibrance was based on the following trials:
PALOMA 2: a randomized, open-label, multicenter study of Ibrance plus letrozole versus letrozole alone conducted in 165 postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had not received previous systemic treatment for their advanced disease. Randomization was stratified by disease site (visceral versus bone only versus other) and by disease-free interval (>12 months from the end of adjuvant treatment to disease recurrence versus â‰¤12 months from the end of adjuvant treatment to disease recurrence or de novo advanced disease). Ibrance was given orally at a dose of 125 mg daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment. Subjects received study treatment until progressive disease, unmanageable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. For subjects treated with the combination of Ibrance plus letrozole, the median PFS was 24.8 months compared to the 14.5 months of PFS in subjects who received letrozole alone. Overall response rate in subjects with measurable disease as assessed by the investigator was higher in the Ibrance plus letrozole compared to the letrozole alone arm (55.4% versus 39.4%).
PALOMA-3 was an international, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study of Ibrance plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant conducted in women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, regardless of their menopausal status, whose disease progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy. A total of 521 pre/postmenopausal women were randomized 2:1 to Ibrance plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant and stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, menopausal status at study entry (pre/peri versus postmenopausal), and presence of visceral metastases. Ibrance was given orally at a dose of 125 mg daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment. The median PFS in the Ibrance plus fulvestrant arm was 9.5 months versus 4.6 months in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. The objective response rate was 24.6% versus 10.9% for each arm, respectively.
To obtain FDA approval of Ibrance in males with breast cancer, Pfizer provided the results of an analysis of real-world data (RWD) from electronic health records (EHRs) as additional supportive data to characterize the use of palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) in male patients with breast cancer based on observed tumor responses in this rare subset of patients with breast cancer.

Ibrance (palbociclib) is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6. Cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 are downstream of signaling pathways which lead to cellular proliferation. In vitro, palbociclib reduced cellular proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell lines by blocking progression of the cell from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with the combination of palbociclib and antiestrogens leads to decreased retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation resulting in reduced E2F expression and signaling and increased growth arrest compared to treatment with each drug alone. In vitro treatment of ER-positive breast cancer cell lines with the combination of palbociclib and antiestrogens leads to increased cell senescence, which was sustained for up to 6 days following drug removal. In vivo studies using a patient-derived ER-positive breast cancer xenograft model demonstrated that the combination of palbociclib and letrozole increased the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation, downstream signaling and tumor growth compared to each drug alone.

Breast Cancer,Ixempra (ixabepilone),"General Information
Ixempra (ixabepilone) is a semi-synthetic analog of epothilone B. It binds to tubulin and promotes tubulin polymerization and microtubule stabilization, thereby arresting cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle and inducing tumor cell apoptosis.
Ixempra is specifically indicated in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer resistant to treatment with an anthracycline and a taxane, or whose cancer is taxane resistant and for whom further anthracycline therapy is contraindicated. Ixempra monotherapy is specifically indicated for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer in patients whose tumors are resistant or refractory to anthracyclines, taxanes, and capecitabine.
Ixempra is supplied as as a solution designed for intravenous administration. The recommended initial dose is is 40 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 3 hours every three weeks. Doses for patients with body surface area greater than 2.2 m2 should be calculated based on 2.2 m2.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Ixempra was based on the results of two clinical trials.
Combination Therapy
This open-label trial enrolled 752 subjects whose disease had rapidly progressed through at least two prior therapies (anthracycline and taxane). Subjects were randomized to receive ixabepilone (40 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) in combination with capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1 week rest) or capecitabine alone. The combination treatment prolonged progression free survival compared to capecitabine alone (5.7 months vs. 4.1 months), with a statistically significant 25% decrease in the risk of disease progression. An objective response rate was observed in more than twice as many subjects in the combination group compared to control (34.7% vs. 14.3%). The median duration of response was 6.4 months versus 5.6 months.
Monotherapy
This single-arm trial enrolled 126 women who had heavily pretreated, advanced metastatic breast cancer, which had progressed through following two or more chemotherapy regimens including an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine. Ixempra was administered at a dose of 40 mg/m2 intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks, for a median of 4 cycles. The primary endpoint was objective response rate.

Breast Cancer,Kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab emtansine),"General Information
Kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) is a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate. Upon binding to the HER2 receptor, ado-trastuzumab emtansine results in intracellular release of DM1-containing cytotoxic catabolites. Binding of DM1 to tubulin disrupts microtubule networks in the cell, which results in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death.
Kadcyla is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination. Kadcyla is also indicated for adjuvant treatment of patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC) who have residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant taxane and Herceptin (trastuzumab)-based treatment.
Kadcyla is supplied as a solution designed for intravenous infusion. The recommended initial dose is 3.6 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (21-day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Do not administer Kadcyla at doses greater than 3.6 mg/kg. First infusion: Administer infusion over 90 minutes. Patients should be observed during the infusion and for at least 90 minutes following the initial dose for fever, chills, or other infusion related reactions. Subsequent infusions: Administer over 30 minutes if prior infusions were well tolerated. Patients should be observed during the infusion and for at least 30 minutes after infusion.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Kadcyla was based on a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial of 991 subjects with HER2-positive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. All subjects had received prior taxane and trastuzumab-based therapy. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive Kadcyla (3.6 mg/kg on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle) or lapatinib (1250 mg/day orally once per day of a 21-day cycle) plus capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 orally twice daily on Days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle). Treatment continued until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. The co-primary efficacy endpoints of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) based on tumor response assessments by an independent review committee and overall survival (OS). The subjects treated with Kadcyla had a median progression-free survival of 9.6 months compared to 6.4 months in patients treated with lapatinib plus capecitabine. The median overall survival was 30.9 months in the Kadcyla group and 25.1 months in the lapatinib plus capecitabine group.
The FDA approval of Kadcyla for adjuvant treatment of patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC) who have residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant taxane and Herceptin (trastuzumab)-based treatment was based on results of the Phase III KATHERINE study. Results showed Kadcyla significantly reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer recurrence or death from any cause (invasive disease-free survival; iDFS) by 50% compared to Herceptin as an adjuvant treatment in patients with HER2-positive EBC who have residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant taxane and Herceptin-based treatment. At three years, 88.3% of patients treated with Kadcyla did not have their breast cancer return compared to 77.0% treated with Herceptin, an absolute improvement of 11.3%.

KIsqali is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose of Kisqali is 600 mg (three 200 mg film-coated tablets) taken orally, once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment resulting in a complete cycle of 28 days. Kisqali can be taken with or without food. Coadminister Kisqali with letrozole 2.5 mg taken once daily throughout the 28-day cycle. Refer to the full prescribing information of letrozole. For dosing and administration with other aromatase inhibitors refer to the applicable full prescribing information. Patients should take their dose of Kisqali and letrozole at approximately the same time each day, preferably in the morning. If the patient vomits after taking the dose, or misses a dose, no additional dose should be taken that day. The next prescribed dose should be taken at the usual time. Kisqali tablets should be swallowed whole (tablets should not be chewed, crushed or split prior to swallowing).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Kisqali was based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international clinical trial (MONALEESA-2), in post-menopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer who received no prior therapy for advanced disease. A total of 668 women were randomized to receive either ribociclib plus letrozole (n=334) or placebo plus letrozole (n=334). Ribociclib 600 mg or placebo was administered orally once daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by 7 days off, with letrozole 2.5 mg administered orally once daily for 28 days. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A pre-planned interim efficacy analysis demonstrated an improvement in PFS (investigator-assessed) (p<0.0001). The estimated median PFS had not been reached in the ribociclib-containing arm and was 14.7 months in the placebo-containing arm. Objective response rate (ORR) in patients with measurable disease was 52.7% in the ribociclib plus letrozole arm and 37.1% in the placebo plus letrozole arm. Overall survival data were immature.

Kisqali (ribociclib) is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6. These kinases are activated upon binding to Dcyclins and play a crucial role in signaling pathways which lead to cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. The cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex regulates cell cycle progression through phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). In vitro, ribociclib decreased pRb phosphorylation leading to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and reduced cell proliferation in breast cancer cell lines. In vivo, treatment with single agent ribociclib in a rat xenograft model with human tumor cells led to decreased tumor volumes, which correlated with inhibition of pRb phosphorylation. In studies using patient-derived estrogen receptor positive breast cancer xenograft models, combination of ribociclib and antiestrogen (e.g. letrozole) resulted in increased tumor growth inhibition compared to each drug alone.

Nerlynx (neratinib) is a kinase inhibitor that irreversibly binds to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), and HER4. In vitro, neratinib reduces EGFR and HER2 autophosphorylation, downstream MAPK and AKT signaling pathways, and showed antitumor activity in EGFR and/or HER2 expressing carcinoma cell lines. Neratinib human metabolites M3, M6, M7 and M11 inhibited the activity of EGFR, HER2 and HER4 in vitro. In vivo, oral administration of neratinib inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenograft models with tumor cell lines expressing HER2 and EGFR.

Bronchitis,Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate),"General Information
A new adult dosing regimen of Augmentin has been approved. Augmentin is an antibiotic used to treat various respiratory-tract infections, including sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia.
In the new regimen, Augmentin is administered twice a day (BID), every 12 hours, in contrast to three-times-a-day regimen used since Augmentin was introduced in the United States.
The BID regimen for more severe infections and infections of the respiratory tract consists of a new tablet containing 875 mg of amoxicillin and 125 mg of clavulanate potassium. In addition, the currently marketed tablet containing 500 mg of amoxicillin and 125 mg of clavulanate potassium can now be prescribed on a twice-a-day regimen for less severe infections that may be treated with a lower dose.
Augmentin should not be used in subjects with a history of allergic reactions to any penicillin or with a previous history of Augmentin-associated cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction.
","Side Effects
The side effects of Augmentin, which are primarily mild and self-limiting, include diarrhea and nausea. In adult subjects treated for more severe infections during clinical trials, there was a 60% reduction in the number of subjects experiencing severe diarrhea or withdrawing from trials because of diarrhea.",,
Bronchitis,Avelox I.V. (moxifloxacin hydrochloride),"General Information
Avelox is an antibacterial agent indicated for the treatment of adults with infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the following conditions: acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community acquired pneumonia, and uncomplicated skin/skin structure infections.
The active ingredient is moxifloxacin hydrochloride. In its I.V. form, Avelox is administered as an introvenous 0.8% sodium chloride solution containing 400 mg moxifloxacin.
Avelox is also available in tablet form.
Clinical Results
A large, randomized, double-blind, contriolled clinical trial was conducted in the United States and Canada to compare the efficacy of Avelox I.V. versus an IV/PO fluroquinolone control (trovafloxacin or levofloxacin), in the treatment of community acquired pneumonia. Each of the 516 patients who were enrolled in the study were given one of the I.V. treatments over a period of 7-14 days. During the 7-30 day post-therapy visit, 362 were evaluated in the primary efficacy analysis. The Avelox therapy had a clinical success rate of 86%, while the fluroquinolone comparators had a 89% success rate.
Another study (open-label) enrolled 628 patients to compare Avelox to sequential IV/PO amoxicillin/clavulanate with or without high-dose IV/PO clarithromycin for the treatment of multiple bacteria. These comparitors are not FDA approved. At the primary efficacy timepoint (Day 5-7), the success rate of Avelox was 93%, while the comparators with or without clarithromycin had a lower success rate of 85%. During the 21-28 day post-therapy visit, the Avelox therapy showed a similar clinical superiority, with a 84% success rate, compared to 74% for the comparators.
","Side Effects
Most adverse reactions to Avelox in clinical trials were mild to moderate. Treatment was discontinued due to drug-related adverse reactions in 5.7% of patients treated sequentially (intravenous followed by oral) in the trials in which the patient population had community acquired pneumonia. The trials in which patients were treated with the tablet form of Avelox alone, saw 3.6% discontinuation due to adverse effects.
In clinical trials, the most common adverse effects were the following:
Nausea (7%)
Diarrhea (6%)
Dizziness (3%)
","Additional Information
For more information about Avelox I.V. and Avelox Tablets, please visit the following web site, sponsored by Bayer: www.Avelox.com.","Mechanism of Action
Moxifloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. The bactericidal action of moxifloxacin results from inhibition of the topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. It appears that the C8-methoxy moiety contributes to enhanced activity and lower selection of resistant mutants of Gram-positive bacteria compared to the C8-H moiety. The presence of the bulky bicycloamine substituent at the C-7 position prevents active efflux, associated with the NorA or pmrA genes seen in certain Gram-positive bacteria.
The mechanism of action for quinolones, including moxifloxacin, is different from that of macrolides, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, or tetracyclines; therfore, microorganisms resistant to these classes of drugs may be susceptible to moxifloxacin and other quinolones. There is no known cross-resistance between mosifloxacin and other classes of anitmicrobials. (From Avelox package insert)

AIDS and AIDS related infections,Clarithromycin (Biaxin),"General Information
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is the most common systemic bacterial infection in subjects with advanced AIDS; it is characterized by fever, night sweats, weight loss or wasting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and is associated with a significant number of AIDS-related deaths.
Clinical Results
Clinical trial results demonstrated that clarithomycin is effective in reducing the risk of developing disseminated MAC disease in subjects with advanced AIDS. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in the United States and Europe, subjects with advanced AIDS (CD4 cell counts less than or equal to 100 cells) and a negative MAC blood culture received either clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (n=341) or placebo twice daily (n=341). The median duration of treatment with clarithromycin was 10.6 months, as compared to a median duration of 8.2 months for the placebo-treated group. The risk of developing disseminated MAC was reduced by 69 percent in the clarithromycin-treated subject group, compared to placebo.
A statistically significant survival benefit was observed with clarithromycin. Mortality was reduced by 31%, 31%, and 20% at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. Since the analysis at 18 months includes subjects no longer receiving prophylaxis, the survival benefit of clarithomycin may be underestimated.
Disseminated MAC developed in 19 of the 341 patients receiving clarithromycin. Eleven of the patients developed strains of MAC which were resistant to clarithromycin. None of the 53 MAC isolates in the placebo group were resistant to clarithromycin.
","Side Effects
The clarithromycin regimen was well tolerated by study participants. The only adverse event significantly more common among subjects treated with clarithromycin than placebo was taste perversion. Other adverse events occurring in 4% of more of the subjects taking clarithromycin include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.
","Additional Information
While only approximately 3% of HIV-positive subjects are diagnosed with disseminated MAC at the time of AIDS diagnosis, studies have shown that up to 40% of these subjects show clinical evidence of disseminated MAC within two years. In addition, MAC has been confirmed post-mortem in up to 50 % of patients with advanced AIDS.
Clarithromycin should not be used in pregnant women except in circumstances where no alternative therapy is appropriate. Calrithromycin should not be used in subjects receiving terfenadine who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities or electrolyte disturbances.",
AIDS and AIDS related infections,Syndros (dronabinol oral solution),"General Information
Syndros is an orally administered liquid formulation of the pharmaceutical cannabinoid dronabinol, a pharmaceutical version of tetrahydrocannabinol (""THC""). Dronabinol has complex effects on the CNS, including central sympathomimetic activity. Cannabinoid receptors have been discovered in neural tissues. These receptors may play a role in mediating the effects of dronabinol.
Syndros is specifically indicated for 1) anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS); and 2) nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments.
Syndros is supplied as a solution for oral administration. The recommended dose is as follows:
Anorexia Associated with Weight Loss in Adult Patients with AIDS:
Starting Dosage: The recommended adult starting dosage of Syndros is 2.1 mg orally twice daily, one hour before lunch and one hour before dinner. In elderly patients, consider initiating Syndros at 2.1 mg once daily one hour before dinner or at bedtime to reduce the risk of central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. Dosing later in the day may reduce the frequency of CNS adverse reactions.
Dosage Titration: If tolerated and further therapeutic effect is desired, the dosage may be increased gradually to 2.1 mg one hour before lunch and 4.2 mg one hour before dinner. Increase the dose of Syndros gradually in order to reduce the frequency of dose-related adverse reactions. Most patients respond to 2.1 mg twice daily, but the dose may be further increased to 4.2 mg one hour before lunch and 4.2 mg one hour before dinner, as tolerated to achieve a therapeutic effect. The maximum dosage is 8.4 mg twice daily.
Nausea and Vomiting Associated with Cancer Chemotherapy in Adult Patients Who Failed Conventional Antiemetics:
Starting Dosage: The recommended starting dosage of Syndros is 4.2 mg/m2 orally administered 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy and then every 2 to 4 hours after chemotherapy for a total of 4 to 6 doses per day. In elderly patients, consider initiating Syndros at 2.1 mg/m2 once daily 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy to reduce the risk of CNS symptoms. Because food delays the absorption of Syndros, administer the first dose on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before eating. Subsequent doses can be taken without regard to meals. Because food can substantially change the systemic exposure to dronabinol and its active metabolite, the timing of dosing in relation to meal times should be kept consistent for each chemotherapy cycle, once the dosage has been determined from the titration process.
Dosage Titration: The dosage can be titrated to clinical response during a chemotherapy cycle or subsequent cycles, based upon initial effect, as tolerated to achieve a clinical effect, in increments of 2.1 mg/m2 . The maximum dosage is 12.6 mg/m2 per dose for 4 to 6 doses per day. Monitor patients for adverse reactions and consider decreasing the dose to 2.1 mg once daily 1 to 3 hours prior to chemotherapy to reduce the risk of CNS adverse reaction.
Clinical Results

AIDS and AIDS related infections,Valcyte (valganciclovir HCl),"General Information
Valcyte tablets have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Valcyte is an oral prodrug of Cytovene, a currently approved and widely prescribed anti-CMV medication.
The active ingredient in Valcyte is valganciclovir, which exists as a mixture of two diastereomers (compounds with the same atoms, but in different arrangements). In the body, the diastereomers are converted to ganciclovir, which inhibits the replication of human cytomegalovirus.
CMV belongs to the family of herpes viruses. The virus remains inactive in individuals with normal immune function; however, it can cause illness in those with compromised immune systems, such as individuals with AIDS or patients taking post-transplant immunosuppressants. In patients with HIV/AIDS, the most common form of CMV is CMV retinitis, an infection of the eye that can lead to blindness.
Clinical Results
A randomized, open-label, controlled trial evaluated 160 subjects with AIDS and newly diagnosed CMV retinitis. Subjects were randomized to receive treatment with either Valcyte tablets or intravenous ganciclovir solution (Cytovene-IV). The median age of the participants was 39 years, the median baseline HIV-1 RNA was 4.9 log10 and the median CD4 cell count was 23 cells/mm3. A determination of CMV retinitis progression by the masked review of retinal photographs taken at baseline and week four was the primary outcome measurement of the three week induction therapy. At four weeks, Valcyte tablets were found to have comparable efficacy for induction therapy when evaluated against Cytovene-IV.
","Side Effects
Adverse events reported from two trials of Valcyte include (but are not limited to) the following:
Diarrhea
Nausea
Pyrexia (fever)
Neutropenia (decreased number of white blood cells)
Anemia

If you are interested in further information on AIDS and CMV, please visit the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","Mechanism of Action
Valganciclovir is an L-valyl ester (prodrug) of ganciclovir that exists as a mixture of two diastereomers. After oral administration, both diastereomers are rapidly converted to ganciclovir by intestinal and hepatic esterases. Ganciclovir is a synthetic analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine, which inhibits replication of human cytomegalovirus in vitro and in vivo.
In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of viral DNA synthesis by ganciclovir triphosphate. (from Valcyte Prescribing/Label Information).

Acne,Amzeeq (minocycline),"General Information
Amzeeq (minocycline) is a tetracycline-class drug. It is a broad-spectrum antibiotic.
Amzeeq is specifically indicated for the topical treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in adults and pediatric patients 9 years of age and older.
Amzeeq is supplied as a foam for topical administration. After shaking the can well, a small amount of topical foam (e.g. a cherry-sized amount) should be expressed from the can onto the fingertips of the hand and then rubbed into acne-affected parts of the face. This should be repeated as needed until all acne-affected parts of the face are treated. If acne is present on other parts of the patientâ€™s body (neck, shoulders, arms, back or chest), additional amounts of topical foam should also be applied to these areas. The topical foam should be applied at approximately the same time each day at least 1 hour before bedtime. The patient should not bathe, shower or swim for at least 1 hour after application of the product.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Amzeeq was based on data from three Phase 3 clinical trials in 2,418 patients of 9 years of age or older, making it one of the largest clinical programs for acne to date. In each 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study, subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris were treated once-daily with Amzeeq or vehicle. No other topical or systemic acne medication was permitted to be used by subjects during the study period. The studies each found statistically significant disease improvement with Amzeeq versus vehicle for the co-primary endpoint of absolute reduction of inflammatory lesions, while studies 2 and 3 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in IGA treatment success. IGA treatment success was defined as a score of 0 (â€œclearâ€�) or 1 (â€œalmost clearâ€�) and at least a two-point decrease from baseline.

Benzamycin is a combination of two active ingredients, benzoyl peroxide and erythromycin, which has proven effective in stopping acne-causing bacteria and reducing acne infection. Erythromycin is an antibiotic produced from a strain of Saccharopolyspora erythraea, whereas benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial and keratolytic agent (causes the break down of keratin).
The term ""acne vulgaris"" refers to the more common form of acne, consisting of non-inflammatory and mildly inflammatory lesions. The more severe form of acne is characterized by the presence of nodules. Nearly 17 million people in the United States have acne, making it the most common skin disease. Although acne is not a serious health threat, severe acne can lead to disfiguring, permanent scarring, which can be upsetting for people who suffer from the disorder.
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions reported occasionally or associated with the use of Benzamycin Topical Gel include the following:
Dryness
Urticarial reaction (hives, itching)
Peeling
Burning sensation
Inflammation of the face, eyes, and nose
Skin discoloration
Oiliness
Tenderness of the skin
","Additional Information
For additional information on Benzamycin, please visit the web site of Dermik Laboratories.","Mechanism of Action
Erythromycin inhibits protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by reversibly binding to 50 S ribosomal subunits, thereby inhibiting translocation of aminoacyl transfer-RNA and inhibiting polypeptide synthesis. Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between erythromycin, lincomycin, chloramphenicol, and clindamycin.
The exact mechanism by which erythromcyin reduces lesions of acne vulgaris is not fully known; however, the effect appears to be due in part to the antibacterial activity of the drug.
Benzoyl peroxide has a keratolytic and desquamative effect which may also contribute to its efficacy. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid. (from Benzamycin Prescribing Information, www.dermik.com)

The more severe form of acne is characterized by the presence of nodules. Nearly 17 million people in the United States have acne, making it the most common skin disease. Although acne is not a serious health threat, severe acne can lead to disfiguring, permanent scarring, which can be upsetting for people who suffer from the disorder.
Clinical Results
Trial results indicated that clindamycin phosphate gel was more effective than a vehicle gel in the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. The 12-week, multicenter, randomized, vehicle-controlled trial compared clindamycin phosphate topical gel, 1% once daily to a vehicle gel administered once daily.
The mean percent reduction in lesion counts at the end of treatment was 51% for clindamycin phosphate gel versus 40% for the vehicle gel for inflammatory lesions. For non-inflammatory lesions, the mean percent reduction was 25% for clindamycin phosphate gel and 12% for the vehicle gel. The total mean percent reduction in lesion counts at the end of treatment was 38% for clindamycin phosphate gel and 27% for the vehicle gel.
In a contact sensitization trial, four of the 200 subjects appeared to develop suggestive evidence of allergic contact sensitization to clindamycin phosphate gel. There was no signal for contact sensitization in the clinical trials under normal use conditions.
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions associated with the use of clindamycin phosphate gel include itching and peeling skin.
Cases of diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis have been reported as adverse reactions in subjects treated with oral and parenteral (intravenous) formulations of clindamycin, and have been reported rarely with topical clindamycin. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal disturbances, as well as gram-negative folliculitis (bacterial infection and inflammation of hair follicles), have also been reported in association with the use of topical formulations of clindamycin.

Acne,Estrostep (norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol),"General Information
Estrostep (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone acetate) is currently marketed for use as an oral contraceptive. In July 2001, the drug received FDA approval for a new indication: the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris (common acne) in females 15 years and older. The drug is designed for women who have no known contraindications to oral contraceptive therapy, and who desire oral contraception and have not responded to topical acne medications.
Over 20 million teenagers suffer from acne according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Furthermore, this common skin disease is not limited to adolescents and can affect men and women well into adulthood. The disease causes physical effects, which may range from moderate irritations to severe, painful lesions or boils, and imparts a psychological and social impact that can lead to poor self-image, embarrassment, anxiety and social isolation.
Clinical Results
Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III trials evaluated Estrostep in the treatment of acne vulgaris. The mean age at enrollment for both groups was 24 years, and a total of 295 subjects received Estrostep while 296 received placebo. At six months, results showed a statistically significant difference between Estrostep and placebo in terms of mean change from baseline in lesion counts. Each trial also demonstrated overall treatment success in the investigator's global evaluation.
","Side Effects
Most side effects of oral contraceptives are not serious. The following side effects have been reported with oral contraceptive use and are believed to be drug-related:
Nausea
Vomiting
Bleeding between menstrual periods
Weight gain
Breast tenderness
Difficulty wearing contact lenses
Migraine
Rash
Mental depression
Edema (fluid retention)
Although serious side effects occur infrequently, an increased risk of the following more severe conditions has been associated with the use of oral contraceptives:
Blood clots in the legs and lungs
Heart attack
Hypertension
Gallbladder disease
Liver tumors
Stroke
As with any medication, please consult a physician for a full list and explanation of possible adverse events.
","Additional Information
Please visit the product web site for additional information on Estrostep.
For more information on acne, please visit the American Academy of Dermatology or the Health Information section of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.","Mechanism of Action
Acne is caused by several factors, including androgen stimulation and sebum production. The combination of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol increases sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and decreases free testosterone; however, the relationship between these changes and a decrease in facial acne in otherwise healthy women has not been established.

Klaron (sodium sulfacet amide lotion ) Lotion, 10% has been approved for the treatment of adult acne.Klaron is a clear, alcohol-free, water-based lotion that has been proven in clinical studies to effectively treat acne.
",,"Additional Information
Acne begins as blemishes beneath the surface of the skin, when oil glands (sebaceous glands) become clogged by skin cells and bacteria that block the opening of the pores. If the blocked pore is closed, it forms a whitehead; if the pore is open it forms a blackhead. Red, inflamed pimples appear when the bacteria breaks through the wall of the whitehead or blackhead.
Acne occurs most often on the face, but also can develop on the chest, shoulders and neck. approximately 17 million people in the U.S. have acne. While the condition is most prevalent among teenagers, it affects people of all ages, from infants to the elderly.",
Acne,Ortho Tri-Cyclen Tablets (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol),"General Information
Ortho Tri-Clyclen Tablets (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol) has been approved as a treatment for acne in women seeking contraception.
Varying levels of severity of acne at different points of the menstrual cycle have been reported. Research has demonstrated that Ortho Tri-Cyclen decreases the level of hormones, which contribute to the development of acne-producing agents, thus attacking the cause of the acne.
Ortho Tri-Cyclen, introduced in 1992, is the only oral contraceptive cleared in the United States for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris in women 15 years of age or older; who have no known contraindication to oral contraceptive therapy; who desire contraception; who have begun menstruation and who are unresponsive to topical anti-acne medications. It is also indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect to use oral contraceptives as a method of contraception.
Clinical Results
In the clinical studies, Ortho Tri-Cyclen showed improvement of acne similar to those seen in studies looking at efficacy or benzoyl peroxide and topical or systemic antibiotics. Ortho Tri-Cyclen treats acne with a combination of ethinyl estradiol, a synthetic estrogen, and norgestimate, a progestin. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies demonstrated that improvement of acne was reported during use of Ortho Tri-Cyclen in more than 80 percent of the studiesâ€™ participants treated with Ortho Tri-Cyclen.",,,
Acne,"Retin-A Micro (tretinoin gel) microsphere, 0.1%","General Information
Retin-A Micro has been approved for the treatment of acne vulgaris. The new acne treatment entraps tretinoin, the active ingredient in RETIN-A, in Microsponge systems (round microscopic particles made of synthetic polymer) and formulates them into a gel. The microspheres hold the medication in reserve, allowing the skin to absorb small amounts of tretinoin over time. Dermatologists who conducted the pivotal clinical studies believe this may be why most RETIN-A MICRO patients experience little or no irritation. The microspheres themselves remain on top of the skin and are easily washed off when patients shower or wash their faces.
Clinical Results
In comparison studies involving approximately 700 patients, Retin-A Micro had demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of acne. In patients with sensitive skin, the unique new gel was significantly less irritating that 0.1% tretinoin cream when applies to opposite facial cheeks in a double-blind study. The lower irritancy of Retin-A Micro is believed to be attributable to the design of its vehicle containing patented Microsponge systems.
","Side Effects
Of those using RETIN-A MICRO, 90 percent experienced no or mild erythema (redness), 84 percent experienced no or slight peeling, 88 percent experienced no or slight burning/stinging, and 91 percent experienced no or slight itching at two weeks - the typical peak irritation period for tretinoin.",,

Acne,Tazorac topical gel,"General Information
Tazorac (tazarotene) 0.05% and 0.1% have been approved for the treatment of stable plaque psoriasis of up to 20 % of body surface area. The 0.1% gel has also been indicated for mild to moderately severe facial acne vulgaris. Tazorac will be available in 30g and 100g tubes.
Clinical Results
Tazorac showed treatment success in up to 70% of patients with stable plaque psoriasis when the gel was applied topically once a day. Tazorac gel showed rapid clinical improvement in plaque psoriasis and sustained a therapeutic effect for up to 12 weeks after treatment. Results from more than 1,400 patients found that up to 70% of patients with trunk limb plaque psoriasis and 60% with knee/elbow plaque psoriasis experienced treatment success, which was defined as good, excellent, or complete clearing of psoriasis. For treatment of common acne, the 0.1% gel demonstrated good to excellent efficacy in up to 70% of patients.
","Side Effects
Tazorac has a well documented safety profile and is safe to use on most parts of the body including the face and scalp. The most frequently reported side effects consist of local irritation including itching, burning, stinging and erythema. Side effects were reported mild-to-moderate and dose related.
","Additional Information
The aqueous topical gel is compatible with moisturizers and cosmetics. Psoriasis has been treated by oral retinoids but their side effects limited use to patients with severe disease. Other, earlier topical retinoids had been used to treat acne but had shown poor efficacy with psoriasis. Tazorac gel has been marketed outside the U.S. under the brand name Zorac.","Mechanism of Action
Tazorac is a receptor-selective retinoid. The gel is thought to normalize epidermal differentiation, reducing the influx of inflammatory cells into the skin. Its topical delivery targets the skin where these processes occur. Synthetic retinoids are vitamin A analogs and are thought to play a role in skin cell differentiation and proliferation.

Acromegaly,Signifor LAR (pasireotide),"General Information
Signifor LAR (pasireotide) is a somatostatin analog.
Signifor LAR is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with acromegaly who have had an inadequate response to surgery and/or for whom surgery is not an option.
Signifor LAR is supplied as an injectable suspension for intramuscular injection. The recommended initial dose is 40 mg administered by intramuscular injection once every 4 weeks (every 28 days). For dose modifications please see drug label.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Signifor LAR for acromegaly was based on two studies in two populations.
Treatment naive population:
A multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of Signifor LAR in subjects with active acromegaly. A total of 358 subjects naÃ¯ve to drugs used to treat acromegaly were randomized to Signifor LAR or another somatostatin analog active comparator. Randomization was stratified based on previous pituitary surgical status. The starting dose of Signifor LAR was 40 mg. Dose increase was allowed in both arms, at the discretion of investigators, after three and six months of treatment if mean GH was greater than or equal to 2.5 mcg/L and/or IGF-1 was greater than the ULN for age and sex. The maximum allowed dose for Signifor LAR was 60 mg. The maximum dose of the active comparator was not used in this trial because the trial was multi-national and the maximum dose approved in the US was not approved in all participating countries. The efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a mean GH level less than 2.5mcg/L and a normal IGF-1 levels at month 12 (age and sex adjusted). The proportion of patients achieving this level of control was 31.3% and 19.2% for Signifor LAR and active comparator, respectively.
Population Inadequately Controlled on other Somatostatin Analog
A multicenter, randomized, 3-arm trial was conducted in subjects with acromegaly inadequately controlled on somatostatin analogs. Subjects were randomized to double-blind Signifor LAR 40 mg (n=65) or Signifor LAR 60 mg (n=65) or to continued open-label pre-trial somatostatin analog therapies at maximal or near
maximal doses (n=68). A total of 181 subjects completed the 6 month trial. The efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with a mean GH level less than 2.5 mcg/L and normal IGF-1 levels at week 24. The primary analysis compared Signifor LAR 60 mg and 40 mg to continued pretrial therapy (i.e., no change in treatment). The proportion of subjects achieving biochemical control was 15.4% and 20.0% for Signifor LAR 40 mg and 60 mg, respectively, at 6 months. Biochemical control was achieved by Month 3 in 15.4% and 18.5% of subjects in the Signifor LAR 40 mg and 60 mg arms, respectively.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Signifor LAR may include, but are not limited to, the following:
diarrhea
cholelithiasis
hyperglycemia
diabetes mellitus
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Signifor LAR or acromegaly, please visit www.signifor.com","Mechanism of Action
Signifor LAR is an injectable cyclohexapeptide somatostatin analog. Pasireotide exerts its pharmacological activity via binding to somatostatin receptors (SSTR). There are five known human somatostatin receptor subtypes: SSTR 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. These receptor subtypes are expressed in different tissues under normal physiological conditions. Somatostatin analogs bind to SSTRs with different potencies. Pasireotide binds with high affinity to four of the five SSTRs. Somatostatin receptors are expressed in many tissues including neuroendocrine tumors (e.g., growth hormone secreting pituitary adenomas). Pasireotide binds to SSTR2 and SSTR5 subtype receptors which may be relevant for inhibition of GH secretion. In vivo studies show that Signifor LAR lowers GH and IGF-1 levels in patients with acromegaly.

Acute myelogenous leukemia,Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin),"General Information
Mylotarg is a chemotherapy agent approved for the treatment of CD33 positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first relapse. It is indicated in patients who are 60 years old or older and who are not considered candidates for other cytotoxic chemotherapy.
The recommended dose of Mylotarg is 9 mg/m2, administered as a 2-hour IV infusion.
Clinical Results
In three trials with Mylotarg, 142 subjects were evaluated in a treatment regimen of two 9mg/m2 doses separated by 14 days and a 28-day follow-up after the last dose. In the first two studies, the subects were 18 years of age or older, and the third study included subjects 60 years of age or older. All subjects had CD33 positive AML in first relapse. The primary endpoint of the studies was the rate of complete remission (CR), defined using the following criteria: 1. leukemic blasts absent from the peripheral blood; 2. 5% or fewer blasts in the bone marrow; 3. Hgb greater than or equal to 9 g/dL, platelates greater than or equal to 100,000/ÂµL, ANC greater than or equal to 1,500/ÂµL; 4. red cell and platelet-transfusion independence.
A second response category, CRp, was also evaluated. CRp is defined using the same criteria as CR, excluding platelate recovery greater than or equal to 100,000/ÂµL. This category was added, because Mylotarg seems to delay platelet recovery in some patients.
Results showed that the overall response rate for the three studies was 30%, with 16% of subjects achieving CR and 13% achieving CRp. For both categories, the median time to remission was 60 days.
Of the subjects acheiving CR or CRp, the median months of relapse-free survival was 6.8. Six subjects had a relapse-free survival of >12 months. Median duration of overall survival for the 142 subjects was 5.9 months.
","Side Effects
The following infusion-related adverse events were experienced by two percent or more of patients receiving Mylotarg during clinical trials:
Chills
Fever
Nausea
Vomiting
Headache
Hypotension
Hypertension
Hypoxia
Dyspnea
Hyperglycemia
Fewer infusion-related adverse events were experienced by patients during the second dose.
","Additional Information
For more information about Mylotarg, please visit the Wyeth pharmaceutical product web site.","Mechanism of Action
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin binds to the CD33 antigen. This antigen is expressed on the surface of leukemic blasts in more than 80% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Binding of the anti-CD33 antibody portion of Mylotarg with the CD33 antigen results in the formation of a complex that is internalized. Upon internalization, the calicheamicin derivative is released inside the lysosomes of the myeloid cell. The released calicheamicin derivative binds to DNA in the minor groove resulting in DNA double strand breaks and cell death. [From the FDA approved product-label.]

Acute Myeloid Leukemia,Daurismo (glasdegib),"General Information
Daurismo (glasdegib) is a hedgehog pathway inhibitor.
Daurismo is specifically indicated for use in combination with low-dose cytarabine for the treatment of newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia in adult patients who are â‰¥75 years old or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy.
Daurismo is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose of is 100 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 28 in combination with cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously twice daily on days 1 to 10 of each 28-day cycle in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or loss of disease control. For patients without unacceptable toxicity, treat for a minimum of 6 cycles to allow time for clinical response.
Daurismo can be taken with or without food and should be administered about the same time each day. Do not split or crush tablets. If a dose of Daurismo is vomited, do not administer a replacement dose; wait until the next scheduled dose is due. If a dose of Daurismo is missed or not taken at the usual time, administer the dose as soon as possible and at least 12 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. Return to the normal schedule the following day. Do not administer two doses of Daurismo within 12 hours.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Daurismo was based on the pivotal, randomized, international Phase II trial BRIGHT 1003. The trial enrolled 115 patients with newly diagnosed AML who were randomized 2:1 to receive Daurismo plus low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) or LDAC alone. Of the 77 patients treated with Daurismo plus LDAC, more than half (51%, 39 patients) had secondary AML, or AML that develops as a result of prior blood/bone marrow conditions or previous anticancer therapy. Eleven of the 39 patients with secondary AML received prior treatment with a hypomethylating agent. Median overall survival was 8.3 months for patients treated with Daurismo plus LDAC compared with 4.3 months for patients treated with LDAC alone. This difference represented a 54 percent reduction in the risk of death for patients treated with Daurismo plus LDAC.

IDHIFA (enasidenib) is a small molecule inhibitor of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) enzyme. Enasidenib targets the mutant IDH2 variants R140Q, R172S, and R172K at approximately 40-fold lower concentrations than the wild-type enzyme in vitro. Inhibition of the mutant IDH2 enzyme by enasidenib led to decreased 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) levels and induced myeloid differentiation in vitro and in vivo in mouse xenograft models of IDH2 mutated AML. In blood samples from patients with AML with mutated IDH2, enasidenib decreased 2-HG levels, reduced blast counts and increased percentages of mature myeloid cells.

Acute Myeloid Leukemia,Xospata (gilteritinib),"General Information
Xospata (gilteritinib) is a kinase inhibitor.
Xospata is specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test.
Xospata is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended starting dose is 120 mg orally once daily with or without food. Response may be delayed. In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, treatment for a minimum of 6 months is recommended to allow time for a clinical response. Do not break or crush Xospata tablets. Administer tablets orally about the same time each day. If a dose of Xospata is missed or not taken at the usual time, administer the dose as soon as possible on the same day, and at least 12 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. Return to the normal schedule the following day. Do not administer 2 doses within 12 hours.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xospata was based on the ADMIRAL trial, which included 138 adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML having a FLT3 mutation. Xospata was given orally at a starting dose of 120 mg daily until unacceptable toxicity or lack of clinical benefit. Dose reductions were allowed, to manage adverse events, and dose increases were allowed, to increase clinical benefit. Efficacy was established on the basis of the rate of complete remission (CR)/complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), the duration of CR/CRh (DOR), and the rate of conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence in the ADMIRAL trial. Among the 106 patients who were dependent on red blood cell (RBC) and/or platelet transfusions at baseline, 33 (31.1%) became independent of RBC and platelet transfusions during any 56-day post-baseline period. For the 32 patients who were independent of both RBC and platelet transfusions at baseline, 17 (53.1%) remained transfusion-independent during any 56-day post-baseline period. Twenty-one percent of patients achieved complete remission (no evidence of disease and full recovery of blood counts) or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (no evidence of disease and partial recovery of blood counts) with treatment.

Acute Pain,Belbuca (buprenorphine),"General Information
Belbuca buccal film contains buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist.
Belbuca is specifically indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.
Belbuca is supplied as a buccal film for oral administration. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patientâ€™s severity of pain, response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. Iitiate treatment in opioid naÃ¯ve patients with a 75 mcg film once daily or, if tolerated, every 12 hours for at least 4 days, then increase dose to 150 mcg every 12 hours. Individual titration to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions should proceed in increments of 150 mcg every 12 hours, no more frequently than every 4 days. Doses up to 450 mcg every 12 hours were studied in opioid naÃ¯ve patients in the clinical trials.
Please see drug label foe dosing in specific populations, conversions from other analgesics/opioids and titrations and maintenance dosing.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Belbuca was based on three 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in opioid-naÃ¯ve and opioid-experienced patients with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain using pain scores as the primary efficacy variable. Two of these studies demonstrated efficacy in patients with low back pain. One study in low back pain did not show a statistically significant pain reduction for Belbuca compared to placebo.
12-Week Study in Opioid-NaÃ¯ve Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain
A total of 749 patients with chronic low back pain entered an open-label, dose-titration period for up to eight weeks. Patients initiated therapy with a single 75 mcg dose of Belbuca on Day 1 and continued taking Belbuca 75 mcg either once daily or every 12 hours for 4-8 days as tolerated. The dose was then increased to 150 mcg every 12 hours, and patients could continue to dose escalate in 150 mcg dose increments every 4-8 days for up to 6 weeks if the adverse effects were tolerable and the analgesic effects were not adequate. Patients who achieved adequate analgesia and tolerable adverse effects on Belbuca for at least 2 weeks were then randomized to continue their titrated dose of Belbuca or matching placebo. Sixty-one percent (61%) of the patients who entered the open-label dose titration period were able to titrate to a tolerable and effective dose and were randomized into a 12-week, double-blind treatment period.
During the first 2 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients were allowed up to 2 tablets per day of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg as supplemental analgesia to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in patients randomized to placebo. Thereafter, the supplemental analgesia was limited to 1 to 2 tablets of acetaminophen 500 mg per day. Seventy-six percent of the patients treated with Belbuca completed the 12-week treatment compared to 73% of the patients treated with placebo. Of the 209 patients randomized to Belbuca, 4% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 8% due to adverse events. Of the 211 patients randomized to placebo, 11% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 4% due to adverse events.
Of the patients who were randomized, the mean pain (SD) scores on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) were 7.1 (1.06) and 7.2 (1.05) prior to open-label titration and 2.8 (1.01) and 2.8 (1.12) at the beginning of the double-blind period for Belbuca and placebo, respectively. The change from double-blind baseline to week 12 in mean pain (SD) NRS score was statistically significant favoring patients treated with Belbuca, compared with patients treated with placebo. A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (62%) had at least a 30% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint when compared to patients who received placebo buccal film (47%). A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (41%) also had at least a 50% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint compared to patients who received placebo (33%).
12-Week Study in Opioid-Experienced Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain
Eight hundred and ten (810) patients on chronic opioid therapy (total daily dose 30-160 mg in oral morphine sulfate equivalents (MSE) for at least 4 weeks) entered an open-label, dose-titration period with Belbuca for up to 8 weeks, following taper of their prior opioids to 30 mg oral MSE daily. Patients were initiated with Belbuca150 mcg every 12 hours if they were on 30 to 89 mg oral MSE daily and 300 mcg every 12 hours if they were on 90 to160 mg oral MSE daily prior to taper. If a patient tolerated the adverse events and the analgesic effects were not adequate, the dose was increased in increments of 150 mcg every 12 hours after 4 to 8 days for up to 6 weeks. Patients were permitted to take hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg as analgesic rescue as needed up to a maximum of 4 doses per day during the open-label dose titration period. After a dose was reached with adequate analgesia and tolerable adverse effects for a period of 2 weeks, patients were randomized to continue their titrated dose of Belbuca or matching placebo. Sixty-three percent (63%) of the patients who entered the open-label titration period were able to titrate to a tolerable and effective dose and were randomized into a 12-week double-blind treatment phase. Ten percent (10%) of patients discontinued due to an adverse event, 8% discontinued due to lack of a therapeutic effect, and 0.1% discontinued due to opioid withdrawal during the open-label titration period. The remaining 20% of patients discontinued due to various non drug related administrative reasons.
During the double-blind period, patients were permitted to take up to 2 doses of 5/325 mg or 10/650 mg of hydrocodone/acetaminophen per day for the first 2 weeks to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in patients randomized to placebo. After the first 2 weeks, patients were permitted to take 1 dose of 5/325 mg or 10/650 mg per day. Eighty-three percent of patients treated with Belbuca and 57% of patients treated with placebo buccal film completed the 12-week treatment period. Of the 243 patients randomized to Belbuca, 8% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 2% due to adverse events. Of the 248 patients randomized to placebo buccal film, 25% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 5% due to adverse events.
Of the patients who were randomized into the double-blind period, the mean pain (SD) NRS scores were 6.8 (1.28) and 6.6 (1.32) prior to open-label titration and 2.9 (0.985) and 2.8 (1.05) at the beginning of the double-blind period for Belbuca and placebo, respectively. The change from baseline to week 12 in mean pain (SD) NRS score was statistically significant in favor of patients treated with Belbuca compared with patients treated with placebo. A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (64%) had at least a 30% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint when compared to patients who received placebo buccal film (31%). A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (39%) also had at least a 50% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint compared to patients who received placebo (17%).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Belbuca may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Acute Pain,Omidria (phenylephrine and ketorolac injection),"General Information
Omidria (phenylephrine and ketorolac injection) is a combination of an anti-inflammatory agent and a mydriatic agent (causes pupil dilation, called mydriasis).
Omidria is specifically indicated for use during cataract surgery or intraocular lens replacement for maintaining pupil size by preventing intraoperative miosis and reducing postoperative ocular pain.
Omidria is supplied as a solution for intraocular administration. For administration 4 mL of Omidria is diluted in 500 mL of ophthalmic irrigation solution. Irrigation solution is to be used as needed for the surgical procedure.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Omidria was based on three phase III randomized, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 808 adult subjects undergoing cataract surgery or intraocular lens replacement. Subjects were randomized to either Omidria or placebo. Subjects were treated with preoperative topical mydriatic and anesthetic agents. Pupil diameter was measured throughout the surgical procedure. Postoperative pain was evaluated by self-administered 0-100 mm visual analog scales (VAS). Mydriasis was maintained in the Omidria-treated groups while the placebo-treated groups experienced progressive constriction. At the end of cortical clean-up, 23% of placebo-treated subjects and 4% of Omidria-treated subjects had a pupil diameter less than 6 mm (p < 0.01). Pain during the initial 10-12 hours postoperatively was statistically significantly less in the Omidria-treated groups than in the placebo-treated groups. During the 10-12 hours postoperatively, 26% of Omidria-treated subjects reported no pain (VAS = 0 at all timepoints) while 17% of placebo-treated subjects reported no pain (p < 0.01).

Omidria contains the active ingredienta phenylephrine and ketorolac. Phenylephrine is an a1-adrenergic receptor agonist and, in the eye, acts as a mydriatic agent by contracting the radial muscle of the iris. Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory that inhibits both cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), resulting in a decrease in tissue concentrations of prostaglandins to reduce pain due to surgical trauma. Ketorolac, by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis secondary to ocular surgical insult or direct mechanical stimulation of the iris, also prevents surgically induced miosis.

The analgesic efficacy of Troxyca ER was evaluated in one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain. This study utilized an enriched-enrollment, randomized-withdrawal design and was conducted in a population consisting of both opioid-experienced and opioid-naÃ¯ve subjects. Subjects were titrated to effect with Troxyca ER in the open-label period, which was followed by a 12-week double-blind treatment period. Total daily doses of the oxycodone in Troxyca ER ranged from 20 mg to 160 mg administered in two equal doses approximately 12 hours apart. Subjects with controlled pain (defined as pain intensity numerical rating scale [NRS] â‰¤4) were randomized into the 12-week double-blind treatment period to either continue Troxyca ER or be switched to placebo. Subjects randomized to placebo were given a blinded taper of Troxyca ER according to a pre-specified schedule to prevent opioid withdrawal. Rescue medication (up to 3 grams per day of acetaminophen) was allowed throughout the study to treat episodes of breakthrough pain. Immediate-release oxycodone HCl (as a single ingredient product) was also allowed during the first 3 weeks of the open-label period to manage the initial conversion from prior therapy.
A total of 410 subjects entered the open-label titration period and 281 were successfully titrated onto Troxyca ER and randomized into the double-blind treatment period: 134 to placebo and 147 to Troxyca ER. Of these, 42.5% of subjects were previously treated with an opioid. The mean change in the weekly average pain intensity NRS scores from randomization baseline to the average of Weeks 11 and 12 was statistically significantly superior for those treated with Troxyca ER compared to placebo. A higher percentage of subjects receiving Troxyca ER, compared to placebo, had a â‰¥30% decrease in their weekly average NRS-pain intensity scores from Screening to Weeks 11 and 12 of the double-blind treatment period (58% versus 44% for Troxyca ER and placebo, respectively), while, 40% of subjects receiving Troxyca ER and 30% of subjects receiving placebo had a 50% decrease.
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions associated with the use of Troxyca ER may include, but are not limited to, the following:
nausea
constipation
vomiting
headache
somnolence
Troxyca ER comes with a Black Box warning of the potential for Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, Accidental ingestion, neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) can result in fatal overdose of oxycodone from Troxyca ER.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Troxyca ER or severe pain, please visit http://www.pfizer.com/","Mechanism of Action
Troxyca ER is an extended release capsule formulation of oxycodone combined with naltrexone. Oxycodone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that reverses the subjective and analgesic effects of mu-opioid receptor agonists by competitively binding at mu-opioid receptors.

Acute Pain,Xartemis XR (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen) extended release,"General Information
c.
Xartemis XR is specifically indicated for the management of acute pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.
Xartemis XR is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is 2 tablets every 12 hours administered with or without food. The second dose of 2 tablets may be administered as early as 8 hours after the initial dose if patients require analgesia at that time. Subsequent doses are to be administered 2 tablets every 12 hours. The tablets should be swallowed whole, one at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in mouth. Do not break, chew, crush, cut, dissolve or split the tablets. Breaking, chewing, crushing, cutting, dissolving or splitting Xartemis XR tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can lead to overdose or death.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xartemis XR was based on a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel arm multi dose study comparing Xartemis XR and placebo in 303 subjects with acute pain following a unilateral first metatarsal bunionectomy. All subjects met the criteria of pain intensity >4 on a 0 to 10 numerical pain rating scale and received a fixed-dose of 2 tablets of Xartemis XR (7.5 mg oxycodone hydrochloride and 325 mg acetaminophen) tablets or placebo every 12 hours over 48 hours. Ibuprofen 400 mg every 4 hours as needed was allowed as rescue medication. Mean baseline pain intensity scores were 6.2 in the Xartemis XR group and 6.0 in the placebo group. Approximately 85% of the 150 subjects treated with Xartemis XR and 98% of the 153 subjects treated with placebo took rescue medication at least once for pain management during the 48 hours after the first dose. Rescue medication was used by less than 50% of the Xartemis XR-treated patients after the first dose interval. Pain intensity was recorded at 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours after each dose, with additional recordings at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes after the first dose. The median time to onset of pain relief was less than one hour for Xartemis XR. The primary endpoint was the summed pain intensity difference (change in pain from baseline) over 48 hours (SPID48), which demonstrated improvement in pain from baseline for the Xartemis XR treatment group compared to placebo.

Acute Pain,Zingo (lidocaine hydrochloride monohydrate),"General Information
Zingo (lidocaine hydrochloride monohydrate) is a powder intradermal injection system. It delivers lidocaine hydrochloride monohydrate into the dermis. Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent that blocks sodium ion channels required for the initiation and conduction of neuronal impulses, resulting in local anesthesia.
Zingo is specifically indicated for use on intact skin to provide local analgesia prior to venipuncture or peripheral intravenous cannulation in adults and in children 3-18 years of age, and to avoid pain associated with venous access procedures.
Zingo is supplied as a powder injection system for intradermal administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 0.5 mg applied one to three minutes prior to needle insertion.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Zingo was based on the results of two clinical trials in pediatrics and a single trial in adults.
Pediatric trials:
These randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, sham-placebo controlled studies enrolled subjects 3-18 years of age. The population included healthy subjects as well as those with acute and chronic medical conditions. The subjects received Zingo or a placebo device at the back of hand or antecubital fossa, between one and three minutes prior to venipuncture or peripheral venous cannulation. Measurements of pain were made immediately following the venous procedure. Efficacy was measured using a modified version of the Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no hurt) to 5 (hurts worst).
Study One
The Adjusted Mean, least squares mean (LSM) for the Zingo group was 1.77 and for the placebo group 2.10, for a difference in LSMs of -0.33 (0.13) and 95% confidence limits of -0.58, -0.08, respectively.
Study Two
The Adjusted Mean, least squares mean (LSM) for the Zingo group was 1.38 and for the placebo group 1.77, for a difference in LSM's of -0.39 (0.13) and 95% confidence limits of -0.65 and -0.13, respectively.
Adult trial:
The efficacy of Zingo in adults was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, sham-placebo controlled trial in which adult patients who required a venipuncture or peripheral venous cannulation received either Zingo or a sham placebo device. Patients were treated with Zingo or a placebo device at the antecubital fossa or back of the hand, between one and three minutes prior to venipuncture or peripheral venous cannulation. Measurements of pain were made immediately following the procedure. Efficacy was measured using a continuous 100 mm visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (â€œno painâ€�) to 100 (â€œworst possible painâ€�). Many of the patients had chronic medical problems such as depression, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia and over one fourth of the population may have been at higher than average risk of dermal bleeding due to use of concomitant medications such as NSAIDs, aspirin, and corticosteroids. Treatment with active drug resulted in less pain compared with placebo. Adjusted Mean, LSM: Zingo: 11.61 and placebo: 16.23. Difference in LSMs (SE2): -4.62 (1.55). 95% Confidence Limits -7.67, -1.57. However, efficacy was primarily seen in patients undergoing venipuncture at the antecubital fossa, while patients undergoing cannulation at the back of the hand did not demonstrate a difference between active and sham administrations.

There should be 5 to 6 hours between each dose. The total daily dosage of Lucemyra should not exceed 2.88 mg (16 tablets) and no single dose should exceed 0.72 mg (4 tablets). Lucemyra treatment may be continued for up to 14 days with dosing guided by symptoms. Discontinue Lucemyra with a gradual dose reduction over a 2- to 4-day period to mitigate Lucemyra withdrawal symptoms.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Lucemyra was based on two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.
Study 1
Study 1 was a 2-part efficacy, safety, and dose-response study conducted in the United States in patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence who were physically dependent on short-acting opioids (e.g., heroin, hydrocodone, oxycodone). The first part of the study was an inpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design consisting of 7 days of inpatient treatment (Days 1-7) with Lucemyra 2.16 mg total daily dose (0.54 mg 4 times daily) (n=229), Lucemyra 2.88 mg total daily dose (0.72 mg 4 times daily) (n=222), or matching placebo (n=151). Patients also had access to a variety of support medications for withdrawal symptoms.The second part of the study (Days 8-14) was an open-label design where all patients who successfully completed Days 1-7 were eligible to receive open-label treatment with variable-dose Lucemyra treatment (as determined by the investigator, but not to exceed 2.88 mg total daily dose) for up to an additional 7 days (Days 8-14) in either an inpatient or outpatient setting as determined by the investigator and the patient. No patient received Lucemyra for more than 14 days. The two endpoints to support efficacy were the mean Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale of Gossop (SOWS-Gossop) total score on Days 1 â€“ 7 of treatment and the proportion of patients that completed 7 days of treatment. Of the randomized and treated patients, 28% of placebo patients, 41% of Lucemyra 2.16 mg, and 40% of Lucemyra 2.88 mg patients completed 7 days of treatment. The difference in proportion in both Lucemyra groups was significant compared to placebo. The mean SOWS-Gossop scores for Days 1 â€“ 7 were 8.8, 6.5, and 6.1 for placebo, Lucemyra 2.16 mg and Lucemyra 2.88 mg, respectively, which was also significant.
Study 2
This was an inpatient, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study carried out in the United States in patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence who were physically dependent on short-acting opioids (e.g., heroin, hydrocodone, oxycodone). Patients were treated with Lucemyra tablets (2.88 mg/day [0.72 mg four times daily]) or matching placebo for 5 days (Days 1-5). Patients also had access to a variety of support medications for withdrawal symptoms. All patients then received placebo on Days 6 and 7 and were discharged on Day 8. The two endpoints to support efficacy were the mean SOWS-Gossop total score on Days 1 â€“ 5 of treatment and the proportion of patients that completed 5 days of treatment. The SOWS-Gossop was administered at baseline and once daily 3.5 hours after the first morning dose on Days 1 â€“ 5. A total of 264 patients were randomized into the study. Of the randomized and treated patients, 33% of placebo patients and 49% of Lucemyra patients completed 5 days of treatment. The difference in proportion between the two groups was significant. The mean SOWS-Gossop scores for Days 1 â€“ 5 were 8.9 and 7.0 for placebo and Lucemyra 2.88 mg, respectively, which was statistically significant.

Keytruda is supplied as a solution for intravenous administration. The recommended dose of Keytruda for gastric cancer is 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.
The FDA approval of Keytruda was based on KEYNOTE-059, a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label multi-cohort trial that enrolled 259 patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who progressed on at least 2 prior systemic treatments for advanced disease. Previous treatment must have included a fluoropyrimidine and platinum doublet. Patients received Keytruda 200 mg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression that was symptomatic, rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at least 4 weeks later with repeat imaging. Patients without disease progression were treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 6 to 9 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, as assessed by blinded independent central review, and duration of response. Among the 259 patients, 55% (n = 143) had tumors that expressed PD-L1. For the 143 patients, the ORR was 13.3%; 1.4% had a complete response and 11.9% had a partial response.

Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD 1)-blocking, humanized monoclonal IgG4 kappa antibody. Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response.

The median decrease in anti-Factor Xa activity from baseline was 97 percent for rivaroxaban and 92 percent for apixaban. Interim data from the ongoing ANNEXA-4 single-arm, open-label study in patients with major bleeding also were assessed by the FDA as part of its review and approval. Data from 185 evaluable patients showed that Andexxa rapidly and significantly reversed anti-Factor Xa activity when administered as a bolus and sustained this reversal when followed by a 120-minute infusion. The median decrease from baseline was 90 percent for rivaroxaban and 93 percent for apixaban.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Andexxa may include, but are not limited to, the following:
urinary tract infections

The Andexxa label comes with the following Boxed Warning:
Treatment with Andexxa has been associated with serious and life-threatening adverse events, including: Arterial and venous thromboembolic events. Ischemic events, including myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.Cardiac arrest. Sudden deaths. Monitor for thromboembolic events and initiate anticoagulation when medically appropriate. Monitor for symptoms and signs that precede cardiac arrest and provide treatment as needed.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Andexxa or the reversal of factor Xa inhibitors, please visit https://www.andexxa.com/","Mechanism of Action
Andexxa is a recombinant protein specifically designed to bind to Factor Xa inhibitors and rapidly reverse their anticoagulant effect. Andexxa is a modified form of the human Factor Xa molecule, an enzyme that helps blood clot. Andexxa works by acting as a decoy for oral and injectable Factor Xa inhibitors, which target and bind to Factor Xa, which allows them to exert their anticoagulant effect. When Andexxa is given to a patient with Factor Xa inhibitor-related bleeding, it binds to the Factor Xa inhibitor and prevents it from inhibiting the activity of Factor Xa and reverses the anticoagulant effects of the inhibitor.

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Kcentra was based on a randomized, controlled Phase IIIb study in 212 evaluable subjects. The study compared Kcentra (4-factor PCC) and vitamin K with plasma and vitamin K for urgent warfarin reversal in patients with acute major bleeding. Kcentra achieved the endpoints of hemostatic efficacy with respect to the adequacy of stopping a major bleed assessed at 24 hours from the start of infusion (72.4% of patients receiving Kcentra versus 65.4% receiving plasma) and INR reduction (1.3) at 30 minutes post treatment (62.2% of patients receiving Kcentra versus 9.6% receiving plasma). The secondary endpoints included plasma levels of major clotting factors (Factors II, VII, IX, X, proteins C and S); time to INR correction; and safety and tolerability (including all-cause mortality). A single Kcentra infusion produced a rapid and sustained increase in plasma levelsof clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X within 30 minutes post-treatment (p values<0.0001) with 87 percent less volume (105 mL +/-37 mL versus 865 mL +/- 269 mL) than plasma. Additionally, infusion time with Kcentra was seven times faster than with plasma (24 minutes versus nearly 3 hours for plasma). The most common adverse reactions (frequency 2.8%) observed in subjects receiving Kcentra were headache, nausea/vomiting, arthralgia, and hypotension.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Myalept or lipodystrophy, please visit the Bristol-Myers Squibb web page.","Mechanism of Action
Myalept (metreleptin for injection) is a recombinant human leptin analog for injection that binds to and activates the leptin receptor. Adipocytes store lipids to meet the fuel requirements of non-adipose tissues during fasting. In patients with generalized lipodystrophy, the deficiency of adipose tissue leads to hypertriglyceridemia and ectopic deposition of fat in non-adipose tissues such as liver and muscle, contributing to metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance. Native leptin is a hormone predominantly secreted by adipose tissue that informs the central nervous system of the status of energy stores in the body. In patients with generalized lipodystrophy, leptin deficiency, resulting from the loss of adipose tissue, contributes to excess caloric intake, which exacerbates the metabolic abnormalities. Myalept exerts its function by binding to and activating the human leptin receptor (ObR), which belongs to the Class I cytokine family of receptors that signals through the JAK/STAT transduction pathway.

Sustol (granisetron) is a serotonin-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. During chemotherapy that induces vomiting, mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin, which stimulates 5-HT3 receptors. This evokes vagal afferent discharge, inducing vomiting. Animal studies demonstrate that, in binding to 5-HT3 receptors, granisetron blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin.

Alcohol Dependence,Campral (acamprosate calcium),"General Information
Campral (acamprosate) is a structural analogue of the amino acid homotaurine and the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). While it's specific mechanism of action is not entirely understood, neurotransmossion systems involving GABA and it's excitatory counterpart glutamate are observed to be thrown out of equilibrium when chronically exposed to alcohol; Campral, by mimicing GABA's actions and interacting with these systems directly, is thought to help restore this equilibrium.
It is specifically indicated for the maintenance of abstinence from alcohol in patients with alcohol dependence who are abstinent at treatment initiation. It has not been established as effective for initiating abstinence in patients who have not done so on their own prior to taking the drug, and it was designed to be a portion of a full behavioral and pharmacological treatment program. Campral has also not been shown to be effective in patients with multiple subtance dependencies including alcohol.
Campral is administered as an oral tablet, with a recommended dosage of two tablets (each containing 333 mg of Campral) thrice daily.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Campral was based on three double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies enrolling a combined total of 998 subjects. The trials ranged from 90 to 360 days, with all subjects receiving at least one dose of Campral or placebo. All subjects had a history of alcohol abuse and dependence, and all had undergone inpatient detoxification and were abstinent from alcohol on the day of randomization. All subjects received their treatment in combination with standard psychosocial couselling. In all three studies, treatment with Campral yielded a greater portion of subjects maintaining abstinence than with placebo.
A fourth clinical study invesigated the efficacy of Campral in subjects with multiple substance dependencies, and in patients who had not established abstinence prior to dosing. In these studies, Campral was not shown to be superior to placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Campral may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Grastek contains pollen allergen extract from Timothy grass (Phleum pratense).The precise mechanisms of action of allergen immunotherapy are not known.
Grastek is specifically indicated for use in subjects ages 5 through 65 years as immunotherapy for the treatment of grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis confirmed by positive skin test or in vitro testing for pollen-specific IgE antibodies for Timothy grass or cross-reactive grass pollens.
Grastek is is supplied as a tablet for sublingual (under the tongue) administration. The recommended dose is one tablet daily. The first dose should be administered in a healthcare setting under the supervision of a physician with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases. The patient should be observed for at least 30 minutes to monitor for signs or symptoms of a severe systemic or a severe local allergic reaction. If the patient tolerates the first dose, subsequent doses may be taken at home. Treatment should be initiated at least 12 weeks before the expected onset of each grass pollen season and continue treatment throughout the season.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Grastek in the treatment of allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis in Timothy grass pollen allergic subjects 5 years of age and older, with or without mild asthma, was evaluated during the first grass pollen season in two trials of approximately 24 weeks treatment duration. The sustained effect of Grastek was evaluated in one trial conducted over 5 grass pollen seasons. All three trials were randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials. Subjects had a history of grass pollen induced rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis and sensitivity to Timothy grass pollen as determined by specific testing (IgE). In these three studies, subjects initiated Grastek or placebo approximately 12 weeks prior to the pollen season. In the long-term study, subjects received Grastek or placebo daily for 3 consecutive years and were followed for 2 years without treatment. Subjects were allowed to take symptom relieving medications. Efficacy was established by self-reporting of rhinoconjunctivitis daily symptom scores (DSS) and daily medication scores (DMS). Daily rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms included four nasal symptoms (runny nose, stuffy nose, sneezing, and itchy nose), and two ocular symptoms (gritty/itchy eyes and watery eyes). The rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms were measured on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The sums of the DSS and DMS were combined into the Total Combined Score (TCS) which was averaged over the entire grass pollen season.
First Season Efficacy
Adults and Children
This placebo-controlled trial evaluated 1,501 subjects 5 through 65 years of age and compared Grastek to placebo administered as a sublingual tablet daily for approximately 24 weeks. TCS score over Entire season: Grastek: 3.24 versus placebo: 4.22. TCS score over Peak season: Grastek: 3.33 versus placebo: 4.22.

Qnasl nasal aerosol contains the active ingredient beclomethasone dipropionate, an anti-inflammatory steroid.
Qnasl is specifically indicated for the treatment of the nasal symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older.
Qnasl is supplied as a non-aqueous nasal spray solution designed for intranasal inhalation. The recommended dose of Qnasl is 320 mcg per day administered as two nasal aerosol sprays in each nostril (80 mcg/aerosol spray) once daily (maximum total daily dose of four nasal aerosol sprays per day).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Qnasl was based on three randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials in a total of 1,049 subjects. The three clinical trials included one two-week dose-ranging trial in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis, one two-week efficacy trial in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis, and one six-week efficacy trial in subjects with perennial allergic rhinitis. The subjects received Qnasl 320 mcg once daily administered as two sprays in each nostril or placebo. Assessment of efficacy was based on the total nasal symptom score (TNSS), with the primary endpoint of improvement on TNSS versus placebo when measured from baseline to the end of treatment. TNSS was measured as reflective (rTNSS) or instantaneous (iTNSS). rTNSS required the subjects to record symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; iTNSS required the subjects to record symptom severity over the previous 10 minutes.
Dose-Ranging Trial:
This two-week trial evaluated the efficacy of three doses of beclomethasone dipropionate nasal aerosol (80, 160, and 320 mcg, once daily) in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The 320 mcg/day dose resulted in statistically significant improvements compared with placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint, rTNSS, as well as a statistically significant decrease in morning iTNSS versus placebo, indicating that the effect was maintained over the 24-hour dosing interval.
Seasonal and Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Trials:
In both trials once daily treatment with Qnasl nasal aerosol for two weeks in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis and for six weeks in subjects with perennial allergic rhinitis resulted in statistically significant greater decreases from baseline in the rTNSS and morning iTNSS than placebo.

Egg allergy,NasalCrom Nasal Spray,"General Information
NasalCrom Nasal Spray has been approved for the treatment of nasal allergy symptoms, for use in children ages two to five years. It is the only treatment indicated for all nasal allergy symptoms that is available over-the-counter (OTC). For best results, this medication should be taken for one full week before coming in contact with allergens and should then be taken three to four times daily.
NasalCrom was first introduced, in 1983, as a prescription medication for adults. In 1997 it became available OTC for adults as well as children ages six and older. Unilke other OTC allergy treatments, NasalCrom does not produce unwanted side effects, such as drowsiness or jitteriness.
It is estimated that nearly 40 percent of children under the age of six have allergic rhinitis and that this condition causes more than 800,000 missed school days in older children.
Clinical Results
NasalCrom was evaluated as a treatment for nasal allergy symptoms in a multi-center, multi-dose, randomized, double-blind study of 200 children, ages two to six years, who suffer from allergic rhinitis. Results showed that NasalCrom, after one week of treatment, was more effective than placebo in alleviating nasal allergy symptoms. The drug was well tolerated and demonstrated a side effect profile similar to placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of cromolyn sodium may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Irritation inside of nose

","Additional Information
For additional information on NasalCrom, please visit Pharmacia.","Mechanism of Action
NasalCrom Nasal Spray (cromolyn sodium) works as a mast-cell stabilizer, blocking cells in the body from releasing substances that cause the bronchial tubes to tighten and constrict. Normally, upon entering the nose, an allergen triggers the mast cells that line the nasal passages to break down and release histamines, which cause nasal allergy symptoms. NasalCrom provides a protective layer that shields mast cells from these allergens.

Egg allergy,Patanase (olopatadine hydrochloride),"General Information
Patanase is an antihistamine with selective H1 -receptor antagonist activity: its principal effects are mediated via inhibition of H1 receptors.
Patanase is specifically indicated for the relief of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 12 years of age and older.
Patanase is supplied as a metered-dose manual spray pump designed for intranasal administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is two sprays per nostril twice daily. Patanase must be primed before initial use and when it has not been used for more than 7 days.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Patanase was based on the results of three clinical trials. These randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo (vehicle nasal spray)-controlled clinical trials 1,598 subjects, aged 12 years and older, in the United States. The subjects received Patanase Nasal Spray 0.6%, Patanase Nasal Spray 0.4%, or vehicle nasal spray, two sprays per nostril, twice-daily. The duration of the study was two weeks. Efficacy was based on patient recording of 4 individual nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, and sneezing) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 3 = severe) as reflective or instantaneous scores. Reflective scoring recorded symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; instantaneous scoring recorded symptom severity at the time of recording. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference from placebo in the percent change from baseline in the sum of morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) at the end of the treatment period. In all studies Patanase exhibited statistically significantly greater decreases in rTNSS compared to vehicle nasal spray. Study One: In the Patanase 0.6% and 0.4% groups, the change from baseline was -3.63 and -3.38, respectively, compared to -2.67 for the placebo group (p <0.0001 for the high dose group). Study Two: In the Patanase 0.6% and 0.4% groups, the change from baseline was -2.90 and -2.63, respectively, compared to -1.92 in the placebo group (p<0.0001 for the high dose group).
Onset of action was evaluated in three environmental exposure unit studies. In these studies, subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to high levels of pollen in an environmental exposure unit and then treated with either Patanase Nasal Spray or vehicle nasal spray, two sprays in each nostril. Afterwards they self-reported their allergy symptoms hourly as instantaneous scores for the subsequent 12 hours. Patanase 0.6% was found to have an onset of action of 30 minutes after dosing in the environmental exposure unit and a twelve hour duration of effect.

Alzheimer's disease,ARICEPT (donepezil hydrochloride),"General Information
Aricept has been approved for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Aricept is effective in improving cognition and patient function in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease.
Clinical Results
Controlled clinical trials in over 900 subjects demonstrated that more than 80% of subjects taking Aricept either improved or exhibited no further demonstration in tests of cognition over the course of the studies. In an assessment of patient function, which includes general function, cognition, behavior and activities of daily living, clinicians rated approximately two times as many subjects on Aricept as improved in comparison to placebo after 24 weeks of treatment.
",,,"Mechanism of Action
Aricept is a new reversible inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme, which breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Aricept may allow a greater concentration of acetylcholine in the brain, thereby improving cholinergic function. Acetylcholine, associated with memory and learning, is in short supply in subjects with Alzheimer's disease."
Alzheimer's disease,Exelon (rivastigmine tartrate),"General Information
Exelon has been approved in oral solution and capsule form for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. This drug belongs to the class of drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors. Cholinesterase breaks down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter which assists in human memory and cognition processes. By inhibiting cholinesterase, more acetylcholine available to the patient for memory and cognitive functioning. This is effective in treatment of Alzheimer's disease, since acetylcholine is at significantly lower levels in Alzheimer's patients than in normally functioning people.
Exelon has been shown to improve patients' performance in the three major domains of assessment of Alzheimer's: global functioning (such as activities of daily living), behavior, and cognition.
Another long term advantage to the drug is that it could treat symptoms early on in the deterioration process. Delaying the onset of the disease by five years in patients could save up to $50 billion in U.S. healthcare costs annually (half of the current annual cost).
Currently, 70 countries have approved Exelon for marketing.
Alzheimer's Disease is a neurodegenerative disease affecting up to 4 million adults in the U.S. and 10 million worldwide. Memory loss and other cognitive and behavior deteriorations are symptoms of the disease. As there is no current cure, Alzheimer's Disease is fatal.
Clinical Results
The safety and efficacy of Exelon was investigated in two placebo-controlled investigations. Participants, all Alzheimer's patients, were evaluated in terms of their cognitive performance using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and the Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change (CIBIC-Plus). The ADAS-cog considers elements of memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language and praxis. Improvement in global functioning was measured by the CIBIC-Plus. This instrument of evaluation considers overall patient cognition, behavior and functioning. The patient population for this study reflected a real world population, since most of the patients used concomitant medications to treat other conditions during the studies.
In a 26-week, U.S. study, patients were divided into three groups, each receiving 1-4 mg/day of Exelon, 6-12 mg/day of Exelon, or placebo. At the end of the treatment period, both ADAS-cog scores and CIBIC-Plus ratings for those treated in either dose-group of Exelon were significantly superior than scores of those who took placebo. Furthermore, the higher-dosage group had better ADAS-cog scores and CIBIC-Plus ratings than the lower-dosage group. Better scores in these assessments indicate greater improvement and less worsening in cognitive function (such as memory, recognition, ability to speak, and other symptoms of dementia) than the average placebo-treated patient.
In a 26-week, global study, patients were divided into similar groups. Results of this study also indicated that the 6-12 mg/day group showed significantly better ratings for CIBIC-Plus than placebo, and significantly better scores on the ADAS-cog scale, compared to placebo and the 1-4 mg/day group. However, the 1-4 mg/day treatment group did not improve significantly over placebo with either assessment tool.
To date, 5,300 patients have received Exelon in clinical research studies. This is considered the largest phase III program of an Alzheimer's treatment.
","Side Effects
The following are the most common side effects of Exelon, as experienced by patients in clinical studies:
ul>
Nausea
Vomiting
Anorexia
Dyspepsia
Asthenia
Weight loss*
*26% of women, and 18% of men in the high-dose group

Pathological changes in Dementia of the Alzheimer's type involve cholinergic neuronal pathways that project from the basal forebrain to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These pathways are thought to be intricately involved in memory, attention, learning, and other cognitive processes. While the precise mechanism of rivastigmine's action unknown, it is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. If this proposed mechanism is correct, Exelon's effect may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. There is no evidence that rivastigmine alters the course of the underlying dementing process. After a 6 mg dose of rivastigmine, anticholinesterase activity is present in CSF for about 10 hours, with a maximum inhibition of about 60% five hours after dosing.

Alzheimer's disease,Exelon (rivastigmine tartrate),"General Information
Exelon (rivastigmine tartrate) is a cholinesterase inhibitor. The exact mechanism of rivastigmine's action is unknown, however it is thought to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. It inhibits the cholinesterase enzyme from breaking down acetylcholine, increasing both the level and duration of action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.
Exelon is specifically indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimerâ€™s type and for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinsonâ€™s disease.
Exelon patch is supplied as a 4.6 mg or 9.5 mg patch designed for transdermal administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 4.6 mg/24 hours. If treatment is well tolerated after a minimum of four weeks, this dose should be increased to 9.5 mg/24 hours, the recommended effective dose.
Clinical Results

Alzheimer's disease,Femstat 3 (butoconazole nitrate 2%),"General Information
Femstat 3 is an over-the-counter treatment (OTC) for vaginal yeast infections. While other OTC vaginal yeast infection medications require 7 days of treatment, Femstat 3 vaginal cream will be the first 3-day treatment brand available without a prescription.
Femstat 3 contains the antifungal agent butoconazole nitrate, which was developed specifically for the local treatment of vaginal yeast infections.
Femstat 3 should be used vaginally by nonpregnant women and girls age 12 and over.
Femstat 3 will be available in a 5-gram prefilled disposable applicator, with three applicators packaged together as a treatment regimen. Recommended dosage is one applicatorful each day for three consecutive days, preferably at bedtime.
Clinical Results
Since its introduction in prescription form in 1986, more than 13 million women worldwide have been treated with butoconazole nitrate for vaginal yeast infections. The safety of prescription butoconazole nitrate has been established in 45 clinical trials and eight years of postmarketing experience in the U.S. and abroad. These clinical studies included 3,267 subjects treated with butoconazole nitrate; 1,735 subjects treated with other antifungal agents; and 287 subjects treated with a placebo. In these 45 studies, the drug-related incidence of local adverse events, such as burning and itching, was consistent with the market leader, Monistat 7.
Two well-controlled clinical studies conducted in support of the Rx-to-OTC switch application demonstrated that the 3-day regimen with butoconazole nitrate 2% cream in over 300 subjects was as safe and effective as the 7-day regimen of miconazole nitrate 2% cream (Monistat 7) for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis when evaluated at 8 and 30 days post-treatment. The efficacy of butoconazole nitrate in a 3-day regimen was also established in clinical studies conducted in support of the original prescription product. These NDA studies included more than 1,300 subjects, nearly 900 of whom were treated with butoconazole nitrate 2% cream.
",,"Additional Information
Between 1980 and 1990, the incidence of vulvovaginal candidiasis nearly doubled in the United States., with an annual occurrence of 13 million cases. OTC vaginal yeast infection products are intended for use by women who have previously been diagnosed by a physician as having a vaginal yeast infection and who are experiencing the same symptoms again. Nonprescription Femstat 3 is the result of the prescription-to-OTC switch of the prescription products, Femstat and Femstat Prefill.
First-time sufferers should see a doctor. Femstat 3 should not be used if experiencing abdominal pain, fever, or foul-smelling discharge. A physician should be contacted immediately. If the infection isn't gone in three days, there may be a condition other than a yeast infection or the use of more medication may be needed. A doctor should be consulted. If symptoms return within two months or if women think they have been exposed to the HIV virus that causes AIDS, a doctor should be consulted immediately. Recurring infections may be a sign of pregnancy or a serious condition, such as AIDS or diabetes. Product should not be used if a woman is pregnant or thinks she may be pregnant, has diabetes, a positive HIV test or AIDS. Condoms or diaphragms should not be relied upon to prevent sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy while using this product. This product may damage condoms and diaphragms and may cause them to fail. Another method of birth control should be used to prevent pregnancy while using this product. Femstat 3 should not be used with tampons. This product should not be used in girls under 12 years of age.",
Alzheimer's disease,Namenda (memantine HCl),"General Information
Namenda (Memantine) is an oral NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist. It appears to restore the function of damaged nerve cells and reduce abnormal excitatory signals. This is accomplished by the modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity.
Namenda is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimerâ€™s type in adult patients.
The recommended starting dose of Namenda is 5 mg once daily. The recommended target dose is 20 mg/day.
The product was approved in Europe in May of 2002 for the Alzheimer's indication. There it is marketed there under the name Ebixa by Merz Pharmaceuticals.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Namenda was based on two phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies enrolling a total of 656 subjects with moderate to severe Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The average age of the study subjects was 76 ranging from 50 to 93 years old. Treatment efficacy was determined using both overall function through caregiver-related assessment, and an instrument that measures cognition. Day-to-day function was assessed in both studies using the modified Alzheimerâ€™s Disease cooperative Study --Activities of Daily Living inventory (ADCS-ADL). Results from both studies showed that that patients taking Namenda experienced significant improvement on both measures compared to placebo.
The first study enrolled 252 subjects with moderate to severe Alzheimerâ€™s disease who were administered Namenda (5 mg once daily and increased weekly by 5 mg/day) or placebo for 28-weeks. Results showed the mean difference in the ADCS-ADL change scores for Namenda compared with placebo was 3.4 units.
The second study enrolled 404 subjects with moderate to severe Alzheimerâ€™s disease who were administered Namenda (5 mg once daily and increased weekly by 5 mg/day) or placebo for 28-weeks. All Subjects had been treated with donepezil for at least 6 months and had been on a stable dose of donepezil for the last 3 months prior to the study. Results showed that the mean difference in the ADCS-ADL change scores for subjects treated with Namenda plus donepezil was 1.6 units compared with subjects treated with donepezil plus placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Namenda may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Fatigue
Pain
Hypertension
Headache
Constipation
Vomiting
Back pain
Somnolence
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Namenda or Alzheimer's disease, please contact The Namenda Web Site","Mechanism of Action
Currently, all drugs approved for the treatment of Alzheimerâ€™s in U.S. belong to a class of drugs called acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Namenda, a low to moderate affinity NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist is thought to selectively block the effects associated with abnormal transmission of the neurotransmitter glutamate, while allowing for the physiological transmission associated with normal cell functioning.
The overexcitation of NMDA receptors by the neurotransmitter glutamate may facilitate Alzheimer's disease since glutamate is found in the neural pathways associated with learning and memory. Abnormal levels of glutamate may be responsible for neuronal cell dysfunction and the eventual cell death observed in Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease,Reminyl (galantamine hydrobromide),"General Information
Reminyl is an Alzheimer's treatment derived from the bulbs of the daffodil, Narcissus pseudonarcissus. It is believed that neurons producing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine degenerate in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This loss of acetylcholine has been correlated with decreased cognitive function (thinking, remembering and reasoning). Reminyl works to increase the concentration of acetylcholine by blocking the action of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis (break down) of acetylcholine.
An estimated four million Americans have Alzheimer's disease -- a progressive loss of cognitive function so severe that it interferes with an individual's ability to function. The number is expected to grow to 14 million by the middle of the next century. The disorder is the third-most expensive illness in the United States, behind only heart disease and cancer.
Reminyl was developed by the Janssen Research Foundation under a co-development and licensing agreement with the UK-based Shire Pharmaceuticals. The drug will be marketed by Janssen Pharmaceutica and Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical in the United States.
Clinical Results
In trials ranging from 12 to 26 weeks, the effectiveness of Reminyl was measured using two primary tools. Subjects' abilities in terms of memory, orientation, reasoning and language were assessed using the cognitive portion of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). Across all trials, results demonstrated that more subjects taking Reminyl showed significant improvement in their cognitive performance than subjects taking placebo.
The second primary measure of effectiveness was the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Information (CIBIC-plus), which provides an overall assessment of patient functioning - including behavior, organized thinking and activities of daily living (such as dressing, eating and managing family finances). The CIBIC-plus results from all trials also showed that the overall scores for subjects taking Reminyl were statistically superior to placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse events reported with Reminyl use include (but are not limited to) the following:
Nausea
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Anorexia
Weight loss
The most frequent adverse events associated with the use of Reminyl can be minimized by following the recommended dosage and administration.
Because this list is not all-inclusive, please consult a physician to discuss any side effects and the individual appropriateness of the drug.
","Additional Information
Reminyl is given in a tablet formulation, with 4 mg, 8 mg or 12 mg dosages. The drug should be taken twice a day, preferably with morning and evening meals.
For more information on Reminyl, please visit Janssen Pharmaceutica.
Additional information on Alzheimer's disease can be obtained by visiting the Alzheimer's Association.","Mechanism of Action
Galantamine, a tertiary alkaloid, is a competitive and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. While the precise mechanism of galantamine's action is unknown, it may exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. If this mechanism is correct, galantamine's effect may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. (from Reminyl Prescribing Information).

Amyloidosis,Onpattro (patisiran),"General Information
Onpattro (patisiran) contains a transthyretin-directed small interfering RNA. Onpattro utilizes a novel approach to target and reduce production of the TTR protein in the liver via the RNAi pathway. Reducing the TTR protein leads to a reduction in the amyloid deposits that accumulate in tissues.
Onpattro is specifically indicated for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults.
Onpattro is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion. Dosing is based on body weight. For patients weighing less than 100 kg, the recommended dosage is 0.3 mg/kg every 3 weeks by intravenous infusion. For patients weighing 100 kg or more, the recommended dosage is 30 mg once every 3 weeks. Infuse over approximately 80 minutes. Premedicate with a corticosteroid, acetaminophen, and antihistamines to reduce the risk of infusion related reactions.
If a dose is missed, administer Onpattro as soon as possible. If Onpattro is administered within 3 days of the missed dose, continue dosing according to the patientâ€™s original schedule. If Onpattro is administered more than 3 days after the missed dose, continue dosing every 3 weeks thereafter.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Onpattro was based on the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global Phase III APOLLO study. The study enrolled 225 subjects who received intravenous Onpattro (0.3 mg per kg of body weight) or placebo once every 3 weeks for 18 months. The primary endpoint of the APOLLO study was the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7), which assesses motor strength, reflexes, sensation, nerve conduction and postural blood pressure. Patients treated with Onpattro had a mean 6.0-point decrease (improvement) in mNIS+7 score from baseline compared to a mean 28.0-point increase (worsening) for patients in the placebo group, resulting in a mean 34.0-point difference relative to placebo, after 18 months of treatment. Nearly all Onpattro-treated patients experienced a treatment benefit relative to placebo, and 56% of Onpattro-treated patients at 18 months of treatment experienced reversal of neuropathy impairment (as assessed by mNIS+7 score) relative to their own baseline, compared to four percent of patients who received placebo.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Rectiv or chronic anal fissures, please visit the Prostrakan web page.","Mechanism of Action
Rectiv is a nitroglycerin-based topical ointment. Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3â€™,5â€™-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation. The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Intra-anal application of nitroglycerin reduces sphincter tone and resting intra-anal pressure.

Amnesia,Cablivi (caplacizumab-yhdp),"General Information
Cablivi (caplacizumab-yhdp) is a von Willebrand factor (vWF)-directed antibody fragment. Caplacizumab blocks the interaction of ultralarge von Willebrand Factor (vWF) multimers with platelets and, therefore, has an immediate effect on platelet adhesion and the ensuing formation and accumulation of the micro-clots that cause the severe thrombocytopenia, tissue ischemia and organ dysfunction in aTTP.
Cablivi is specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP), in combination with plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapy.
Cablivi is supplied as an injection for intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Cablivi should be administered upon initiation of plasma exchange therapy. The recommended dose of Cablivi is as follows: First day of treatment: 11 mg bolus intravenous injection at least 15 minutes prior to plasma exchange followed by an 11 mg subcutaneous injection after completion of plasma exchange on day 1. Subsequent days of treatment during daily plasma exchange: 11 mg subcutaneous injection once daily following plasma exchange. Treatment after plasma exchange period: 11 mg subcutaneous injection once daily continuing for 30 days following the last daily plasma exchange. If after initial treatment course, sign(s) of persistent underlying disease such as suppressed ADAMTS13 activity levels remain present, treatment may be extended for a maximum of 28 days. Discontinue Cablivi if the patient experiences more than 2 recurrences of aTTP, while on Cablivi.
If a dose of Cablivi is missed during the plasma exchange period, it should be given as soon as possible. If a dose of Cablivi is missed after the plasma exchange period, it can be administered within 12 hours of the scheduled time of administration. Beyond 12 hours, the missed dose should be skipped and the next daily dose administered according to the usual dosing schedule.

In patients previously receiving epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa, the recommended starting monthly dose of Omontys should be estimated on the basis of the weekly dose of epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa at the time of substitution. See label for specific dosing levels.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Omontys was based on two randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multi-center clinical studies. The trials enrolled subjects who were being treated with another ESA (epoetin alfa or epoetin beta) at the time of study entry. The primary efficacy endpoint for each study was the change in hemoglobin from Baseline to the Evaluation Period (Weeks 29 to 36) using a non-inferiority comparison with epoetin.In Study 1, subjects received epoetin via the intravenous route of administration and continued to use this route after randomization to either Omontys or epoetin. In Study 2, the route of administration previously used for epoetin (intravenous or subcutaneous) was used. The subjects were randomized to receive Omontys once monthly, or to continue on their current ESA treatment 1 to 3 times per week. Non-inferiority was reached in both trials. A pooled analysis was also conducted evaluating a composite cardiovascular safety endpoint consisting of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or serious adverse events of congestive heart failure, unstable angina or arrhythmia. In subjects receiving Omontys, 22.8% experienced one of these events compared to 24.4% receiving epoetin.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Omontys may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Amnesia,Reblozyl (luspatercept-aamt),"General Information
Reblozyl (luspatercept-aamt) is an erythroid maturation agent.
Reblozyl is specifically indicated for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with beta thalassemia who require regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions.
Reblozyl is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous administration. The recommended starting dose of Reblozyl is 1 mg/kg once every 3 weeks by subcutaneous injection.
If a planned administration of Reblozyl is delayed or missed, administer Reblozyl as soon as possible and continue dosing as prescribed, with at least 3 weeks between doses. Assess and review hemoglobin (Hgb) results prior to each administration. If an RBC transfusion occurred prior to dosing, the pretransfusion Hgb must be considered for dosing purposes.
If the pre-dose Hgb is greater than or equal to 11.5 g/dL and the Hgb level is not influenced by recent transfusion, delay dosing until the Hgb is less than or equal to 11 g/dL.
If a patient does not achieve a reduction in RBC transfusion burden after at least 2 consecutive doses (6 weeks) at the 1 mg/kg starting dose, increase the Reblozyl dose to 1.25 mg/kg. Do not increase the dose beyond the maximum dose of 1.25 mg/kg.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Reblozyl was based on the phase 3 BELIEVE trial. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 336 patients with beta thalassemia requiring regular red blood cell transfusions (6-20 RBC units per 24 weeks) with no transfusion-free period greater than 35 days during that period who were randomized 2:1 to Reblozyl (n=224) or placebo (n=112). Reblozyl was administered subcutaneously once every 3 weeks as long as a reduction in transfusion requirement was observed or until unacceptable toxicity. All patients were eligible to receive best supportive care, which included RBC transfusions; iron-chelating agents; use of antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal therapy; and/or nutritional support, as needed. The BELIEVE trial showed a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of erythroid response, defined as at least a 33 percent cut from baseline in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion burden with a reduction of at least two units during a defined period of 12 consecutive weeks, from weeks 13 to 24, compared to placebo. The drug also met all key secondary endpoints of statistically significant improvements in RBC transfusion burden from baseline of at least 33 percent decrease during the weeks 37 to 48 period, and at least a 50 percent reduction from week 13 to week 24, at least a 50 percent decrease from weeks 37 to 48, and a mean change in transfusion burden from weeks 13 to 24.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Reblozyl may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Amnesia,Ultomiris (ravulizumab-cwvz),"General Information
Ultomiris (ravulizumab-cwvz) is a humanized monoclonal antibody.
Ultomiris is specifically indicated for the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) for adult and pediatric (one month of age and older) patients.
Ultomiris is supplied as an injection for intravenous infusion. The recommended dosing regimen in adult and pediatric patients one month of age and older with aHUS weighing 5 kg or greater, consists of a loading dose followed by maintenance dosing, administered by intravenous infusion. Administer the doses based on the patientâ€™s body weight, as shown in the table in the drug's prescription label. Starting 2 weeks after the loading dose administration, begin maintenance doses once every 8 weeks or every 4 weeks (depending on body weight). The dosing schedule is allowed to occasionally vary within 7 days of the scheduled infusion day (except for the first maintenance dose of ULTOMIRIS); but the subsequent doses should be administered according to the original schedule.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ultomiris for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) was based on data from two global, single-arm open-label studies â€“ one in adults and one in children, referred to as pediatrics in the study â€“ with aHUS. The pediatric study is ongoing and a total of 14 out of 16 children were enrolled and included in the interim analysis. Efficacy evaluation of Complete TMA Response was defined by hematologic normalization parameters (platelet count and LDH) and improved kidney function (as measured by â‰¥ 25 percent improvement in serum creatinine from baseline). In the initial 26-week treatment periods, 54 percent of adults and 71 percent (interim data) of children demonstrated Complete TMA Response. Treatment with Ultomiris resulted in reduced thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count) in 84 percent of adults and 93 percent of children, reduced hemolysis (the destruction of red blood cells) in 77 percent of adults and 86 percent of children, and improved kidney function in 59 percent of adults and 79 percent (interim data) of children (for patients on dialysis at enrollment, baseline was established after they had come off dialysis).
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions associated with the use of Ultomiris may include, but are not limited to, the following:
upper respiratory tract infection
diarrhea
nausea
vomiting
headache
hypertension
pyrexia
The Ultomiris drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning: Life-threatening meningococcal infections/sepsis have occurred in patients treated with Ultomiris and may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Comply with the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for meningococcal vaccination in patients with complement deficiencies. Immunize patients with meningococcal vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of Ultomiris, unless the risks of delaying Ultomiris therapy outweigh the risks of developing a meningococcal infection. Vaccination reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of meningococcal infection. Monitor patients for early signs of meningococcal infections, and evaluate immediately if infection is suspected. Ultomiris is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the Ultomiris REMS, prescribers must enroll in the program.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Ultomiris or aHUS, please visit the Ultomiris web page.","Mechanism of Action
Ultomiris (ravulizumab-cwvz) is a humanized monoclonal antibody. Ravulizumab-cwvz is a terminal complement inhibitor that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a (the proinflammatory anaphylatoxin) and C5b (the initiating subunit of the terminal complement complex [C5b-9]) and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b9. ULTOMIRIS inhibits terminal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis in patients with PNH and complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in patients with aHUS.

Amnesia,Venofer (iron sucrose injection),"General Information
Venofer (iron sucrose injection) is a complex of polynuclear iron (III)-hydroxide in sucrose. It is approved for use in replenishing iron in patients receiving erythropoietin (a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production) and undergoing chronic hemodialysis, which involves filtering the blood in order to remove waste products. In these patients, an iron deficiency is caused by blood loss during the dialysis procedure, increased erythropoiesis (red blood cell production), and insufficient absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract. Iron is essential for the synthesis of hemoglobin, which is responsible for the transport of oxygen throughout the body.
Clinical Results
Three trials were conducted to assess the safety and effectiveness of Venofer. Two trials were conducted in the United States and one was conducted in South Africa.
Study A was a multicenter, open-label, historically-controlled trial involving 101 hemodialysis patients (77 patients receiving Venofer and 24 patients in the historical control) with iron deficiency anemia. Venofer 5 mL (one vial) containing 100 mg of elemental iron was administered through the dialysis line at a total of 10 dialysis sessions with a cumulative dose of 1000 mg elemental iron. The mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to Day 24 (end of treatment), Day 36, and Day 57 was assessed. Patients in the Venofer treated population showed a statistically significant increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit compared to patients in the historical control population. Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation also increased significantly compared to the historical control.
Study B was a multicenter, open-label trial of Venofer involving 23 iron deficient hemodialysis patients who had been discontinued from iron dextran due to intolerance. All 23 patients were evaluated for drug effectiveness, and statistically significant increases in mean hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation were observed.
Study C was a multicenter, open-label, two period (treatment followed by observation period) trial in iron deficient hemodialysis patients. Venofer was administered in doses of 100 mg during sequential dialysis sessions until a pre-determined, calculated total dose of iron was administered. Twenty-seven patients (20%) were receiving erythropoietin treatment at trial entry, and they continued to receive the same erythropoietin dose for the duration of the trial. Significant increases from baseline in mean hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, and serum transferrin saturation were observed at week two of the observation period, and these values remained significantly increased at week four. (from FDA label)
","Side Effects
Hypotension (low blood pressure) has been frequently reported in patients receiving intravenous iron, and may be related to the rate of administration of Venofer and to the total dose received. As a result, caution should be taken to ensure that Venofer is administered as directed.
Adverse reactions noted in the three Venofer trials include the following (reported by more than 5% of the treated patients):
Hypotension (36%)
Cramps/leg cramps (23%)
Nausea
Headache
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Additionally, serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with iron carbohydrate complexes. While fatal hypersensitivity reactions have not been observed in Venofer clinical trials, physician vigilance is advised while any patient is receiving an intravenous iron product.
","Additional Information
For patient information on hemodialysis and related topics, please visit the web site of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.","Mechanism of Action
Following intravenous administration of Venofer, iron sucrose is dissociated by the reticuloendothelial system into iron and sucrose. Venofer's iron component appears to distribute mainly in the blood and to some extent in the extravascular fluid. A study evaluating Venofer containing 100 mg of iron labeled with 52Fe/59Fe in patients with iron deficiency showed that a significant amount of the administered iron distributes in the liver, spleen and bone marrow, and that the bone marrow is an iron trapping compartment and not a reversible volume of distribution.

Angina,Caduet (amlodipine/atorvastatin),"General Information
Caduet combines the drugs amlodipine (Norvasc, Lotrel) and atorvastatin (Lipitor), two widely prescribed cardiovascular medications. It's the first medicine to treat two different conditions, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
It is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, chronic stable angina and vasospastic angina (Prinzmetalâ€™s or variant angina). It is also indicated for primary dysbetalipoproteinemia, elevated serum TG levels, hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. In addition, is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce total-C, LDL-C, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
The recommened initial antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine is 5 mg once daily with a maximum dose of 10 mg once daily.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Caduet was based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling 1,600 subjects with co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia. Results showed that all combination-treatment groups of amlodipine and atorvastatin demonstrated statistically significant dose-related reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood pressure (DBP) and LDL-C compared to placebo.
Subjects received once daily treatment with eight dose combinations of amlodipine and atorvastatin (5/10, 10/10, 5/20, 10/20, 5/40, 10/40, 5/80, or 10/80mg), amlodipine alone (5 mg or 10 mg), atorvastatin alone (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg) or placebo.

Insomnia
Dizziness
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Caduet or cardiovascular disorders, please contact The Pfizer Web Site","Mechanism of Action
Amlodipine, a long acting calcium ion antagonist, is the active ingredient in Norvasc (Pfizer) and Lotrel (Novartis). Amlodipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The drug binds to dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. In addition, amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.
Atorvastatin, a HMGCoA reductase inhibitor indicated for lowering cholesterol, is the active ingredient in Lipitor (Pfizer). Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell-surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL.

Angina,Nitrostat (nitroglycerin) Tablets,"General Information
Nitrostat is an acceptable form of therapy for various circulatory disorders including angina, pulmonary hypertension, and congestive heart failure (administered as an intravenous drug). Nitrostat relaxes smooth muscle, which causes venous dilation and results in decreased stress on the heart. It also dilates the arteries leading to the heart which help to improve oxygen supply to the heart.
One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. The dose may be repeated approximately every five minutes until relief is obtained, up to a total of three tablets in a fifteen minute period. If pain persists past the fifteen minutes, a physician should be notified. These tablets may be used prophylactically five to ten minutes before engaging in activities which might precede an acute attack.
Clinical Results
Regimens in which nitroglycerin patches were worn for twelve hours daily have been studied in well-controlled trials for up to four weeks in duration. Beginning about two hours after application and continuing 10-12 hours after application, patches delivering at least 0.4 mg of nitroglycerin per hour consistently demonstrated greater antianginal activity than placebo. Low-dose patches have not been extensively studied, but in a large, well-controlled trial in which higher-dose patches were also studied, patches delivering 0.2 mg/hr had significantly less antianginal activity than placebo.
It is reasonable to believe that the rate of nitroglycerin absorption from patches may vary with the site of application, but this relationship has not been adequately studied.
","Side Effects
Side effects may include:
Facial flushing
Fast heartbeat
Dizziness
Mild headache
Nausea
More severe side effects (if you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately):
Blurred vision
Trouble breathing
Fainting or severe weakness
Headache (severe or prolonged)
Skin rash
","Additional Information
Patient Information:
When using the sublingual tablets - those placed under the tongue - you should feel a burning or tingling. This indicates the drug is effective. You should replace these tablets every six months to ensure they are effective. When using the paste or the patch, make sure to wash your hands after applying the medication to avoid getting the medication into the eyes. You may be asked to remove the patch during the night to provide a drug-free period for your body. When changing from one formulation to another, consult with your pharmacist or physician for proper dosage changes. (from RxList)
Nitrostat is available in tablets that are swallowed, tablets that are place under the tongue, a patch, and a paste that is applied to the skin
For more information regarding Coronary Artery Disease or Angina Pectoris, visit the American Heart Association.","Mechanism of Action
Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilation.

Angina,Ranexa (ranolazine),"General Information
Ranexa (ranolazine) is an orally-available, extended release anti-ischemic/anti-anginal drug, designed to act without reducing heart rate or blood pressure.
Ranexa is specifically indicated for the treatment of chronic angina in patients who have failed to respond to prior angina therapy. It is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing QT interval prolongation (see ","Side Effects section, below).
Ranexa is supplied as a film-coated extended release tablet. Recommended initial dosing is 500 mg twice daily; this may be escalated to a maximum dose of 1000 mg twice daily, based on disease response.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Approval of Ranexa was based on a pair of clinical trials, dubbed ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) and CARISA (Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina).
ERICA Study
In this placebo controlled study, 565 patients were randomized to receive a 1 week loading regimen of 500 mg Ranexa or placebo twice daily, followed by a 6 week regimen of 1000 mg Ranexa or placebo twice daily, in combination with 10 mg amlodipine once daily. Trial data showed that Ranexa significantly decreased frequency of angina attacks (mean 3.3 attacks per week, vs. 4.3 for placebo; p=0.028) and need for intervention treatment with nitroglycerin (mean 2.7 doses per week, vs. 3.6 for placebo; p=0.014). The drug was seen to have higher efficacy in male patients.
CARISA Study
This placebo controlled study enrolled 823 patients, who received one of two twice daily doses of Ranexa (750 mg or 1000 mg) or placebo, in combination with continued background therapy (50 mg atenolol, 5 mg amlodipine, or 180 mg diltiazem CD). Trial data yielded a significant increase in modified Bruce treadmill exercise tolerance (p<0.05) and time to angina onset (p<0.05) at both peak (4 hours post dose) and trough (12 hours post dose) drug plasma concentrations. Both doses significantly reduced angina frequency (750 mg: 2.5 attacks/week; 1000 mg: 2.1 attacks/week; vs. 3.3 attacks/week for placebo; p=0.006 and p<0.001, respectively) and nitroglycerin intervention (750 mg: 2.1 doses/week; 1000 mg: 1.8 doses/week; vs. 3.1 doses/week for placebo; p=0.016 and p<0.001). There was no significant difference in efficacy between the two doses of Ranexa.
Ongoing Study Commitments
The impact of renal impairment on exposure to ranolazine should be better defined. One way of achieving this would be to re-do the population pharmacokinetics of ranolazine using the entire database available including patients with renal impairment. The report of the re-analysis should be submitted to the Agency by July 27, 2006.

Angina,Toprol-XL (metoprolol succinate),"General Information
Toprol-XL is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent, for oral administration, available as extended release tablets. It has been formulated to provide a controlled and predictable release of metoprolol for once-daily administration. Hypertension The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents is not fully known. However, several possible mechanisms have been proposed: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output; (2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery; and (3) suppression of renin activity. Angina pectoris Metoprolol blocks the catecholamine-induced increases in heart rate, velocity and extent of myocardial contraction, and in blood pressure, metoprolol reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort. Heart failure Tthe precise mechanism for the beneficial effects of beta-blockers in heart failure is not known.
Toprol-XL is specifically indicated for: the treatment of hypertension, either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, the long-term treatment of angina pectoris and the treatment of stable, symptomatic (NYHA Class II or III) heart failure of ischemic, hypertensive, or cardiomyopathic origin.
Toprol-XL is supplied as 25mg, 50mg, 100mg and 200mg tablets designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is as follows:<.p>
Hypertension
25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. The dosage may be increased at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied.
Angina Pectoris
The doseage should be individualized. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in a single dose. The dosage may be gradually increased at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks.
Heart Failure
Dosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. The recommended starting dose of is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA Class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. The dose should then be doubled every two weeks to the highest dosage level tolerated, up to 200 mg.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approved of Toprol-XL was based on the following results:
Hypertension
A double-blind study enrolled 1,092 subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension who were randomized to once daily Toprol-XL (25, 100, or 400 mg), Plendil (felodipine extended release tablets), a combination of the two, or placebo. After 9 weeks, Toprol-XL alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6-8/4-7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of Toprol-XL with Plendil has greater effects on blood pressure. In controlled clinical studies, an immediate release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100-450 mg daily. Toprol-XL, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, produces similar ÃŸ1-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily. In addition, Toprol-XL administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily lowered blood pressure 24-hours post-dosing in placebo-controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, immediate release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected both supine and standing blood pressure.
Angina Pectoris
In controlled clinical trials, an immediate release formulation of metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. Toprol-XL, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess beta-blockade similar to conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.
Heart Failure
MERIT-HF was an international double-blind, placebo-controlled study and randomized 3,991 patients with NYHA Class II-IV heart failure attributable to ischemia, hypertension, or cardiomyopathy. Prior to treatment, subjects were stabilized on optimal concomitant therapy for heart failure, including diuretics, ACE inhibitors, cardiac glycosides, and nitrates. The mean duration of follow-up was one year. At the end of the study, the mean daily dose of Toprol-XL was 159 mg. The primary endpoints were (1) all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization (time to first event) and (2) all-cause mortality. The trial was terminated early for a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (34%, nominal p= 0.00009). The risk of all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization was reduced by 19% (p= 0.00012). The trial also showed improvements in heart failure-related mortality and heart failure-related hospitalizations, and NYHA functional class.

Toprol-XL is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking agent, for oral administration, available as extended release tablets. It has been formulated to provide a controlled and predictable release of metoprolol for once-daily administration. Hypertension The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents is not fully known. However, several possible mechanisms have been proposed: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output; (2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery; and (3) suppression of renin activity. Angina pectoris Metoprolol blocks the catecholamine-induced increases in heart rate, velocity and extent of myocardial contraction, and in blood pressure, metoprolol reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort. Heart failure Tthe precise mechanism for the beneficial effects of beta-blockers in heart failure is not known.

Arthritis,Arthrotec,"General Information
Arthrotec has been approved as a treatment for arthritis pain. It is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (diclofenac sodium) that is coated with misoprostol (for protection against stomach ulcer).
Clinical Results
Because of the misoprostol coating, Arthrotec is reported to carry a reduced risk of causing ulcers in the stomach and small intestine compared to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.
",,,"Mechanism of Action
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories alleviate arthritis pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins in the affected joint, but they also reduce prostaglandin synthesis in the gastrointestinal lining, leading to increased risk of ulcer formation. Misoprostol fights ulcer formation by reducing the secretion of stomach acid and boosting mucus production."

The FDA approval of Xeljanz was based on two dose-ranging trials and five confirmatory trials.
Dose-Ranging Trials:
Dose-Ranging Study 1:
This was a 6-month monotherapy trial in 384 subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to a DMARD. Subjects who previously received adalimumab therapy were excluded. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 7 monotherapy treatments: Xeljanz 1, 3, 5, 10 or 15 mg twice daily, adalimumab (ADA)40 mg subcutaneously every other week for 10 weeks followed by Xeljanz 5 mg twice daily for 3 months, or placebo. In the 10 and 15mg Xeljanz arms, 80% of subjects reached ACR20 versus 40% in the ADA and and approximately 20% in the placebo arm.
Dose-Ranging Study 2
This was a 6-month trial in which 507 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to MTX alone received one of 6 dose regimens of Xeljanz (20 mg once daily; 1, 3, 5, 10 or 15 mg twice daily), or placebo added to background MTX. Approximately 55% to 60% of subjects in the 3 through 15mg Xeljanz and ADA treatment arms reached ACR20 versus approximately 30% in the placebo arm.
Confirmatory Trials:
Study I
This was a 6-month monotherapy trial in which 610 patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to a DMARD (nonbiologic or biologic) received Xeljanz 5 or 10 mg twice daily or placebo. At the Month 3 visit, all patients randomized to placebo treatment were advanced in a blinded fashion to a second predetermined treatment of Xeljanz 5 or 10 mg twice daily. The primary endpoints at Month 3 were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response, changes in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and rates of Disease Activity Score DAS28-4(ESR) less than 2.6.
Study II
This was a 12-month trial in which 792 patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to a nonbiologic DMARD received Xeljanz 5 or 10 mg twice daily or placebo added to background DMARD treatment (excluding potent immunosuppressive treatments such as azathioprine or cyclosporine). At the Month 3 visit, nonresponding patients were advanced in a blinded fashion to a second predetermined treatment of Xeljanz 5 or 10 mg twice daily. At the end of Month 6, all placebo patients were advanced to their second predetermined treatment in a blinded fashion. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at Month 6, changes in HAQ-DI at Month 3, and rates of DAS28-4(ESR) less than 2.6 at Month 6.
Study III
This was a 12-month trial in 717 patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to MTX. Patients received Xeljanz 5 or 10 mg twice daily, adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every other week, or placebo added to background MTX. Placebo patients were advanced as in Study II. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at Month 6, HAQ-DI at Month 3, and DAS28-4(ESR) less than 2.6 at Month 6.
Study IV
This is an ongoing 2-year trial with a planned analysis at 1 year in which 797 patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to MTX received Xeljanz 5 or 10 mg twice daily or placebo added to background MTX. Placebo patients were advanced as in Study II. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at Month 6, mean change from baseline in van der Heijde-modified total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Month 6, HAQ-DI at Month 3, and DAS28-4(ESR) less than 2.6 at Month 6.
Study V
This was a 6-month trial in which 399 patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to at least one approved TNF-inhibiting biologic agent received Xeljanz 5 or 10 mg twice daily or placebo added to background MTX. At the Month 3 visit, all patients randomized to placebo treatment were advanced in a blinded fashion to a second predetermined treatment of Xeljanz 5 or 10 mg twice daily. The primary endpoints at Month 3 were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response, HAQ-DI, and DAS28-4(ESR) less than 2.6.
Overview of Results
In all trials, patients treated with either 5 or 10 mg twice daily Xeljanz had higher ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates versus placebo, with or without background DMARD treatment, at Month 3 and Month 6. Higher ACR20 response rates were observed within 2 weeks compared to placebo. In the 12-month trials, ACR response rates in Xeljanz-treated patients were consistent at 6 and 12 months. In Study IV, a greater proportion of patients treated with Xeljanz 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily plus MTX achieved a low level of disease activity as measured by a DAS28-4(ESR) less than 2.6 at 6 months compared to those treated with MTX alone. Patients receiving XELJANZ 5 and 10 mg twice daily demonstrated greater improvement from baseline in physical functioning compared to placebo at Month 3. The mean difference from placebo in HAQ-DI improvement from baseline at Month 3 in Study III was -0.22 (-0.35, -0.10) in patients receiving 5 mg Xeljanz twice daily and -0.32 (-0.44, -0.19) in patients receiving 10 mg Xeljanz twice daily. Similar results were obtained in Studies I, II, IV and V. In the 12-month trials, HAQ-DI results in Xeljanz-treated patients were consistent at 6 and 12 months.

The FDA approval of Actemra for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA) was based on CHERISH, a phase III trial. The trial consisted of an open label phase, followed by a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal phase. The study demonstrated that subjects treated with Actemra experienced clinically meaningful improvement in signs and symptoms of PJIA. A total of 91% of subjects taking Actemra plus MTX and 83% taking Actemra alone achieved an ACR 30 response at week 16 compared to baseline. In the randomized double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal phase of the trial, Actemra-treated patients experienced significantly fewer disease flares compared to placebo-treated patients (26% vs. 48%).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Actemra may include, but are not limited to, the following:
upper respiratory tract infections
nasopharyngitis
headache

Actemra is a recombinant humanized anti-human interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin IgG1 (gamma 1, kappa) subclass. Tocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes and fibroblasts. IL-6 is also produced by synovial and endothelial cells leading to local production of IL-6 in joints affected by inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Aspergillosis,Cresemba (isavuconazonium sulfate),"General Information
Cresemba (isavuconazonium sulfate) is an azole antifungal.
Cresemba is specifically indicated for patients 18 years of age and older for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis.
Cresemba is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion and as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended dose is as follows:
Cresemba injection:
Loading dose: 1 reconstituted vial (372 mga ) intravenously every 8 hours for 6 doses (48 hours)
Maintenance dose: 1 reconstituted vial (372 mga ) intravenously once daily
Cresemba capsules:
Loading dose: 2 capsules (372 mga ) orally every 8 hours for 6 doses (48 hours)
Maintenance dose: 2 capsules (372 mga ) orally once daily
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Cresemba was based on the following trials:
Invasive Aspergillus
Trial 1 was a randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority active controlled trial which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Cresemba versus voriconazole for primary treatment of invasive fungal disease caused by Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi. Patients randomized to receive Cresemba treatment were administered a loading dose intravenously of 372 mg of isavuconazonium sulfate (equivalent to 200 mg of isavuconzole) every 8 hours for the first 48 hours. Beginning on day 3, patients received intravenous or oral therapy of 372 mg of isavuconazonium sulfate (equivalent to 200 mg of isavuconazole) once daily. Patients randomized to receive voriconazole treatment were administered voriconazole intravenously with a loading dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours for the first 24 hours followed by 4 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours for the following 24 hours. Therapy could then be switched to an oral formulation of voriconazole at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours. In this trial, the protocol-defined maximum treatment duration was 84 days. Mean treatment duration was 47 days for both treatment groups, of which 8 to 9 days was by an intravenous route of administration. All-cause mortality through Day 42 in the overall population (ITT) was 18.6% in the Cresemba treatment group and 20.2% in the voriconazole treatment group for an adjusted treatment difference of -1.0% with 95% confidence interval of -8.0% to 5.9%. Similar results were seen in patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis confirmed by serology, culture or histology.
Invasive Mucormycosis
This open-label non-comparative trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of a subset of patients with invasive mucormycosis. Thirty-seven (37) patients had proven or probable mucormycosis. Patients were treated with Cresemba intravenously or via oral administration at the recommended doses. Median treatment duration was 102 days for patients classified as primary, 33 days for refractory, and 85 days for intolerant. The trial compared treatment with Cresemba with the natural disease progression associated with untreated mucormycosis. Cresemba was safe and effective. However, the efficacy of Cresemba for the treatment for invasive mucormycosis has not been evaluated in concurrent, controlled clinical trials.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Cresemba may include, but are not limited to, the following:
nausea
vomiting
diarrhea
headache
abnormal liver blood tests
hypokalemia
constipation
dyspnea
coughing
peripheral edema
Cresemba may also cause serious side effects including liver problems, infusion reactions and severe allergic and skin reactions.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Cresemba or invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis, please visit https://www.cresemba.com/","Mechanism of Action
Cresemba (isavuconazonium sulfate) is the prodrug of isavuconazole, an azole antifungal drug. Isavuconazole inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. An accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the fungal cell membrane weakens the membrane structure and function. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to isavuconazole inhibition.

Clinical Results
The FDA approval of Advair HFA Inhalation aerosol was based on the following studies:
Studies Comparing Advair HFA With Fluticasone Propionate Alone or Salmeterol Alone: Four double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials were conducted with comparing ADVAIR HFA to each individual component. The trials enrolled 1,517 adolescent and adult patients with asthma that was not optimally controlled on their current therapy. All metered-dose inhaler treatments were inhalation aerosols given as 2 inhalations twice daily. Study 1: Clinical Trial With ADVAIR HFA 45/21 Inhalation Aerosol: This placebo-controlled, 12-week, US study compared ADVAIR HFA 45/21 with fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol 44 mcg or salmeterol CFC inhalation aerosol 21 mcg, each given as 2 inhalations twice daily. The primary efficacy endpoints were predose FEV1 and withdrawals due to worsening asthma. This study was stratified according to baseline asthma therapy. Baseline FEV1 measurements were similar across treatments: ADVAIR HFA 45/21, 2.29 L; fluticasone propionate 44 mcg, 2.20 L; salmeterol, 2.33 L; and placebo, 2.27 L. Statistically significantly fewer patients receiving ADVAIR HFA 45/21 were withdrawn due to worsening asthma compared with salmeterol and placebo. Fewer patients receiving ADVAIR HFA 45/21 were withdrawn due to worsening asthma compared with fluticasone propionate 44 mcg; however, the difference was not statistically significant. In addition, subjects receiving ADVAIR HFA 45/21 had significantly greater improvements in FEV1 (0.58 L, 27%) compared with fluticasone propionate 44 mcg (0.36 L, 18%), salmeterol (0.25 L, 12%), and placebo (0.14 L, 5%). These improvements in FEV1 with ADVAIR HFA 45/21 were achieved regardless of baseline asthma therapy. Study 2: Clinical Trial With ADVAIR HFA 45/21 Inhalation Aerosol:This active-controlled, 12-week, US study compared ADVAIR HFA 45/21 with fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol 44 mcg and salmeterol CFC inhalation aerosol 21 mcg, each given as 2 inhalations twice daily, in 283 patients using as-needed albuterol alone. The primary efficacy endpoint was predose FEV1. Efficacy results were similar to those observed in Study 1. Patients receiving ADVAIR HFA 45/21 had significantly greater improvements in FEV1 (0.69 L, 33%) compared with fluticasone propionate 44 mcg (0.51 L, 25%) and salmeterol (0.47 L, 22%). Study 3: Clinical Trial With ADVAIR HFA 115/21 Inhalation Aerosol: This placebo-controlled, 12-week, US study compared ADVAIR HFA 115/21 with fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol 110 mcg or salmeterol CFC inhalation aerosol 21 mcg, each given as 2 inhalations twice daily, in 365 patients using inhaled corticosteroids. The primary efficacy endpoints were predose FEV1 and withdrawals due to worsening asthma. Patients receiving ADVAIR HFA 115/21 had significantly greater improvements in FEV1 (0.41 L, 20%) compared with fluticasone propionate 110 mcg (0.19 L, 9%), salmeterol (0.15 L, 8%), and placebo (-0.12 L, -6%). Significantly fewer patients receiving ADVAIR HFA 115/21 were withdrawn from this study for worsening asthma (7%) compared with salmeterol (24%) and placebo (54%). Fewer patients receiving ADVAIR HFA 115/21 were withdrawn due to worsening asthma (7%) compared with fluticasone propionate 110 mcg (11%); however, the difference was not statistically significant. Study 4: Clinical Trial With ADVAIR HFA 230/21 Inhalation Aerosol: This active-controlled, 12-week, non-US study compared ADVAIR HFA 230/21 with fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol 220 mcg, each given as 2 inhalations twice daily, and with ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 given as 1 inhalation twice daily in 509 patients using inhaled corticosteroids. The primary efficacy endpoint was morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF). Morning PEF improved significantly with ADVAIR HFA 230/21 compared with fluticasone propionate 220 mcg over the 12-week treatment period.
The FDA approval of Advair Diskus was based on the following studies:
Asthma
Adults and Adolescents Aged 12 Years and Older:
Studies Comparing ADVAIR DISKUS to Fluticasone Propionate Alone or Salmeterol Alone: Three double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials were conducted with ADVAIR DISKUS in 1,208 adults and adolescents ( = 12 years) with asthma that was not optimally controlled on their current therapy. All treatments were inhalation powders given as 1 inhalation from the DISKUS device twice daily, and other maintenance therapies were discontinued.
Study One: This placebo-controlled, 12-week, US study compared ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 with its individual components, fluticasone propionate 100 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg. The study was stratified according to baseline asthma maintenance therapy; patients were using either inhaled corticosteroids (N = 250) or salmeterol (N = 106). Statistically significantly fewer patients receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 were withdrawn due to worsening asthma compared with fluticasone propionate, salmeterol, and placebo. Because this trial used predetermined criteria for worsening asthma, which caused more patients in the placebo group to be withdrawn, FEV1 results at Endpoint (last available FEV1 result) are also provided. Patients receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 had significantly greater improvements in FEV1 (0.51 L, 25%) compared with fluticasone propionate 100 mcg (0.28 L, 15%), salmeterol (0.11 L, 5%), and placebo (0.01 L, 1%). These improvements in FEV1 with ADVAIR DISKUS were achieved regardless of baseline asthma maintenance therapy (inhaled corticosteroids or salmeterol).
Study Two: This placebo-controlled, 12-week, US study compared ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 with its individual components, fluticasone propionate 250 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg, in 349 patients with asthma using inhaled corticosteroids. Patients receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 had significantly greater improvements in FEV1 (0.48 L, 23%) compared with fluticasone propionate 250 mcg (0.25 L, 13%), salmeterol (0.05 L, 4%), and placebo (decrease of 0.11 L, decrease of 5%). Statistically significantly fewer patients receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 were withdrawn from this study for worsening asthma (4%) compared with fluticasone propionate (22%), salmeterol (38%), and placebo (62%). In addition, ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 was superior to fluticasone propionate, salmeterol, and placebo for improvements in morning and evening PEF. Patients receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 also had clinically meaningful improvements in overall asthma-specific quality of life.
Study Three:
This 28-week, non-US study compared ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 with fluticasone propionate 500 mcg alone and concurrent therapy (salmeterol 50 mcg plus fluticasone propionate 500 mcg administered from separate inhalers) twice daily in 503 patients with asthma using inhaled corticosteroids. The primary efficacy parameter, morning PEF, was collected daily for the first 12 weeks of the study. The primary purpose of weeks 13 to 28 was to collect safety data. Baseline PEF measurements were similar across treatments: ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50, 359 L/min; fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, 351 L/min; and concurrent therapy, 345 L/min. Morning PEF improved significantly with ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 compared with fluticasone propionate 500 mcg over the 12-week treatment period. Improvements in morning PEF observed with ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 were similar to improvements observed with concurrent therapy.
Onset of Action and Progression of Improvement in Asthma Control: The onset of action and progression of improvement in asthma control were evaluated in the two placebo-controlled US trials. Following the first dose, the median time to onset of clinically significant bronchodilatation ( = 15% improvement in FEV1 ) in most patients was seen within 30 to 60 minutes. Maximum improvement in FEV1 generally occurred within 3 hours, and clinically significant improvement was maintained for 12 hours. Following the initial dose, predose FEV1 relative to Day 1 baseline improved markedly over the first week of treatment and continued to improve over the 12 weeks of treatment in both studies. Reduction in asthma symptoms, use of rescue VENTOLIN Inhalation Aerosol, and improvement in morning and evening PEF also occurred within the first day of treatment with ADVAIR DISKUS, and continued to improve over the 12 weeks of therapy in both studies.
Pediatric Patients:
In a 12-week US study, ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 twice daily was compared with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 100 mcg twice daily in 203 children with asthma aged 4 to 11 years. At study entry, the children were symptomatic on low doses of inhaled corticosteroids. The primary objective was to determine the safety of ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 compared with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 100 mcg in this age-group; however, the study also included secondary efficacy measures of pulmonary function. In patients receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50, FEV1 increased from 1.70 L at baseline (N = 79) to 1.88 L at Endpoint (N = 69) compared with an increase from 1.65 L at baseline (N = 83) to 1.77 L at Endpoint (N = 75) in patients receiving fluticasone propionate 100 mcg.
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease:
The efficacy of ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 and ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 in the treatment of patients with COPD was evaluated in 6 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials in adult patients aged 40 years and older. These trials were primarily designed to evaluate the efficacy of ADVAIR DISKUS on lung function (3 trials), exacerbations (2 trials), and survival (1 trial).
Lung Function:
Trials One and Two:
These randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 24-week trials were primarily designed to evaluate the efficacy of ADVAIR DISKUS on lung function in 1,414 patients with COPD associated with chronic bronchitis. One trial evaluated the efficacy of ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 compared with its components fluticasone propionate 250 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg and with placebo, and the other trial evaluated the efficacy of ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 compared with its components fluticasone propionate 500 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg and with placebo. Study treatments were inhalation powders given as 1 inhalation from the DISKUS device twice daily. Maintenance COPD therapies were discontinued. Improvements in lung function (as defined by predose and postdose FEV1 ) were significantly greater with ADVAIR DISKUS than with fluticasone propionate, salmeterol, or placebo. The improvement in lung function with ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 was similar to the improvement seen with ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50. Patients receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 had significantly greater improvements in predose FEV1 at Endpoint (165 mL, 17%) compared with salmeterol 50 mcg (91 mL, 9%) and placebo (1 mL, 1%), demonstrating the contribution of fluticasone propionate to the improvement in lung function with ADVAIR DISKUS. Patients receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 had significantly greater improvements in postdose FEV1 at Endpoint (281 mL, 27%) compared with fluticasone propionate 250 mcg (147 mL, 14%) and placebo (58 mL, 6%), demonstrating the contribution of salmeterol to the improvement in lung function with ADVAIR DISKUS.
Trial Three:
This 1-year study evaluated ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50, fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, salmeterol 50 mcg, and placebo in 1,465 patients. The patients had an established history of COPD and exacerbations, a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 < 70% of predicted at study entry, and 8.3% reversibility. The primary endpoint was the comparison of pre-bronchodilator FEV1 in the groups receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 or placebo. Patients treated with ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 had greater improvements in FEV1 (113 mL, 10%) compared with fluticasone propionate 500 mcg (7 mL, 2%), salmeterol (15 mL, 2%), and placebo (-60 mL, -3%).
Exacerbations:
ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50: Two studies were primarily designed to evaluate the effect of ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 on exacerbations. In these two studies, exacerbations were defined as worsening of two or more major symptoms or worsening of any 1 major symptom together with any 1 minor symptom. These two trials were identical studies designed to evaluate the effect of ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 and salmeterol 50 mcg, each given twice daily, on exacerbations of COPD over a 12-month period. A total of 1,579 patients with an established history of COPD were enrolled. All patients were treated with ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 twice daily during a 4-week run-in period prior to being assigned study treatment with twice-daily ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 or salmeterol 50 mcg. In both studies, treatment with ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 resulted in a significantly lower annual rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations compared with salmeterol (30.5% reduction, p < 0.001) in the first study and (30.4% reduction, p < 0.001) in the second study. Patients treated with ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 also had a significantly lower annual rate of exacerbations requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids compared with patients treated with salmeterol (39.7% reduction, p < 0.001) in the first study, and (34.3% reduction, p < 0.001) in the second study. Secondary endpoints including pulmonary function and symptom scores improved more in patients treated with ADVAIR DISKUS 250/50 than with salmeterol 50 mcg in both studies.
ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50: Exacerbations were also evaluated as a secondary outcome in the 1- and 3-year trials with ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50. There was not a symptomatic definition of exacerbation in these 2 trials. Exacerbations were defined in terms of severity requiring treatment with antibiotics and/or systemic corticosteroids. In the 1-year trial, the group receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 had a significantly lower rate of moderate and severe exacerbations compared with placebo (25.4% reduction compared with placebo) but not when compared with its components (7.5% reduction compared with fluticasone propionate and 7% reduction compared with salmeterol). In the 3-year trial, the group receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 had a significantly lower rate of moderate and severe exacerbations compared with each of the other treatment groups (25.1% reduction compared with placebo, 9.0% reduction compared with fluticasone propionate and 12.2% reduction compared with salmeterol ).
Survival:
A 3-year multicenter, international study evaluated the efficacy of ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 compared with fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, salmeterol 50 mcg, and placebo on survival in 6,112 patients with COPD. During the study patients were permitted usual COPD therapy with the exception of other inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators. Each patient who withdrew from double-blind treatment for any reason was followed for the full 3-year study period to determine survival status. The primary efficacy endpoint was all-cause mortality. Survival with ADVAIR DISKUS 500/50 was not significantly improved compared with placebo, or the individual components (all-cause mortality rate 12.6% ADVAIR DISKUS vs. 15.2% placebo). The rates for all-cause mortality were 13.5% and 16.0% in the groups treated with salmeterol 50 mcg and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, respectively.

nausea and vomiting
Advair HFA/Diskus comes with a boxed warning. Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA), such as salmeterol, one of the active ingredients, increase the risk of asthma-related death. Therefore, when treating patients with asthma, physicians should only prescribe Advair for patients not adequately controlled on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid, or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a LABA. Once asthma control is achieved and maintained, assess the patient at regular intervals and step down therapy if possible without loss of asthma control and maintain the patient on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid. Do not use ADVAIR for patients whose asthma is adequately controlled on low- or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids.

FDA Approval
FDA approval of Alvesco was based on the results of six randomized double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group clinical trials in adult and adolescent subjects 12 years of age and older with mild persistent to severe persistent asthma. The primary efficacy endpoint in four of the six trials was the mean change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 at endpoint (last observation). FEV1 was measured prior to the morning dose of study medication (at the end of the 24-hour dosing interval for once daily administration, and at the end of the 12-hour dosing interval for twice daily administration). In one of the six trials, the primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the average of the pre-dose FEV1 at Weeks 12 and 16, and in another trial, reduction of oral corticosteroid use was the primary efficacy endpoint. The results are as follows:
Patients Previously Maintained on Bronchodilators Alone
This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial enrolled 691 subjects with a mean baseline percent predicted FEV1 of 72%. The subjects Alvesco 160 mcg once daily in the morning for 16 weeks, Alvesco 80 mcg twice daily for 16 weeks, or Alvesco 80 mcg twice daily for 4 weeks followed by Alvesco 160 mcg once daily in the morning for 12 weeks or placebo for 16 weeks. All Alvesco doses showed statistically significant improvement over placebo at week 16 in AM pre-dose FEV1. However, the increase in the Alvesco 80 mcg twice daily arm was significantly greater than that observed in the Alvesco 160 mcg administered once daily arm. Compared to placebo, increases in AM pre-dose FEV1 were 0.12 L or 5.0 % for Alvesco 160 mcg once daily, 0.24 L or 10.4 % for Alvesco 80 mcg twice daily, 0.13 L or 5.0 % for Alvesco 80 mcg twice daily for 4 weeks followed by Alvesco 160 mcg once daily. Other measures of asthma control, AM PEF and need for rescue albuterol also improved in all the Alvesco treatment groups compared to placebo but the improvement was greatest with the Alvesco 80 mcg twice daily treatment arm.
Patients Previously Maintained on Inhaled Corticosteroids
Nycomed conducted two randomized-double blind placebo controlled trials each of 12-weeks treatment duration. In the first trial subjects with mean baseline percent predicted FEV1 of 79% received Alvesco 160 mcg once daily in the morning, ALVESCO 80 mcg twice daily or placebo. Statistically significantly more increases in AM pre-dose FEV1 compared to placebo were seen at 12 weeks for Alvesco 160 mcg once daily (0.14 L or 5.7%) and Alvesco 80 mcg twice daily (0.19 L or 7.5%). Asthma symptoms scores, AM PEF, and decreased need for rescue albuterol remained relatively stable in the Alvesco treatment groups compared to slight worsening in the placebo group.
In the second trial, 257 subjects with mean baseline percent predicted FEV1 of 54% were treated with Alvesco 160 or 320 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks. Compared to placebo, both Alvesco doses showed statistically significantly more improvement in pre-dose FEV1 (0.11 L or 8.6% and 0.18 L or 11.8%). Other measures of asthma control, AM PEF, symptoms, and need for rescue albuterol also showed improvement compared to placebo.
Patients Previously Maintained on Oral Corticosteroids:
This 12-week, double-blind clinical trial enrolled 140 subjects with mean FEV1 at baseline 53% predicted. The subjects were randomized to Alvesco given by inhalation aerosol at doses of 320 or 640 mcg twice daily or placebo. The average corticosteroid (prednisone) dose at baseline was approximately 12 mg/day. Compared to patients on placebo whose prednisone requirements increased by 4%, those treated with Alvesco 320 mcg and 640 mcg twice daily significantly reduced their prednisone requirements by 47% and 62% respectively. Those on Alvesco also maintained asthma control as reflected by lung function, symptoms, and need for rescue albuterol. A significantly larger percentage of patients on Alvesco were able to reduce oral prednisone use by 50% or more as compared to placebo (64% and 77% of the patients treated with 320 mcg and 640 mcg respectively twice daily as compared with 33% of patients on placebo).

Asthma,Arnuity Ellipta (fluticasone furoate inhalation powder),"General Information
Arnuity Ellipta contains the active component fluticasone furoate, a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity.
Arnuity Ellipta is specifically indicated for the once-daily maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy in patients aged 12 years and older. Arnuity Ellipta is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.
Arnuity Ellipta is supplied as a powder for oral inhalation. Arnuity Ellipta should be administered as 1 inhalation once daily by the orally inhaled route. Arnuity Ellipta should be used at the same time every day. Do not use more than 1 time every 24 hours. The starting dosage is based upon patientsâ€™ asthma severity. The usual recommended starting dose for patients not on an inhaled corticosteroid is 100 mcg. For other patients, the starting dose should be based on previous asthma drug therapy and disease severity. For patients who do not respond to Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg after 2 weeks of therapy, replacement with Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg may provide additional asthma control. The highest recommended daily dose is 200 mcg.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Arnuity Ellipta was based on four confirmatory trials of 3 and 6 monthsâ€™ duration and three dose-ranging trials of 8 weeksâ€™ duration in 3,611 subjects with asthma.
Dose-ranging trials
Eight doses of fluticasone furoate ranging from 25 to 800 mcg once daily were evaluated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week trials in subjects with asthma. Across the 3 trials, subjects were uncontrolled at baseline on treatments of short-acting beta2-agonist and/or non-inhaled corticosteroid controller medications (Trial 687), low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (Trial 685), or medium doses of inhaled corticosteroid (Trial 684). A dose-related increase in trough FEV1 at Week 8 was seen for doses from 25 to 200 mcg with no consistent additional benefit for doses above 200 mcg. To evaluate dosing frequency, a separate trial compared fluticasone furoate 200 mcg once daily, fluticasone furoate 100 mcg twice daily, fluticasone propionate 100 mcg twice daily, and fluticasone propionate 200 mcg once daily. The results supported the the selection of the once-daily dosing frequency.
Confirmatory Trials
Four confirmatory trials were conducted in adolescent and adult subjects aged 12 years and older with asthma. The trials were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Arnuity Ellipta given once daily in the evening on lung function in subjects who were not controlled on their current treatments of inhaled corticosteroids, or combination therapy consisting of an inhaled corticosteroid plus a LABA. Study treatments were delivered as inhalation powders. The primary endpoint in all trials was change from baseline in evening trough FEV1 measured approximately 24 hours after the final dose of study medication. Trials 2 and 4 had a co=primary endpoint of change from baseline in weighted mean serial FEV1 measured after the final dose of study medication at 5, 15, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 16, 20, 23, and 24 hours post-dose.
Trial 1: Trial 1 was a 24-week trial that evaluated the efficacy of Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg compared with placebo on lung function in subjects with asthma. Inhaled fluticasone propionate 250 mcg twice daily was given as a control. Of the 343 enrolled subjects 35% of subjects on placebo and 19% of subjects on Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg failed to complete the 24-week trial. The mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 was greater among subjects receiving Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg than among those receiving placebo (mean treatment difference from placebo 146 mL; 95% CI: 36, 257.
Trial 2: Trial 2 was a 12-week trial that evaluated the efficacy of Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg on lung function in subjects with asthma compared with placebo. The combination of fluticasone furoate 100 mcg and vilanterol 25 mcg was also included as a treatment arm. Of the 609 enrolled subjects, 26% of subjects on placebo and 10% of subjects on Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg failed to complete the 12-week trial. Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg once daily had greater mean changes from baseline in trough FEV1 than placebo throughout the trial. At Week 12 or the last available on-treatment visit prior to Week 12, the mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 was greater among subjects receiving Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg once daily than among those receiving placebo (mean treatment difference 136 mL; 95% CI: 51, 222). Lung function improvements were sustained over the 24-hour period following the final dose of Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg. Compared with placebo, at Week 12 the change from baseline in weighted mean FEV1 was significantly greater for Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg (mean treatment difference 186 mL; 95% CI: 62, 310).
Subjects in both Trials 1 and 2 receiving Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg once daily had a greater improvement from baseline in percentage of 24-hour periods without need of beta2-agonist rescue medication use than subjects receiving placebo.
Trial 3: Trial 3 was a 24-week trial that evaluated the relative efficacy of Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg and Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg on lung function in subjects with asthma. Of the 219 enrolled subjects, 16% on Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg and 13% of subjects on Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg failed to complete the 24-week trial. There were trends toward greater mean changes from baseline in the group receiving Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg than the group receiving Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg throughout the trial. At Week 24 or the last available on-treatment visit prior to Week 24, the mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 was 208 mL for Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg, as compared to 284 mL for Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg (difference of 77 mL; 95% CI: -39, 192).
Trial 4: Trial 4 was a 24-week trial that evaluated the efficacy of Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg once daily and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily on lung function in 586 subjects with asthma. Both Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg once daily and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily produced improvement from baseline in lung function. At Week 24 the mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 was 201 mL for Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg once daily and 183 mL for fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily (treatment difference of 18 mL, 95% CI: -66, 102). Lung function improvements were sustained over the 24-hour period following the final dose of Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg. At Week 24, the change from baseline in weighted mean FEV1 was 328 mL for Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg once daily and 258 mL for fluticasone propionate 500 twice daily (difference of 70 mL; 95% CI: -67, 208).

Arnuity Ellipta contains the active component fluticasone furoate, a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. The precise mechanism of corticosteroid action on asthma is not known. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma.

Asthma,Azmacort (triamcinolone acetonide) Inhalation Aerosol,"General Information
Azmacort (triamcinolone acetonide) Inhalation Aerosol has been approved as a prophylactic therapy in the maintenance treatment of asthma with twice-daily dosing. Azmacort, the most widely prescribed inhaled bronchial steroid in the United States, was previously indicated for subjects who require chronic treatment for the control of bronchial asthma symptoms with a recommended dosage of two inhalations three to four times a day. The new prophylactic indication was received in conjunction with a recent class labeling change requested by the FDA.
The only inhaled anti-inflammatory with a built-in spacer--a device, which extends the space between the opening of the metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and the subjectâ€™s mouth--Azmacort is designed to enhance therapy and compliance. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends use of spacers, as they may reduce the potential for side effects in the mouth and throat and minimize coordination problems between actuation and inhalation.
Clinical Results
The safety and efficacy of Azmacort given twice daily were demonstrated in two, six-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 222 people with chronic asthma. Results of both studies demonstrated that treatment with Azmacort (400mcg twice daily) resulted in significant improvement in lung function and asthma symptoms such as wheezing and cough, as well as a decrease in bronchodilator use. Bronchodilators are medications commonly used to rescue asthma subjects once they feel an asthma attack is about to occur.
","Side Effects
In clinical trials with Azmacort, the most commonly reported side effects were pharyngitis, hoarseness, dry and irritated throat, and dry mouth. As with all inhaled bronchial steroids, adrenal insufficiency may occur when transferring subjects from systemic steroids.
","Additional Information
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects 12 -15 million Americans--including 4.8 million children--and morbidity and mortality continue to rise. Asthma accounts for an estimated three million lost work days annually, and is the number one cause of absenteeism from school and hospitalization among children.

Dulera is specifically indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older.
Dulera is supplied as as an inhalation aerosal. The recommended starting dosages for Dulera treatment are based on prior asthma therapy.
Previous Therapy: Inhaled medium dose corticosteroids Recommended Dose: 100 mcg/5 mcg, 2 inhalations twice daily Maximum Recommended Daily Dose: 400 mcg/20 mcg
Previous Therapy: Inhaled high dose corticosteroids Recommended Dose: 200 mcg/5 mcg, 2 inhalations twice daily Maximum Recommended Daily Dose: 800 mcg/20 mcg
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Dulera was partially based on two randomized clinical trials (Trial 1, Trial 2). These trials enrolled a total of 1,509 patients 12 years of age and older with persistent asthma uncontrolled on medium or high dose inhaled corticosteroids. These studies included a 2 to 3-week run-in period with mometasone furoate to establish a certain level of asthma control. Trial 1 compared Dulera 100 mcg/5 mcg to its individual components, mometasone furoate 100 mcg and formoterol 5 mcg, and placebo). Trial 2 compared Dulera 200 mcg/5 mcg with Dulera 100 mcg/5 mcg and mometasone furoate 200 mcg. All medications were given as two inhalations twice daily by metered dose inhalers. In both trials Dulera resulted in significant improvement from baseline in lung function (mean area under the concentration-time curve for forced expiratory volume in 1 second, measured from 0 to 12 hours [FEV1 AUC0-12h]) at week 12, a primary efficacy endpoint, compared to mometasone furoate (Trial 1 and 2) and placebo (Trial 1). In Trial 1, these differences were maintained through week 26. The change in mean trough FEV1 from baseline to week 12 was assessed as another endpoint in both trials. In Trial 1, a significantly greater increase in the mean trough FEV1 was observed for Dulera 100 mcg/5 mcg compared to formoterol 5 mcg (the primary treatment comparison) as well as to placebo.

Asthma,Dupixent (dupilumab),"General Information
Dupixent (dupilumab) inhibits the overactive signaling of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), two key proteins that contribute to the inflammation associated with moderate-to-severe asthma.
Dupixent is specifically indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged 12 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma.
Dupixent is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous administration. The recommended dose of Dupixent for adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) is:
â€¢ an initial dose of 400 mg (two 200 mg injections) followed by 200 mg given every other week or
â€¢ an initial dose of 600 mg (two 300 mg injections) followed by 300 mg given every other week
For patients with oral corticosteroids-dependent asthma, start with an initial dose of 600 mg followed by 300 mg given every other week
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Dupixent for moderate-to-severe asthma was based on three randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (Trial 1, Trial 2 and Trial 3) which evaluated 2,888 adult and adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe asthma for six months to one year (24 to 52 weeks). All trials enrolled patients irrespective of minimum baseline eosinophil levels.
Trial 1 was a 24-week dose-ranging study which included 776 subjects (18 years of age and older). Dupixent compared with placebo was evaluated in adult subjects with moderate to severe asthma on a medium or high-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long acting beta agonist. Subjects were randomized to receive either 200 mg (N=150) or 300 mg (N=157) Dupixent every other week (Q2W) or 200 mg (N=154) or 300 mg (N=157) Dupixent every 4 weeks following an initial dose of 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo (N=158), respectively. The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline to Week 12 in FEV1 (L) in subjects with baseline blood eosinophils â‰¥300 cells/mcL. In the subgroup with at least 300 eosinophils per Î¼L, the greatest increases (200 mg every 2 weeks, p=0Â·0008; 300 mg every 2 weeks, p=0Â·0063) in FEV 1 compared with placebo were observed at week 12 with doses every 2 weeks in the 300 mg group (mean change 0Â·39 L) and in the 200 mg group (mean change 0Â·43 L) compared with placebo (0Â·18 L).
Trial 2 was a 52-week study which included 1,902 subjects (12 years of age and older). Dupixent compared with placebo was evaluated in 107 adolescent and 1,795 adult subjects with moderate-to-severe asthma on a medium or high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a minimum of one and up to two additional controller medications. Subjects were randomized to receive either 200 mg (N=631) or 300 mg (N=633) Dupixent Q2W (or matching placebo for either 200 mg [N=317] or 300 mg [N=321] Q2W) following an initial dose of 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo respectively. The primary endpoints were the annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52-week placebo controlled period and change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12 in the overall population (unrestricted by minimum baseline blood eosinophils count). Dupixent reduced exacerbations and improved lung function in the overall population. Benefits in exacerbations were seen in patients with eosinophil counts greater than or equal to 150 cells/microliter, which represented 70% of the patients enrolled. Efficacy improved in patients with higher eosinophil counts. For example, in patients with blood eosinophils of 300 cells/microliter or greater, Dupixent reduced severe exacerbations by 67% compared to placebo, and improved FEV1 (lung function) by 29%-33% compared to 14%-16% for placebo. In patients with eosinophil counts less than 150 cells/microliter, there was no difference in severe exacerbation rates for Dupixent versus placebo.
Trial 3 was a 24-week oral corticosteroid-reduction study in 210 subjects with asthma who required daily oral corticosteroids in addition to regular use of high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller. After optimizing the OCS dose during the screening period, subjects received 300 mg Dupixent (N=103) or placebo (N=107) once Q2W for 24 weeks following an initial dose of 600 mg or placebo. Subjects continued to receive their existing asthma medicine during the study; however their OCS dose was reduced every 4 weeks during the OCS reduction phase (Week 4-20), as long as asthma control was maintained. The primary endpoint was the percent reduction of oral corticosteroid dose at Weeks 20 to 24 compared with the baseline dose, while maintaining asthma control in the overall population (unrestricted by minimum baseline blood eosinophils count). Dupixent reduced average daily oral corticosteroid use by 70% compared to 42% with placebo. More than half of patients treated with Dupixent completely eliminated use of oral corticosteroids. Effects on lung function and on oral steroid and exacerbation reduction were similar for Dupixent irrespective of baseline blood eosinophil levels.

Dupixent (dupilumab) is a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling by speciï¬�cally binding to the IL-4RÎ± subunit shared by the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes. Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor. Inï¬‚ammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma and atopic dermatitis. Multiple cell types that express IL-4RÎ± (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, goblet cells) and inï¬‚ammatory mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines, chemokines) are involved in inï¬‚ammation. Blocking IL-4RÎ± with dupilumab inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine-induced inï¬‚ammatory responses, including the release of proinï¬‚ammatory cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide, and IgE; however, the mechanism of dupilumab action in asthma has not been deï¬�nitively established.

Asthma,Foradil Aerolizer (formoterol fumarate inhalation powder),"General Information
Foradil is a bronchodilator that belongs to the long-acting beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist class of compounds. Novartis' Foradil Aerolizer was approved in February 2001 for the maintenance treatment of asthma and the prevention of bronchospasm in reversible obstructive airways disease. Foradil is also indicated for the acute prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB), when administered on an occasional, as needed basis.
In September 2001, a second FDA approval was obtained - the Foradil Aerolizer can now be used for long term administration in the maintenance treatment of bronchoconstriction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
Foradil is administered via a dry powder inhaler called the Aerolizer, which unlike traditional metered-dose inhalers, provides patients with the reassurance that they are in control of dosing. The Aerolizer offers patients little resistance to inhalation, and produces a whirring noise which signals that the drug is being inhaled. Patients can taste the powder and then open the device to check that they have inhaled all of the dose.
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that affects 15 million Americans. According to the World Health Organization, each year 180,000 people die from asthma worldwide. The disease is characterized by shortness of breath, wheezing, tightness in the chest, and a cough that lasts more than a week.
COPD is a common chronic lung disease and a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with 2.25 million deaths a year. By 2025, the World Health Organization estimates that COPD will be the third leading cause of death globally. Since both asthma and COPD are chronic conditions, the goal of treatment is management and improvement of quality of life, rather than cure.
Clinical Results
The effectiveness of Foradil as a treatment for asthma was evaluated in five key trials involving more than 7,000 subjects, including over 1,600 mild to moderate asthmatics. In these placebo-controlled trials, Foradil was administered in 12 and 24 mcg twice daily doses.
Overall, these studies demonstrated both dosages of Foradil to be significantly better than placebo at improving lung function and quality of life in asthmatic subjects. Foradil provided subjects with clinically significant bronchodilation for a 12 hour period.
Clinical trials were also conducted to compare Foradil to the compound ipratropium bromide in subjects with COPD. Results showed that Foradil was significantly superior at reducing clinical symptoms and improving quality of life scores.
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions to treatment with Foradil are similar to those observed with other selective beta2-adrenoceptor agonists. These effects can include (but are not limited to) the following:
Angina
Muscle cramps
Rapid or irregular heartbeat
Nervousness

For additional information on Foradil, please visit Novartis or the product web site at www.foradil.com.","Mechanism of Action
Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (beta2-agonist). Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator.
The pharmacologic effects of beta2 adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.

The FDA approval of Nucala was based on three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials: 1 dose-ranging and exacerbation trial (Trial 1) and 2 confirmatory trials (Trials 2 and 3).
Trial 1:
Trial 1 was a 52-week dose-ranging and exacerbation-reduction trial in subjects with asthma with a history of 2 or more exacerbations in the previous year despite regular use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller(s) with or without oral corticosteroids. Subjects enrolled in this trial were required to have at least 1 of the following 4 pre-specified criteria in the previous 12 months: blood eosinophil count greater than or equal to 300 cells/mcL, sputum eosinophil count greater than or equal to 3%, exhaled nitric oxide concentration greater than or equal to 50 ppb, or deterioration of asthma control after less than or equal to 25% reduction in regular maintenance inhaled corticosteroids/oral corticosteroids. Three IV doses of mepolizumab (75, 250, and 750 mg) administered once every 4 weeks were evaluated compared with placebo. Results from this trial and the pharmacodynamic study supported the evaluation of mepolizumab 75 mg IV and 100 mg SC in the subsequent trials.
Trials 2 and 3:
A total of 711 subjects with asthma were studied in the 2 confirmatory trials (Trials 2 and 3). In these 2 trials subjects were required to have blood eosinophils of greater than or equal to 150 cells/mcL at screening (within 6 weeks of dosing) or blood eosinophils of greater than or equal to 300 cells/mcL within 12 months of enrollment. The screening blood eosinophils of greater than or equal to 150 cells/mcL criterion was derived from exploratory analyses of data from Trial 1. Trial 2 was a 32-week placebo- and active-controlled trial in subjects with asthma with a history of 2 or more exacerbations in the previous year despite regular use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller(s) with or without oral corticosteroids. Subjects received mepolizumab 75 mg IV (n = 191), Nucala (n = 194), or placebo (n = 191) once every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. Trial 3 was a 24-week oral corticosteroid-reduction trial in subjects with asthma who required daily oral corticosteroids in addition to regular use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller(s) to maintain asthma control. Subjects in Trial 3 were not required to have a history of exacerbations in the prior year. Subjects received Nucala (n = 69) or placebo (n = 66) once every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. The baseline mean oral corticosteroid use was similar in the 2 treatment groups: 13.2 mg in the placebo group and 12.4 mg in the group receiving Nucala.
Results:
The primary endpoint for Trials 1 and 2 was the frequency of exacerbations defined as worsening of asthma requiring use of oral/systemic corticosteroids and/or hospitalization and/or emergency department visits. For subjects on maintenance oral corticosteroids, an exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids was defined as the use of oral/systemic corticosteroids at least double the existing dose for at least 3 days. Compared with placebo, subjects receiving Nucala or mepolizumab 75 mg IV experienced significantly fewer exacerbations. Additionally, compared with placebo, there were fewer exacerbations requiring hospitalization and/or emergency department visits and exacerbations requiring only in-patient hospitalization with Nucala. Trial 3 evaluated the effect of NUCALA on reducing the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was the percent reduction of oral corticosteroid dose during Weeks 20 to 24 compared with baseline dose, while maintaining asthma control. Compared with placebo, subjects receiving Nucala achieved greater reductions in daily maintenance oral corticosteroid dose, while maintaining asthma control. Sixteen (23%) subjects in the group receiving Nucala versus 7 (11%) in the placebo group had a 90% to 100% reduction in their oral corticosteroid dose. Twenty-five (36%) subjects in the group receiving Nucala versus 37 (56%) in the placebo group were classified as having no improvement for oral corticosteroid dose. Additionally, 54% of subjects treated with Nucala achieved at least a 50% reduction in the daily prednisone dose compared with 33% of subjects treated with placebo.
The FDA approval of Nucala for use in children 6 to 11 years of age was based on an open-label study, conducted in children aged six to 11 years with severe eosinophilic asthma. The study investigated Nucalaâ€™s pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and long-term safety. Evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and adolescents also supported approval in this age group. The 52-week long-term phase of the study showed that the safety profile in paediatric patients aged six to 11 years was similar to the known safety profile in patients aged 12 years and older.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Nucala may include, but are not limited to, the following;
headache
injection site reaction
back pain
fatigue
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Nucala or severe asthma please visit http://www.nucala.com/","Mechanism of Action
Nucala (mepolizumab) is an interleukin-5 antagonist monoclonal antibody (IgG1 kappa). IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth and differentiation, recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils. Mepolizumab binds to IL-5 with a dissociation constant of 100 pM, inhibiting the bioactivity of IL-5 by blocking its binding to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Multiple cell types and mediators are involved in inflammation. Mepolizumab, by inhibiting IL-5 signaling, reduces the production and survival of eosinophils; however, the mechanism of mepolizumab action in asthma has not been definitively established.

Asthma,Qvar (beclomethasone dipropionate),"General Information
Qvar has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of asthma in children 5-11 years of age. This metered dose inhaler is currently marketed for asthma in adults and children 12 years of age and older.
Qvar utilizes a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant for the delivery of a novel formulation of beclomethasone dipropionate. Beclomethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid that produces anti-inflammatory activity. With Qvar, beclomethasone is delivered in smaller-sized particles that allow the medication to reach the small airways of the lung.
According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, approximately 18 million Americans have asthma. Asthma is the leading cause of hospitalization and school absenteeism among children under the age of 15.
","Side Effects
The following adverse events were reported in clinical trials testing Qvar in individuals 12 years of age and older:
Headache
Pharyngitis (sore throat)
Upper respiratory tract infection
Rhinitis (nasal inflammation)
In rare instances, hypersensitivity reactions (such as hives, rash and bronchospasm) have been reported following the oral and intranasal inhalation of beclomethasone dipropionate.
","Additional Information
Qvar was originally developed by the company 3M. In April 2002, Ivax and 3M reported the signing of an agreement that gives Ivax exclusive US rights to the Qvar product.
For additional information on Qvar, please visit www.qvar.com.","Mechanism of Action
Airway inflammation is known to be an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Inflammation occurs in both large and small airways. Corticosteroids have multiple anti-inflammatory effects, inhibiting both inflammatory cells and release of inflammatory mediators. It is presumed that these anti-inflammatory actions play an important role in the efficacy of beclomethasone dipropionate in controlling symptoms and improving lung function in asthma. Inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate probably acts topically at the site of deposition in the bronchial tree after inhalation. (from Qvar Prescribing Information)

Asthma,Serevent,"General Information
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Serevent for the maintenance treatment of asthma and in the prevention of bronchospasm in patients 12 years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease. This includes patients with symptoms of nocturnal asthma, who require regular treatment with inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists.",,,
Asthma,Singulair,"General Information
Of the new class of asthma medicines called leukotriene blockers, Singulair is the first intended for both adults and children as young as six, and the first developed for once-daily use. Singulair works by blocking leukotrienes, powerful substances that are involved in the inflammatory process associated with asthma.
Singulair has been studied for the long-term control of asthma, but is not intended for the relief of acute asthma episodes or symptoms. It should not be used to relieve an asthma episode or be abruptly substituted for oral or inhaled corticosteroids. Patients should have quick-relief medicines available to treat worsening asthma.
Clinical Results
The marketing clearance of Singulair is based on clinical studies that measured efficacy and safety in more than 3,000 adults and children, aged six to 14 years.
In clinical studies, Singulair improved asthma control in many patients by significantly decreasing asthma attacks, preventing daytime and night-time asthma symptoms, and reducing reliance on other asthma medicines, such as quick-relieving bronchodilators. It also allowed many patients to reduce gradually their use of inhaled steroids. Inhaled steroids are the most commonly used drugs for long-term asthma control, but they can be difficult to use and have been associated with potential side effects, particularly at high doses and with long-term use. However, Singulair may not completely eliminate the need for inhaled or systemic corticosteroids. Patients should not decrease or stop taking other asthma medicines unless instructed by their doctor.
","Side Effects
Side effects with Singulair were usually mild and generally did not require patients to stop taking Singulair. Side effects seen in adults and children during the clinical trials were similar for the groups treated with Singulair and for those treated with placebo. The most commonly reported side effects in adults for both placebo and Singulair were headache, influenza and abdominal pain. There was no increase in side effects with extended treatment, and no clinically meaningful drug interactions.",,
Asthma,Tilade (nedocromil sodium),"General Information
Tilade has been approved to extend its application to children ages six to eleven. It is an inhaled anti inflammatory drug indicated as maintenance therapy for mild to moderate bronchial asthma. Tilade was previously approved for patients 12 and older.
Tilade can be used in conjunction with inhaled corticosteroids, and inhaled and oral bronchodilators. It is not recommended for the reversal of acute bronchospasm.
Clinical Results
The results of an 8 week double blind, parallel group study involving 146 children ages 6 11 demonstrated that Tilade controlled asthma symptoms and reduced the need for patients to use a rescue bronchodilator. There was also a statistically significant difference, in favor of Tilade, for all symptom scores (daytime asthma, sleep disturbance, daytime cough, morning asthma, parent's opinion, clinician's opinion, and bronchodilator use).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects reported were unpleasant taste, rhinitis, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.",,
Asthma,Tilade (nedocromil sodium),"General Information
Tilade Nebulizer Solution (nedocromil sodium inhalation solution) has been approved as a treatment for mild to moderate asthma in patients two years of age and older. Tilade Solution is a new dosage form of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's Tilade Inhaler, an inhaled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent for the preventive management of mild to moderate asthma. A nebulizer is a device used to reduce liquid medication to fine particles so that it can be delivered by inhalation to the respiratory tract.
Clinical Results
The safety and efficacy of Tilade Nebulizer Solution was studied in eight randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled U.S. clinical trials of 1,403 patients with mild to moderate asthma. Patients treated with Tilade Nebulizer Solution experienced statistically significant reductions in asthma symptoms, and a greater increase in morning peak expiratory flow rates vs. placebo.
","Side Effects

Asthma,"Vanceril 84 mcg Double Strength (beclomethasone dipropionate, 84 mcg) Inhalation Aerosol","General Information
Vanceril 84 mcg Double Strength has been approved for the treatment of asthma.
As a concentrated, twice-daily formulation with the same active ingredient as Vanceril, Vanceril 84 mcg Double Strength represents a significant step forward in simplifying asthma therapy. Available by prescription as a metered dose inhaler, Vanceril 84 mcg Double Strength is indicated in the maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy and for asthma patients who require systemic corticosteroid administration, where adding Vanceril 84 Double Strength may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic corticosteroids.
Clinical Results
The efficacy of Vanceril 84 mcg Double Strength was demonstrated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 423 subjects with bronchial asthma who had been switched form other oral inhaled steroids. Vanceril 84 mcg Double Strength dosed two puffs, twice daily (BID) was shown to significantly improve pulmonary function and control other asthma symptoms. The usual recommended starting dosage for Vanceril 84 mcg Double Strength is two puffs, twice daily for adults and children as young as six years old.
In a randomized, four-week clinical trial, the incidence of adverse events for Vanceril 84 mcg Double Strength was similar to that reported for placebo. The incidence of oral candidiasis was less than one percent. No hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression was reported in a clinical study of adult subjects who received daily doses of 840 mcg for 35.5. days. In 20 years of U.S. clinical experience, beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), the active ingredient in Vanceril and Vanceril 84 mcg Double Strength, has demonstrated a favorable systemic safety profile with regard to HPA axis suppression, bone metabolism, long-term growth in children and adverse events.
",,"Additional Information
An estimated 14 million Americans suffer from asthma, including four million children under the age of 18. A lung disease characterized by inflammation and obstruction of the airways that transport air from the nose and mouth to the lungs, asthma interferes with the lungsâ€™ life-supporting functions of removing carbon dioxide from the blood and replacing it with oxygen. While there is no known cure, asthma can be controlled with medication.",
Asthma,Ventolin HFA (albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol),"General Information
Ventolin HFA has been approved for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in adults and children four years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease, and for the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm in patients four years of age and older. Ventolin HFA is a new version of the Ventolin metered-dose inhaler (MDI) currently marketed by GlaxoSmithKline. However unlike the current version, the new inhaler does not use chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to propel the medication. Ventolin HFA uses an alternative propellant called HFA or hydrofluoroalkane.
CFCs have been implicated in the depletion of the ozone layer, and as a result, the use of CFC-aerosol products in the United States has been sharply curtailed over the last few decades. While CFC production and importation have been banned for all commercial purposes in the United States since 1996, an exception is made for medical products that are considered essential with no suitable alternatives. While no action to remove the albuterol CFC MDIs from the market is planned at this time, the approval of Ventolin HFA provides an additional albuterol HFA MDI option to patients and physicians.
Clinical Results
A 12-week, randomized, double-blind trial compared Ventolin HFA to CFC 11/12-propelled albuterol and an HFA-134a placebo inhaler. The trial included adolescent and adult subjects (12-76 years of age) with mild to moderate asthma. Serial forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) measurements showed that two inhalations of Ventolin HFA produced a significantly greater improvement in FEV1 over the pretreatment value than placebo.
A second 12-week, randomized, double-blind trial evaluated the effectiveness of switching subjects from CFC 11/12-propelled albuterol to Ventolin HFA. In an initial run-in phase, all subjects received CFC 11/12-propelled albuterol. During the double-blind treatment phase, Ventolin HFA was compared to CFC 11/12-propelled albuterol and an HFA-134a placebo inhaler in adolescent and adult subjects with mild to moderate asthma. Serial FEV1 measurements showed that two inhalations of Ventolin HFA produced significantly greater improvement in pulmonary function than placebo. The switching from CFC 11/12-propelled albuterol inhaler to Ventolin HFA did not reveal any clinically significant changes in the efficacy profile.
Additionally, a two-week, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted to compare Ventolin HFA, CFC 11/12-propelled albuterol, and an HFA-134a placebo inhaler in 135 pediatric subjects (4-11 years old) with mild to moderate asthma. Serial pulmonary function measurements showed that two inhalations of Ventolin HFA produced significantly greater improvement in pulmonary function than placebo, and that there were no significant differences between the groups treated with Ventolin HFA and CFC 11/12-propelled albuterol.
A controlled trial in adult subjects with asthma showed that two inhalations of Ventolin HFA taken approximately 30 minutes prior to exercise significantly prevented exercise-induced bronchospasm compared to an HFA-134a placebo inhaler. In addition, Ventolin HFA was shown to be clinically comparable to a CFC 11/12-propelled albuterol inhaler for this indication. (from Ventolin HFA Product Information)
","Side Effects
Adverse events reported from clinical trials include (but are not limited to) the following:
Throat irritation
Upper respiratory inflammation
Viral respiratory infections
Cough
Musculoskeletal pain
Overall, the adverse events were similar between Ventolin HFA and a CFC 11/12-propelled albuterol inhaler. Additionally, according to the results of a two-week pediatric trial, the pediatric adverse event profile was generally similar to that of the adult.

In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that albuterol has a preferential effect on beta2-adrenergic receptors compared to isoproterenol. Activation of beta2-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenylcyclase, and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). This increase of cyclic AMP leads to the activation of protein kinase A, which inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in relaxation. Albuterol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bonchioles. Albuterol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges.

Arteriosclerosis / atherosclerosis,Praluent (alirocumab),"General Information
Praluent (alirocumab) is a PCSK9 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin Type 9) inhibitor antibody.
Praluent is specifically indicated as adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who require additional lowering of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). Praluent is also indicated to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adults with established cardiovascular (CV) disease.
Praluent is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous use. The recommended starting dose for Praluent is 75 mg administered subcutaneously once every 2 weeks, since the majority of patients achieve sufficient LDL-C reduction with this dosage. If the LDL-C response is inadequate, the dosage may be increased to the maximum dosage of 150 mg administered every 2 weeks.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Praluent was based on five double-blind placebo-controlled trials that enrolled 3,499 patients; 36% were patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and 54% were non-FH patients who had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Three of the five trials were conducted exclusively in patients with HeFH. All patients were receiving a maximally tolerated dose of a statin, with or without other lipid-modifying therapies. All trials were at least 52 weeks in duration with the primary efficacy endpoint measured at week 24 (mean percent change in LDL-C from baseline). Three studies used an initial dose of 75 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) followed by criteria-based uptitration to 150 mg Q2W at week 12 for patients who did not achieve their pre-defined target LDL-C at week 8. The majority of patients (57% to 83%) who were treated for at least 12 weeks did not require up-titration. Two studies used a 150 mg Q2W dose.
Study 1 was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned 1,553 patients to Praluent 150 mg Q2W and 788 patients to placebo. Overall, 69% were non-FH patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 18% had HeFH. The average LDL-C at baseline was 122 mg/dL. At week 24, the treatment difference between Praluent and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -58% (p-value: Ë‚0.0001).
Study 2 was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned 209 patients to Praluent and 107 to placebo. Overall 84% had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Mean baseline LDL-C was 102 mg/dL. At week 12, the mean percent change from baseline in LDL-C was -45% with Praluent compared to 1% with placebo, and the treatment difference between Praluent 75mg Q2W and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -46%. At week 12, if additional LDL-C lowering was required based on pre-specified LDL-C criteria, Praluent was up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W for the remainder of the trial. At week 24, the mean percent change from baseline in LDL-C was -44% with Praluent and -2% with placebo, and the treatment difference between Praluent and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -43% (p-value: Ë‚0.0001). The dose was up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W in 32 (17%) of 191 patients treated with Praluent for at least 12 weeks.
Studies 3 and 4 were multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that, combined, randomly assigned 490 patients to Praluent and 245 to placebo. The trials were similar with regard to both design and eligibility criteria. All patients had HeFH, were taking a maximally tolerated dose of statin with or without other lipid-modifying therapy, and required additional LDL-C reduction. Overall, 45% of these patients with HeFH also had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The average LDL-C at baseline was 141 mg/dL. At week 12, the treatment difference between Praluent 75 mg Q2W and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -48%. At week 12, if additional LDL-C lowering was required based on pre-specified LDL-C criteria, Praluent was up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W for the remainder of the trials. At week 24, the mean treatment difference between Praluent and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change from baseline was -54% (p-value: Ë‚0.0001). The dose was up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W in 196 (42%) of 469 patients treated with Praluent for at least 12 weeks. The LDL-C-lowering effect was sustained to week 52.
Study 5 was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned 72 patients to Praluent 150 mg Q2W and 35 patients to placebo. Patients had HeFH with a baseline LDL-C â‰¥160 mg/dL while taking a maximally tolerated dose of statin with or without other lipid-modifying therapy. Overall, 50% had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The average LDL-C at baseline was 198 mg/dL. At week 24, the mean percent change from baseline in LDL-C was -43% with Praluent and -7% with placebo, and the treatment difference between Praluent and placebo in mean LDL-C percent change was -36% (p-value: Ë‚0.0001).
The FDA approval of Praluent to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adults with established cardiovascular (CV) disease was based on ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, assessing the effect of adding Praluent to maximally-tolerated statins on CV outcomes in 18,924 patients who had an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) within a year of enrolling in the trial. Patients who received Praluent in the trial experienced:
A 15% reduced risk for major CV events. The primary endpoint included time to first heart attack, stroke, death from coronary heart disease (CHD), or unstable angina requiring hospitalization
A 27% reduced risk of stroke, 14% reduced risk of non-fatal heart attack and 39% reduced risk of unstable angina requiring hospitalization.
A 15% reduced risk of death from any cause (also called all-cause mortality) was also observed.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Praluent or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, please visit https://www.praluent.com/","Mechanism of Action
Praluent (alirocumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) on the surface of hepatocytes to promote LDLR degradation within the liver. LDLR is the primary receptor that clears circulating LDL, therefore the decrease in LDLR levels by PCSK9 results in higher blood levels of LDL-C. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, alirocumab increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.

Terbinafine hydrochloride is a synthetic allylamine derivative. Terbinafine hydrochloride is hypothesized to act by inhibiting the epoxidation of squalene, thus blocking the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. The allylamine derivatives, like the benzylamines, act at an earlier step in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway than the azole class of antifungal drugs. Depending on the concentration of the drug and the fungal species tested in vitro, terbinafine hydrochloride may be fungicidal. However, the clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown.

Athlete's foot,Lotrisone (clotrimazole/betamethasone diproprionate) lotion,"General Information
Lotrisone lotion has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of symptomatic inflammatory tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis due to Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton rubrum. Lotrisone contains two compounds - a synthetic corticosteroid (betamethasone dipropionate) and a synthetic antifungal agent (clotrimazole) - that target different aspects of fungal infection. Clotrimazole targets the cause of the infection by inhibiting the growth of fungus on the skin, whereas betamethasone reduces fungal infection symptoms such as itching, swelling, and redness.
","Side Effects
Side effects of Lotrisone may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Blistering
Hives
Infection
Irritated skin
Itching
Peeling
Skin eruptions and rash
Tingling sensation
Less common side effects may include the following:
Acne
Burning
Excessive hair growth
Inflamed hair follicles
","Additional Information
For additional information on Lotrisone, please visit the web site of Schering-Plough Corporation.","Mechanism of Action
Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum, antifungal agent used for the treatment of superficial infections caused by species of pathogenic dermatophytes, yeasts, and Malassezia furfur. The mechanism of action involves inhibition of the synthesis of ergosterol, a major sterol in the fungal cell membrane. This leads to instability of the cell membrane and eventual death of the fungus.
Betamethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The exact mechanisms of action of corticosteroids in each disease are uncertain; however, betamethasone dipropionate has been shown to have dermatological and systemic pharmacologic and metabolic effects characteristic of this class of drugs.

Mentax is the only topical antifungal product approved in the U.S. which has such a one-week dosing regimen.",,,
Atopic dermatitis (eczema),Desonate (desonide),"General Information
Desonate 0.05% gel contains desonide, a synthetic nonfluorinated topical corticosteroid. These compounds have anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties.
Desonate is specifically indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in patients 3 months of age and older.
Desonate is supplied as a gel for topical administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is a thin layer applied to the affected areas two times daily and rubbed in gently. Treatment duration should not exceed four weeks.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Desonate was based on the results of two clinical trials. These multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies enrolled a combined 582 pediatric patients (ages 3 months to 18 years), who received topical administration of the drug or placebo (vehicle gel) twice daily for 4 weeks. Treatment success was defined as achieving clear or almost clear on the Investigatorâ€™s Global Severity Score (IGSS) with at least a 2 point change (decrease) from the subjectâ€™s baseline IGSS when compared to the Week 4 IGSS. Results revealed that in clinical trial 1, treatment success was achieved by 44% of the subjects treated with Desonate versus 14% of the subjects treated with placebo. In clinical trial 2, success was achieved by 28% of the subjects treated with Desonate versus 6% of the subjects treated with placebo.

","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Desonate may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Headache
Application site burning
Rash
Application site pruritus
In addition, systemic absorption of Desonate, as well as other topical corticosteroids, can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment. Systemic absorption is augmented by the application of topical corticosteroids over large body surface areas, prolonged use or the addition of occlusive dressings. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Desonate or atopic dermatitis, please visit the Desonate web page.","Mechanism of Action
Desonate Gel contains desonide, a synthetic nonfluorinated corticosteroid for topical dermatologic use. Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties, however the general mechanism of action is unclear. Corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is thought that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.

Atopic dermatitis (eczema),Dupixent (dupilumab),"General Information
Dupixent (dupilumab) is an interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist.
Dupixent is specifically indicated for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable.
Dupixent is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous administration. The recommended dose of Dupixent for adults is an initial dose of 600 mg (two 300 mg injections), followed by 300 mg given every other week. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be used, but should be reserved for problem areas only, such as the face, neck, intertriginous and genital areas. If a dose is missed, the injection should be administered within 7 days from the missed dose and then the original schedule should be resumed. If the missed dose is not administered within 7 days, the patient should wait until the next dose on the original schedule.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Dupixent was based on three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials which enrolled subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) not adequately controlled by topical medication(s). Disease severity was defined by an Investigatorâ€™s Global Assessment (IGA) score â‰¥3 in the overall assessment of AD lesions on a severity scale of 0 to 4, an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score â‰¥16 on a scale of 0 to 72, and a minimum body surface area involvement of â‰¥10%. All three trials assessed the primary endpoint, the change from baseline to Week 16 in the proportion of subjects with an IGA 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and at least a 2-point improvement.
LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 enrolled 1,379 adults with moderate-to-severe AD in the identically-designed trials. Subjects were randomized into one of three treatment groups: dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneously once per week, dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneously every two weeks, or placebo for 16 weeks following an initial dupilumab loading dose of 600 mg subcutaneously, or placebo. Both trials met the primary endpoints. For SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, respectively, 37 and 36% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg weekly, and 38 and 36% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg every two weeks, achieved clearing or near-clearing of skin lesions (IGA 0 or 1), compared to 10 and 8.5% with placebo (p less than 0.0001).
LIBERTY AD CHRONOS enrolled 700 adults with moderate-to-severe AD. The trial was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab when administered concomitantly with topical corticosteroids through 16 weeks. Secondary objectives of the study included the long-term safety and efficacy of dupilumab up to 52 weeks. The primary endpoints at week 16 were reached: 39% of patients who received either dupilumab 300 mg weekly with TCS or dupilumab 300 mg every two weeks with TCS achieved clearing or near-clearing of skin lesions (IGA 0 or 1), compared to 12% of patients receiving placebo with TCS (p less than 0.0001). 64% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg weekly with TCS, and 69% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg every two weeks with TCS achieved EASI-75, a 75 percent reduction on an index measuring eczema severity, compared to 23% of patients receiving placebo with TCS (p less than 0.0001). The secondary endpoint 52-week results were also reached and showed the following: 40% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg weekly with TCS, and 36% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg every two weeks with TCS achieved clearing or near-clearing of skin lesions (IGA 0 or 1), compared to 12.5% of patients receiving placebo with TCS (p less than 0.0001). 64% of patients who received 300 mg weekly with TCS, and 65% of patients who received 300 mg every two weeks with TCS achieved EASI-75, compared to 22% with placebo with TCS (p less than 0.0001).

Dupixent (dupilumab) is a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling by specifically binding to the IL-4RÎ± subunit shared by the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes. Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor. Blocking IL-4RÎ± with dupilumab inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine-induced responses, including the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and IgE.

Atopic dermatitis (eczema),Elidel,"General Information
Elidel is approved for the treatment of atopic dermatits in adults and children ages two years and older. This topical cream should be applied twice-daily. Elidel is the first non-steroid prescription for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis for use in children and adults and is one of the first new treatments since topical corticosteroids were introduced almost 50 years ago.
Commonly known as eczema, atopic dermatitis is an itchy skin condition affecting up to 17 percent of the US population, or more than 40 million Americans. Eczema primarily affects children and may last until the late teenage years or even for life. Ninety percent of sufferers experience symptoms before reaching the age of five.
Clinical Results
The approval of Elidel is based on results from clinical trials in more than 1,700 pediatric and adult patients. Elidel was shown to relieve itching and redness associated with eczema within eight days of starting treatment.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Elidel may include (but are not limited to) the following:

Atopic dermatitis (eczema),Eucrisa (crisaborole) ointment,"General Information
Eucrisa (crisaborole) is a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor.
Eucrisa is specifically indicated for the topical treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in patients 2 years of age and older.
Eucrisa is supplied as an ointment for topical administration. A thin layer of Eucrisa should be applied twice daily to affected areas.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Eucrisa was based on two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled trials (Trials 1 and 2) in a total of 1,522 subjects 2 to 79 years of age (86.3% of subjects were 2 to 17 years of age) with a 5% to 95% treatable body surface area. At baseline, 38.5% of the subjects had an Investigatorâ€™s Static Global Assessment [ISGA] score of 2 (mild), and 61.5% had an ISGA score of 3 (moderate), in the overall assessment of atopic dermatitis (erythema, induration/papulation, and oozing/crusting) on a severity scale of 0 to 4. In both trials, subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive Eucrisa or vehicle applied twice daily for 28 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects at Day 29 who achieved success, defined as an ISGA grade of Clear (score of 0) or Almost Clear (score of 1) with a 2-grade or greater improvement from baseline, comparing Eucrisa-treated subjects to vehicle-treated subjects. In Trial 1, 32.8% of subjects achieved the primary endpoint compared to 25.4% in the vehicle group. Trial 2, 31.4% of subjects achieved the primary endpoint compared to 18% in the vehicle group.

"
Atopic dermatitis (eczema),Protopic (tacrolimus) ointment,"General Information
Protopic (tacrolimus) is a non-steroidal topical ointment for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis, more commonly known as eczema. The 0.1% concentration of tacrolimus ointment was approved for the treatment of adults, while the lower 0.03% concentration was approved for the treatment of both children (ages two and above) and adults for short-term and intermittent long-term therapy.
Eczema is a chronic, life-altering disease characterized by painfully red, swollen, itchy, flaky skin. In some cases the itching and redness is so vast and intense that sufferers will scratch themselves until they bleed, increasing the risk of secondary infection. The majority of eczema cases are diagnosed in early childhood. While 40% of children suffering from eczema outgrow the disease, others live with it throughout their lives.
Routine treatment for eczema frequently includes the use of steroid creams applied to the skin; however, steroids have been associated with side effects including skin thinning and discoloration. Protopic offers physicians another treatment option when conventional treatment is deemed inadvisable because of potential risks, or when patients are not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of conventional therapies.
Clinical Results
Protopic's safety and effectiveness was evaluated in 28 worldwide trials with more than 4,000 adults and children - including those as young as 24 months of age. Trials were conducted in the United States, Europe and Japan, and over one-third of the subjects were children.
The trial data indicated that both concentrations of Protopic significantly improved or cleared the signs and symptoms of the condition in more than two-thirds of the subjects. Many subjects exhibited marked improvement after receiving one week of treatment. Overall, the 0.1% concentration exhibited statistically significant greater efficacy than the 0.03% concentration in adults.
","Side Effects
Similar to other dermatological products currently marketed, it is advised that individuals practice safe sun techniques to avoid direct exposure to natural or artificial sunlight. Skin burning and itching have been associated with the application of Protopic; however, the incidence of these events decreased as the disease improved.

Hoeschst Marion Roussel announced that Cardizem (R) (diltiazem HC1 for injection) Monovial (R) has been cleared for use in the U.S. by the FDA. Cardizem Monovial is an advanced infusion delivery system for Cardizem Injectable, a widely prescribed compound for treatment of certain heartbeat irregularities.
Cardizem Monovial is indicated for maintenance heart rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter for up to 24 hours. Cardizem Monovial is expected to be available beginning in early 1998.

Atrial fibrillation,Corvert Injection (ibutilide fumarate injection),"General Information
Covert Injection was approved to treat atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, two common arrhythmias that cause irregular contractions of the heart. Covert is indicated for the rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm.
Clinical Results
The results of two, large, placebo-controlled, double-blind and randomized clinical trials demonstrated that, compared with placebo, Corvert Injection successfully and rapidly converted atrial fibrillation and flutter to normal rhythm. In a third study conducted in Europe, Covert compared favorably with another intravenous antiarrhythmic agent currently unavailable in the United States
","Side Effects
A small number of subjects (1.7%) treated with Covert developed sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT), an arrhythmia of the ventricles. This side effect is common to antiarrhythmic agents used to treat atrial fibrillation and flutter and is potentially life threatening. However, the small number of subjects who developed PVT were successfully treated with electrical cardioversion.
","Additional Information
The atria are the upper chambers of the heart. They receive blood from the body and lungs; they load the ventricles, the primary pumping chambers of the heart; and they regulate, with electrical currents, the pace of contraction (heart beat) for the entire heart. Atrial fibrillation and flutter are common arrhythmias that cause irregular contractions of the heart. Alone, the conditions are not considered life-threatening. But they can lead to decreased cardiac output, congestive heart failure and low blood pressure in some subjects. Atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for embolic stroke. Prevalence of these arrhythmias increases with age. Atrial fibrillation affects 0.4% of Americans under the age of 60 and 2% to 4% of those over 60 years of age.
Electrical cardioversion is the primary treatment option for subjects who would benefit from rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter to normal sinus rhythm. The procedure, which delivers an electrical current to the heart, requires anesthesia to minimize subject discomfort.",
Atrial fibrillation,Eliquis (apixaban),"General Information
Eliquis (apixaban) is an orally available Factor Xa antagonist. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban decreases thrombin generation and thrombus development.
Eliquis is specifically indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
Eliquis is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended dose for most patients is 5 mg taken orally twice daily. The recommended dose of Eliquis is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with any two of the following characteristics: > age 80 years, body weight <60 kg, serum creatinine is >1.5 mg/dL. When Eliquis is coadministered with drugs that are strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Eliquis was based on two clinical trials, ARISTOTLE and AVERROES.
ARISTOTLE
This multinational, double-blind study enrolled 18,201 subjects with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). The subjects were randomized to Eliquis 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in subjects meeting certain parameters- see above) or to warfarin . The trial was designed to compare the effects of Eliquis and warfarin on the risk of stroke and non-central nervous system (CNS) systemic embolism. The primary endpint was the non-inferiority of Eliquis to warfarin in reducing the risk of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism. Superiority of Eliquis to warfarin was also examined for the primary endpoint (rate of stroke and systemic embolism), major bleeding, and death from any cause. The subjects were followed for a median of 89 weeks. Eliquis was superior to warfarin for the primary endpoint of reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (Eliquis: 212 subjects (1.27%) versus warfarin (265 subjects (1.60%); p=0.01). Eliquis also showed significantly fewer major bleeds than warfarin. Eliquis also resulted in a significantly lower rate of all-cause death (p = 0.046) than did treatment with warfarin, primarily because of a reduction in cardiovascular death, particularly stroke deaths. Non-vascular death rates were similar in the treatment arms.
AVERROES
This trial enrolled 5,598 subjects with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation thought not to be candidates for warfarin therapy. Subjects were randomized to treatment with Eliquis 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients) or aspirin 81 to 324 mg once daily. The primary objective of the study was to determine if Eliquis was superior to aspirin for preventing the composite outcome of stroke or systemic embolism. AVERROES was stopped early on the basis of a prespecified interim analysis showing a significant reduction in stroke and systemic embolism for Eliquis compared to aspirin that was associated with a modest increase in major bleeding.
","Side Effects
The most common adverse events associated with the use of Eliquis are related to bleeding.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Eliquis or stroke and systemic embolism resulting from nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, please visit the Eliquis web page.","Mechanism of Action
Eliquis (apixaban) is an orally available Factor Xa antagonist. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound FXa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban decreases thrombin generation and thrombus development.

The subjects were at least 75 years old or at least 70 years old with one risk factor. They were randomized and treated for up to 30 months with either Multaq 400 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to conventional therapy for cardiovascular diseases. The primary endpoint, time to first hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons or death from any cause, was significantly decreased in the Multaq arm (by 24%) versus placebo (p=0.00000002). Several secondary endpoints were reached as well, including a significant decrease in the risk of cardiovascular death by 30% (p=0.03) with Multaq plus standard therapy. Multaq also significantly decreased the risk of arrhythmic death by 45% (p=0.01) and there were numerically fewer deaths (16%) from any cause in the Multaq group compared to placebo (p=0.17). First cardiovascular hospitalization was reduced by 25% (p=0.000000009).
EURIDIS and ADONIS
These two studies enrolled 1,237 subjects (20 to 88 years) in sinus rhythm with a prior episode of AF or AFL. The subjects were randomized in an outpatient setting and treated with either Multaq 400 mg twice daily or placebo on top of conventional therapies. All subjects had at least one ECG-documented AF/AFL episode during the 3 months prior to study entry but were in sinus rhythm for at least one hour. In the pooled data, as well as in the individual trials, dronedarone delayed the time to first recurrence of AF/AFL (primary endpoint), lowering the risk of first AF/AFL recurrence during the 12-month study period by about 25%, with an absolute difference in recurrence rate of about 11% at 12 months.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Multaq may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Diarrhea
Asthenic conditions
Nausea
Skin infections
Abdominal pain
Bradycardia
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Multaq or paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, please visit the Multaq web page.","Mechanism of Action
Multaq (dronedarone) is a benzofuran derivative with antiarrhythmic properties belonging to all four Vaughan-Williams classes. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Dronedarone is a derivative of amiodarone, an effective yet toxic antiarrhythmic drug. Unlike amiodarone, dronedarone does not contain idodine atoms and hence contains the efficacy of amiodarone but without its unique toxicity profile.

Atrial fibrillation,Pradaxa (dabigatran etexilate mesylate),"General Information
Pradaxa (dabigatran etexilate mesylate) is a competitive, direct thrombin inhibitor. Because thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the coagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of a thrombus. Both free and clot-bound thrombin, and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation are inhibited by the active moieties.
Pradaxa is specifically indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.
Pradaxa is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended initial dose for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) >30 mL/min is 150 mg taken orally, twice daily, with or without food. For patients with CrCl 15-30 mL/min, the recommended dose is 75 mg twice daily. Special consideration should be given when converting from or to Warfarin, converting from or to parenteral anticoagulants and in patients scheduled to undergo surgical interventions.
Clinical Results
FDA Approvals
The FDA approval of Pradaxa was based on a multi-center, multinational, randomized parallel group trial dubbed RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant Therapy). The trial compared two blinded doses of Pradaxa (110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily) with open-label warfarin (dosed to target INR of 2 to 3). A total of 18,113 patients with non-valvular, persistent, paroxysmal, or permanent atrial fibrillation were enrolled. All had one or more of the following additional risk factors: previous stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism; left ventricular ejection fraction <40%; symptomatic heart failure, older than 75 years and older than 65 years and one of the following: diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), or hypertension. The primary objective of this study was to determine if Pradaxa was non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the occurrence of the composite endpoint, stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism. Pradaxa 150 mg twice daily significantly reduced the primary composite endpoint of stroke and systemic embolism when compared to warfarin and to Pradaxa 110 mg twice daily (p0.004). Pradaxa 150 mg twice daily significantly reduced both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes relative to warfarin.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Pradaxa may I nclude, but are not limited to, the following:
bleeding
gastrointestinal events (dyspepsia, nausea, upper abdominal pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and diarrhea)

Atrial fibrillation,Savaysa (edoxaban),"General Information
Savaysa (edoxaban) is a Factor Xa inhibitor and works as an anticoagulant.
Savaysa is specifically indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Savaysa is also indicated for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following 5 to 10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant.
Savaysa is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. Savaysa can be taken without regard to food. The recommended dose of Savaysa is as follows:
Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation
The recommended dose is 60 mg taken orally once daily Assess creatinine clearance, as calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, before initiating therapy with Savaysa. Do not use Savaysa in patients with CrCL > 95 mL/min due to an increased risk of ischemic stroke compared to warfarin. Reduce Savaysa dose to 30 mg once daily in patients with CrCL 15 to 50 mL/min.
Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
The recommended dose of Savaysa is 60 mg taken orally once daily following 5 to 10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant. The recommended dose of Savaysa is 30 mg once daily in patients with CrCL 15 to 50 mL/min, patients who weigh less than or equal to 60 kg, or patients who are taking certain concomitant P-gp inhibitor medications based on clinical study data in this indication.
For transition to Savaysa from other medications or from other medications to Savaysa, please see the drug label.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Savaysa was based on the following studies:
Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation
The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study was a multi-national, double-blind, non-inferiority study comparing the efficacy and safety of two Savaysa treatment arms (60 mg and 30 mg) to warfarin (titrated to INR 2.0 to 3.0) in reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolic events in patients with NVAF. A total of 21,105 patients were randomized and followed for a median of 2.8 years and treated for a median of 2.5 years. Patients in the Savaysa treatment arms had their dose halved (60 mg halved to 30 mg or 30 mg halved to 15 mg) if one or more of the following clinical factors were present: CrCL â‰¤ 50 mL/min, low body weight (â‰¤ 60 kg) or concomitant use of specific P-gp inhibitors (verapamil, quinidine, dronedarone). The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of first stroke (either ischemic or hemorrhagic) or of a systemic embolic event (SEE) that occurred during treatment or within 3 days from the last dose taken. Both treatment arms of SAVAYSA were non-inferior to warfarin for the primary efficacy endpoint of stroke or SEE. However, the 30 mg (15 mg dose-reduced) treatment arm was numerically less effective than warfarin for the primary endpoint, and was also markedly inferior in reducing the rate of ischemic stroke. Based on the planned superiority analysis (ITT, which required p < 0.01 for success), statistical superiority of the 60 mg (30 mg dose reduced) treatment arm compared to warfarin was not established in the total study population, but there was a favorable trend. Savaysa demonstrated significantly less major bleeding compared to warfarin.
Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
Hokusai VTE was a multinational, double-blind study which compared the efficacy and safety of Savaysa 60 mg orally once daily to warfarin (titrated to INR 2.0 3.0) in 8,292 patients with acute symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) (DVT or PE with or without DVT). The subjects were randomized to receive Savaysa or warfarin and were followed for a mean treatment duration of 252 days for Savaysa and 250 days for warfarin. In the trial, 3.2% of participants taking Savaysa had a symptomatic recurrent VTE compared to 3.5% of those taking warfarin.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Savaysa may include, but are not limited to, the following:
NVAF:
bleeding
anemia
DVT and PE:
bleeding
rash
abnormal liver function tests
anemia
Savaysa comes with the following boxed warnings:
Reduced efficacy in NVAF patients with CRCL > 95 ML/MIN: Savaysa should not be used in patients with CrCL > 95 mL/min. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study, patients in this cohort had an increased rate of ischemic stroke with Savaysa 60 mg once daily compared to patients treated with warfarin. In these patients another anticoagulant should be used.
Premature discontinuation of Savaysa increases the risk of ischemic events.
Spinal/epidural hematoma: epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with Savaysa who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Savaysa or deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and the risk of stroke and embolism due to atrial fibrillation, please visit http://savaysa.com/","Mechanism of Action
Savaysa (edoxaban) is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Edoxaban inhibits free FXa, and prothrombinase activity and inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Inhibition of FXa in the coagulation cascade reduces thrombin generation and reduces thrombus formation.

Atrial fibrillation,Xarelto (rivaroxaban),"General Information
Xarelto (rivaroxaban) is a factor Xa inhibitor that selectively blocks the active site of factor Xa and does not require a cofactor (such as Anti-thrombin III) for activity. Activation of factor X to factor Xa (FXa) via the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways plays a central role in the cascade of blood coagulation.
Xarelto is specifically indicated for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis, which may lead to pulmonary embolism in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery.
Xarelto is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is 10 mg taken orally once daily with or without food. The initial dose should be taken at least 6 to 10 hours after surgery once hemostasis has been established. For hip replacement surgery a treatment duration of 35 days is recommended. For knee replacement surgery a treatment duration of 12 days is recommended.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xarelto was based on three trials, RECORD 1, 2, and 3, conducted in 9,011 subjects.
RECORD 1 and 2
These randomized, double-blind studies enrolled 6,727 subjects undergoing elective total hip replacement surgery. The trials compared Xarelto 10 mg once daily starting at least 6 to 8 hours after wound closure versus enoxaparin 40 mg once daily started 12 hours preoperatively. In RECORD 1, the mean exposure duration to active Xarelto and enoxaparin was 33.3 and 33.6, respectively. In RECORD 2, the mean exposure duration to active Xarelto and enoxaparin was 33.5 and 12.4, respectively. After Day 13, oral placebo was continued in the enoxaparin group for the remainder of the double-blind study duration.
RECORD 1 Results
The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a 71% relative risk reduction (RRR) (p<0.001) in total VTE (composite of deep vein thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism and all-cause mortality) for the rivaroxaban arm compared to the enoxaparin arm (1.1% and 3.9%, respectively). The secondary endpoint was also achieved, with a 91% RRR (p<0.001) in major VTE (composite of proximal deep vein thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism and VTE-related death) observed in the rivaroxaban arm versus the enoxaparin arm (0.2% and 2.1%, respectively). Rivaroxaban also demonstrated a similar rate of major bleeding to enoxaparin (0.3% and 0.1%, respectively, p=0.178).
RECORD 2 Results
Data showed a 76% RRR (p<0.001) in total VTE and an 87% RRR (p<0.001) in major VTE for subjects treated with rivaroxaban compared with those treated with enoxaparin. Rivaroxaban demonstrated a similar rate of major bleeding compared to enoxaparin (0.1% and 0.1%, respectively, p=0.980).
RECORD 3
This randomized, double-blind study enrolled 1,684 subjects undergoing elective total knee replacement surgery. The trial compared Xarelto 10 mg once daily started at least 6 to 8 hours after wound closure versus enoxaparin 40 mg once daily started 12 hours preoperatively. The mean exposure duration to active Xarelto and enoxaparin was 11.9 and 12.5 days, respectively. Subjects treated with Xarelto demonstrated a 48% relative risk reduction in total DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE) and all-cause mortality when compared to enoxaparin (p<0.001). Major VTE occurred in 1.0% of the Xarelto-treated group and in 2.6% of the enoxaparin-treated group (p=0.01) with a relative risk reduction of 62%. Symptomatic VTE occurred in 1.0% of subjects who received Xarelto, compared to 2.5% of those in the enoxaparin group, a relative risk reduction of 60%. Major bleeding rates were 0.6% and 0.5%, and any bleeding rates were 4.9% and 4.8% for the Xarelto and enoxaparin groups, respectively.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children,Adderall (mixed salts of a single-entity amphetamine),"General Information
Adderall has been indicated for use in children three years of age and older with ADHD as an integral part of a total treatment program which typically includes psychological, educational, and social measures.
Adderall may improve attention span, decrease distractibility, and increase the ability to follow directions and finish tasks. The therapy may also improve the subject's ability to think before acting (decrease impulsivity), decrease hyperactivity and improve legibility of handwriting. In addition, aggression may decrease in youngsters with ADHD.
Adderall is available in 10 mg and 20 mg double-scored tablets.
","Side Effects
Adderall is generally well tolerated with few adverse reactions reported. The most frequently reported adverse reactions include anorexia, insomnia, stomach pain, headache, irritability, and weight loss. As with most psychostimulants indicated for ADHD, the possibility of growth suppression and the potential for precipitating motor tics and Tourette Syndrome exists with Adderall treatment, and in rare cases exacerbations of psychosis have been reported. Since psychostimulants have a high potential for abuse, Adderall should only be prescribed as part of an overall treatment program for ADHD with close physician supervision.

Paget's Disease,Fosamax (alendronate sodium),"General Information
Fosamax reduces the activity of the cells that cause bone loss and helps build healthy bone. It is the first nonhormonal medicine for women after menopause who have osteoporosis.
The FDA also cleared Fosamax for the treatment of Paget's disease of bone, a chronic disorder that affects up to 1.3 million Americans and may result in enlarged and deformed bones in one or more regions of the skeleton.
Clinical Results
The FDA clearance of Fosamax to treat osteoporosis is based on efficacy data from five clinical trials involving 1,827 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in 16 countries who were followed for at least two years.
In clinical trials, Fosamax significantly increased bone mineral density (closely related to bone strength) at the spine (8.2%), hip (7.2%), and other sites. While the studies were not designed to detect fracture risk, further analysis supports that Fosamax reduced the number of women with new spinal fractures by nearly half (48%), reduced the total number of new spinal fractures by 63%, and reduced overall height loss by 35%. Women treated with Fosamax lost an average of 3 mm in height, compared with women on placebo who lost an average of 4.6 mm in height.
","Side Effects
Side effects observed in clinical trials were generally mild. The most commonly reported drug-related side effects in subjects taking Fosamax were abdominal and musculoskeletal pain. Less frequently reported were other digestive disturbances such as nausea, heartburn, and irritation or pain of the esophagus.
","Additional Information
Fosamax is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Osteoporosis is a progressive disease of the skeleton caused by an imbalance in the body's bone-rebuilding cycle. Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass, which results in bones that are prone to fracture, or by the presence or history of an osteoporotic fracture. Bone mass is closely related to bone strength; the greater the bone mass, the stronger the bones and the less likely they are to fracture.
Osteoporosis affects more than 25 million Americans, 80 percent of them women. Each year, osteoporosis causes more than 1.3 million fractures, including 500,000 spinal fractures, 250,000 hip fractures, and 240,000 wrist fractures.
Bone is constantly being rebuilt (or remodeled) throughout life in a process in which old bone tissue is broken down (or resorbed) by cells called osteoclasts and replaced with new bone tissue by cells called osteoblasts. In healthy young adults, the overall rate of remodeling is usually in balance so that the amount of bone lost is about equal to the amount that is replaced.
However, after menopause, more bone is broken down than is replaced, causing bone loss to occur and bones to become weaker. This is due to a drop in the level of estrogen. In the first five years after menopause, women may lose as much as 25% of their bone mass. In fact, menopause is the single most important risk factor for osteoporosis in women.
In patients with Paget's disease of bone, excessive remodeling causes the bone to be enlarged but fragile, and may result in bone pain, deformities, fractures and in some cases, arthritis and neurological complications.
Merck estimates that the retail price for a daily dose of 10 mg will be between $1.65 and $1.80.",
Paget's Disease,Reclast (zoledronic acid),"General Information
Reclast is a bisphosphonic acid inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption. Once administered, it rapidly moves to bone and preferentially localizes at sites of high bone turnover.

Subjects enrolled in the studies received one infusion of 5-mg Reclast or oral daily doses of 30 mg-risedronate for 2 months. Therapeutic response was defined as either normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) or a reduction of at least 75% from baseline in total SAP excess at the end of 6 months. SAP excess was defined as the difference between the measured level and midpoint of normal range. Combined data showed that 96% of the subjects treated with Reclast achieved therapeutic response compared to 74% of those treated with risedronate. At six months, 89% of the Reclast treated subjects achieved normalization of SAP levels versus 58% of those treated with risedronate (p<0.0001). In subjects who had previously received treatment with oral bisphosphonates, 96% reached therapeutic response rates compared to 55% for risedronate. In treatment naÃ¯ve subjects, therapeutic response to Reclast was 98% compared to 86% of those receiving risedronate. In subjects with symptomatic pain at screening, therapeutic response rates were 94% and 70% for Reclast and risedronate respectively. For subjects without pain at screening, therapeutic response rates were 100% and 82% for Reclast and risedronate respectively.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Reclast or Paget's disease, please visit the Reclast web page.","Mechanism of Action
Reclast is a bisphosphonic acid inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption. Once administered, it rapidly moves to bone and preferentially localizes at sites of high bone turnover. The main molecular target of zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase which catalyses the formation of a key cellular intermediate in isoprenoid metabolic pathways.

Paget's Disease,Skelid (tiludronate disodium),"General Information
Skelid, an orally-administered medicine, has been approved for the treatment of Pagetâ€™s disease of bone, a common, potentially debilitating bone disease. Skelid, a new bisphosphonate, has been shown to be a strong inhibitor of bone resorption. It is administered once a day, either in the morning or at night, and is effective in a three-month dosage regimen, rather than the six-month regimen normally employed for other currently-marketed oral bisphosphonates.
Clinical Results
Studies submitted to the FDA show that Skelid can control the abnormal bone growth of Pagetâ€™s disease without interfering with the normal process of bone formation, as indicated by the mineralization rate, bone remodeling and bone turnover.
","Side Effects
The most frequent adverse events in patients receiving Skelid included nausea, diarrhea and dyspepsia. Adverse events usually were mild and generally did not require discontinuation of therapy. Bisphosphonates may cause upper gastrointestinal disorders.
","Additional Information
Pagetâ€™s disease is a chronic bone disease characterized by an excessive rate of bone remodeling, resulting in the formation of disorganized, enlarged and weakened bone structure. Second in prevalence only to osteoporosis as a bone disease, Pagetâ€™s affects an estimated 3 to 4% of the U.S. population over 50 years of age, and is equally common in men and in women.",
Pain,Belbuca (buprenorphine),"General Information
Belbuca buccal film contains buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist.
Belbuca is specifically indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.
Belbuca is supplied as a buccal film for oral administration. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patientâ€™s severity of pain, response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. Iitiate treatment in opioid naÃ¯ve patients with a 75 mcg film once daily or, if tolerated, every 12 hours for at least 4 days, then increase dose to 150 mcg every 12 hours. Individual titration to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions should proceed in increments of 150 mcg every 12 hours, no more frequently than every 4 days. Doses up to 450 mcg every 12 hours were studied in opioid naÃ¯ve patients in the clinical trials.
Please see drug label foe dosing in specific populations, conversions from other analgesics/opioids and titrations and maintenance dosing.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Belbuca was based on three 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in opioid-naÃ¯ve and opioid-experienced patients with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain using pain scores as the primary efficacy variable. Two of these studies demonstrated efficacy in patients with low back pain. One study in low back pain did not show a statistically significant pain reduction for Belbuca compared to placebo.
12-Week Study in Opioid-NaÃ¯ve Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain
A total of 749 patients with chronic low back pain entered an open-label, dose-titration period for up to eight weeks. Patients initiated therapy with a single 75 mcg dose of Belbuca on Day 1 and continued taking Belbuca 75 mcg either once daily or every 12 hours for 4-8 days as tolerated. The dose was then increased to 150 mcg every 12 hours, and patients could continue to dose escalate in 150 mcg dose increments every 4-8 days for up to 6 weeks if the adverse effects were tolerable and the analgesic effects were not adequate. Patients who achieved adequate analgesia and tolerable adverse effects on Belbuca for at least 2 weeks were then randomized to continue their titrated dose of Belbuca or matching placebo. Sixty-one percent (61%) of the patients who entered the open-label dose titration period were able to titrate to a tolerable and effective dose and were randomized into a 12-week, double-blind treatment period.
During the first 2 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients were allowed up to 2 tablets per day of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg as supplemental analgesia to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in patients randomized to placebo. Thereafter, the supplemental analgesia was limited to 1 to 2 tablets of acetaminophen 500 mg per day. Seventy-six percent of the patients treated with Belbuca completed the 12-week treatment compared to 73% of the patients treated with placebo. Of the 209 patients randomized to Belbuca, 4% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 8% due to adverse events. Of the 211 patients randomized to placebo, 11% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 4% due to adverse events.
Of the patients who were randomized, the mean pain (SD) scores on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) were 7.1 (1.06) and 7.2 (1.05) prior to open-label titration and 2.8 (1.01) and 2.8 (1.12) at the beginning of the double-blind period for Belbuca and placebo, respectively. The change from double-blind baseline to week 12 in mean pain (SD) NRS score was statistically significant favoring patients treated with Belbuca, compared with patients treated with placebo. A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (62%) had at least a 30% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint when compared to patients who received placebo buccal film (47%). A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (41%) also had at least a 50% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint compared to patients who received placebo (33%).
12-Week Study in Opioid-Experienced Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain
Eight hundred and ten (810) patients on chronic opioid therapy (total daily dose 30-160 mg in oral morphine sulfate equivalents (MSE) for at least 4 weeks) entered an open-label, dose-titration period with Belbuca for up to 8 weeks, following taper of their prior opioids to 30 mg oral MSE daily. Patients were initiated with Belbuca150 mcg every 12 hours if they were on 30 to 89 mg oral MSE daily and 300 mcg every 12 hours if they were on 90 to160 mg oral MSE daily prior to taper. If a patient tolerated the adverse events and the analgesic effects were not adequate, the dose was increased in increments of 150 mcg every 12 hours after 4 to 8 days for up to 6 weeks. Patients were permitted to take hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg as analgesic rescue as needed up to a maximum of 4 doses per day during the open-label dose titration period. After a dose was reached with adequate analgesia and tolerable adverse effects for a period of 2 weeks, patients were randomized to continue their titrated dose of Belbuca or matching placebo. Sixty-three percent (63%) of the patients who entered the open-label titration period were able to titrate to a tolerable and effective dose and were randomized into a 12-week double-blind treatment phase. Ten percent (10%) of patients discontinued due to an adverse event, 8% discontinued due to lack of a therapeutic effect, and 0.1% discontinued due to opioid withdrawal during the open-label titration period. The remaining 20% of patients discontinued due to various non drug related administrative reasons.
During the double-blind period, patients were permitted to take up to 2 doses of 5/325 mg or 10/650 mg of hydrocodone/acetaminophen per day for the first 2 weeks to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in patients randomized to placebo. After the first 2 weeks, patients were permitted to take 1 dose of 5/325 mg or 10/650 mg per day. Eighty-three percent of patients treated with Belbuca and 57% of patients treated with placebo buccal film completed the 12-week treatment period. Of the 243 patients randomized to Belbuca, 8% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 2% due to adverse events. Of the 248 patients randomized to placebo buccal film, 25% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 5% due to adverse events.
Of the patients who were randomized into the double-blind period, the mean pain (SD) NRS scores were 6.8 (1.28) and 6.6 (1.32) prior to open-label titration and 2.9 (0.985) and 2.8 (1.05) at the beginning of the double-blind period for Belbuca and placebo, respectively. The change from baseline to week 12 in mean pain (SD) NRS score was statistically significant in favor of patients treated with Belbuca compared with patients treated with placebo. A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (64%) had at least a 30% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint when compared to patients who received placebo buccal film (31%). A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (39%) also had at least a 50% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint compared to patients who received placebo (17%).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Belbuca may include, but are not limited to, the following:
nausea
constipation
headache
vomiting
dizziness
somnolence
Belbuca comes with the following boxed warning:
Belbuca exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patientâ€™s risk before prescribing, and monitor regularly for development of these behaviors or conditions.
Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or following a dose increase. Instruct patients on proper administration of Belbuca to reduce the risk.
Accidental exposure to Belbuca, especially in children, can result in fatal overdose of buprenorphine.
Prolonged use of Belbuca during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated.

Pain,Dyloject (diclofenac sodium) Injection,"General Information
Dyloject (diclofenac sodium) Injection is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
Dyloject is specifically indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain and management of moderate to severe pain alone or in combination with opioid analgesics.
Dyloject is supplied as a solution for intravenous administration. The recommended dose of Dyloject is 37.5 mg administered by intravenous bolus injection over 15 seconds every 6 hours as needed, not to exceed 150 mg/day.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Dyloject was based on two double-blind, placebo and active-controlled, multiple-dose clinical trials in patients with postoperative pain. In both trials, intravenous morphine was permitted as rescue medication for pain management.
Study One
In a controlled, multiple-dose study of adult patients with postoperative pain who had undergone elective abdominal or pelvic surgery, 245 patients were treated with Dyloject, a positive NSAID control (ketorolac tromethamine), or placebo administered every 6 hours starting within 6 hours after surgery and for up to 5 days. The study population consisted of patients with a mean age of 43 years (range 18 to 65 years) and a minimum pain intensity of 50 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) at baseline. The mean baseline pain intensity on the VAS was 68 mm (range 50 to 100 mm). Approximately 63% of subjects in the Dyloject 37.5 mg group and 92% of subjects in the placebo group took rescue medication within the first 48 hours of the treatment phase. Efficacy was demonstrated by a reduction in pain intensity as measured by the sum of the pain intensity differences over 0 to 48 hours in patients receiving Dyloject as compared to placebo.
Study Two
In a controlled, multiple-dose study of adult patients with postoperative pain who had undergone elective orthopedic surgery, 277 patients were treated with Dyloject, a positive NSAID control (ketorolac tromethamine), or placebo administered every 6 hours starting within 6 hours postsurgery and for up to 5 days. The study population consisted of patients with a mean age of 55 years (range 19 to 84 years) and a minimum pain intensity of 50 mm on a 100-mm VAS at baseline. The mean baseline pain intensity on the VAS was 69 mm (range 50 to 100 mm). Approximately 74% of subjects in the Dyloject group and 92% of subjects in the placebo group took rescue medication within the first 48 hours of the treatment phase. Efficacy was demonstrated by a reduction in pain intensity as measured by the sum of the pain intensity differences over 0- to 48 hours in patients receiving Dyloject as compared to placebo.

Pain,Embeda (morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride),"General Information
Embeda is an extended-release oral formulation of morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride. Morphine sulfate is an agonist and naltrexone hydrochloride is an antagonist at the mu-opioid receptor. Morphine provides analgesic and sedative effects while naltrexone hydrochloride reverses the subjective and analgesic effects.
Embeda is specifically indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time.
Embeda is supplied as a capsule intended for oral administration. The recommended dosing regimens are as follows:
Initiating therapy with Embeda
The dosing regimen should be calculated individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience.
Use of Embeda as the First Opioid Analgesic
The lowest dose of Embeda should be used as the initial opioid analgesic. Patients may subsequently be titrated to a once or twice a day dosage which adequately manages their pain.
Conversion from Other Oral Morphine Formulations to Embeda
Patients on other oral morphine formulations may be converted to Embeda by administering one-half of the patient's total daily oral morphine dose as Embeda every 12 hours (twice-a-day) or by administering the total daily oral morphine dose as Embeda every 24 hours (once-a-day). Embeda should not be given more frequently than every 12 hours.
Conversion from Oral Opioids, Parenteral Morphine, or Other Parenteral Opioids to Embeda
Embeda can be administered to patients previously receiving treatment with parenteral morphine or other opioids.
1) Parenteral to Oral Morphine Ratio: It may take anywhere from 2-6 mg of oral morphine to provide analgesia equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral morphine.
2) Other Oral or Parenteral Opioids to Oral Morphine Sulfate: There is lack of systematic evidence bearing on these types of analgesic substitutions. Therefore, specific recommendations are not possible.
Individualization of Dosage
Patients may develop some degree of tolerance, requiring dosage adjustment until they have achieved their individual balance between effective analgesia and opioid side effects such as confusion, sedation, and constipation.
Embeda should be titrated no more frequently than every-other-day to allow patients to stabilize before escalating the dose.
If breakthrough pain occurs, the dose may be supplemented with a small dose (less than 20% of the total daily dose) of a short-acting analgesic.
Patients who exhibit signs of excessive opioid side effects such as sedation should have their dose reduced.
Patients who experience inadequate analgesia on once-daily dosing should be switched to twice-a-day.
Embeda should not be dosed more frequently than every 12 hours.
Alternative Methods of Administration
Patients who have difficulty swallowing whole capsules or tablets may benefit from an alternative method of administration. Embeda pellets may be sprinkled over apple sauce. Other foods have not been tested and should not be substituted for apple sauce.
Maintenance of Therapy
Continual re-evaluation of the patient receiving morphine sulfate is important, with special attention to the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of side effects associated with therapy.
Cessation of Therapy
In general, Embeda should not be abruptly discontinued. However, Embeda, like other opioids, can be safely discontinued without the development of withdrawal symptoms by slowly tapering the daily dose.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Embeda was based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. This study, ALO-KNT-301, enrolled subjects with moderate to severe osteoarthritic pain of the hip or knee. The subjects started open-label treatment with Embeda and titrated to effect. Once their pain was controlled (Brief Pain Inventory Average 24-hour Pain Intensity AND at least a 2-point drop from screening baseline), they were randomized to either active treatment with Embeda or were tapered off Embeda using a double-dummy design and placed on placebo. Of these, 75.1% of the randomized subjects were opioid naÃ¯ve and distributed evenly between the 2 groups. The mean change in the weekly diary BPI average pain score from randomization baseline (Visit Y) to the end of study (Visit Y + 12 Weeks/Early Termination) was statistically significantly superior for those treated with Embeda compared to the placebo group.
Ongoing Study Commitments
King Pharmaceuticals has agreed to conduct a deferred pediatric efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic (single- and multiple-dose) study under PREA for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, when a continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time in pediatric patients ages 12 to 17 years.

Embeda is an extended-release oral formulation of morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride. Morphine sulfate is an agonist and naltrexone hydrochloride is an antagonist at the mu-opioid receptor. Morphine produces both its therapeutic and its adverse effects by interaction with one or more classes of specific opioid receptors located throughout the body. Morphine acts as a pure agonist, binding with and activating opioid receptors at sites in the periaqueductal and peri-ventricular grey matter, the ventro-medial medulla and the spinal cord to produce analgesia. Naltrexone is a pure, centrally acting mu-opioid antagonist that reverses the subjective and analgesic effects of mu-opioid receptor agonists by competitively binding at mu-opioid receptors.

Pain,Exalgo (hydromorphone hydrochloride) extended release,"General Information
Exalgo is an extended release formulation of hydromorphone hydrochloride, a Schedule II a mu-opioid agonist. It utilizes the OROS PUSH-PULL osmotic delivery system to release hydromorphone at a controlled rate over an extended period. As an opioid agonist, the principle therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. The precise mechanism of action of opioid analgesics is not known but the effects are thought to be mediated through opioid-specific receptors located predominantly in the central nervous system.
Exalgo is specifically indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain in opioid tolerant patients requiring continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesia for an extended period of time.
Exalgo is supplied as a tablet for orral administration. Dosage should be individualized according to each patient's nneds. The dose range of Exalgo studied in clinical trials was 8 mg to 64 mg. The tablets are to be administered every 24 hours with or without food and all other extended-release opioids should be discontinued.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Exalgo was based in part on a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study in opioid tolerant patients with moderate-to-severe low back pain. The patients were considered opioid tolerant if they were currently on opioid therapy that was â‰¥60 mg/day of oral morphine equivalent for at least 2 months prior to screening. The patients entered an open-label conversion and titration phase with Exalgo, were converted to a starting dose that was approximately 75% of their total daily morphine equivalent dose, and were dosed once daily until adequate pain control was achieved with tolerable side effects. The patients who achieved a stable dose entered a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized treatment phase. Mean daily dose at randomization was 37.8 mg/day. Exalgo provided superior analgesia compared to placebo. There was a significant difference between the mean changes from Baseline to Week 12 or Final Visit in average weekly pain intensity NRS scores obtained from patient diary between the two groups.

Pain,OxyContin (oxycodone HCl controlled-release),"General Information
OxyContin has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, which requires treatment for more than a few days, such as the pain associated with musculoskeletal conditions.
OxyContin tablets are taken every 12 hours. Most pain medications must be taken every three to six hours.
OxyContin is available in four tablet strengths (10, 20, 40, and 80 mg).
OxyContin tablets are available by prescription only. The tablets are to be taken whole. Taking broken, chewed, or crushed tablets could lead to the rapid release and absorption of a potentially toxic dose of oxycodone.
OxyContin is contraindicated in subjects with known hypersensitivity to oxycodone, or in any situation where opioids are contraindicated. This includes subjects with significant respiratory depression (in unmonitored settings or the absence of resuscitative equipment), and subjects with acute or severe bronchial asthma or hypercarbia. OxyContin is contraindicated in any subjects who has or is suspected of having paralytic ileus.
OxyContin, like all opioid analgesics, may cause severe hypotension in an individual whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents which compromise vasomotor tone. OxyContin may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory subjects. OxyContin, like all opioid analgesics, should be administered with caution to subjects in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.
Clinical Results
In clinical trials of OxyContin tablets, involving more than 700 subjects, onset of pain relief occurred within one hour for most subjects.
","Side Effects
The most serious risk associated with opioids, including OxyContin, is respiratory depression. Common opioid side effects are constipation, nausea, sedation, dizziness, vomiting, pruritis, headache, dry mouth, sweating, and weakness.
","Additional Information
Among the most common causes of persistent, debilitating pain are arthritis, lower back conditions, injuries, and cancer. For example, more than eight million Americans are permanently disabled by back pain--with 65,000 new cases diagnosed each year.
In advanced stages of cancer, nearly 75% of cancer subjects have pain that is moderate, severe, or very severe. In earlier stages, 30% to 45% of cancer subjects experience moderate to severe pain.",
Pain,Sprix (ketorolac tromethamine),"General Information
Sprix is an intranasal formulation of Ketorolac, a non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug.
Sprix is specifically indicated for adults for the short term (up to 5 days) management of moderate to moderately severe pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level.
Sprix is supplied as a solution for intranasal inhalation. The total duration of use of Sprix alone or sequentially with other formulations of ketorolac must not exceed 5 days because of the potential for increasing the frequency and severity of adverse reactions associated with the recommended doses. The recommended initial dose of Sprix is as follows:
Adults < 65 Years of Age: 31.5 mg Sprix (one 15.75 mg spray in each nostril) every 6 to 8 hours. The maximum daily dose is 126 mg (four doses).
Reduced Doses for Special Populations; For patients > 65 years of age, renally impaired patients, and adult patients less than 50 kg (110 lbs), the recommended dose is 15.75 mg Sprix (one 15.75 mg spray in only one nostril) every 6 to 8 hours. The maximum daily dose is 63 mg (four doses).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Sprix was based on two multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies for post-operative pain.
Study One
This study enrolled 300 adults who had undergone elective abdominal or orthopedic surgery. The subjects received Sprix or placebo administered every 8 hours and morphine administered via patient controlled analgesia on an as needed basis. Efficacy was demonstrated as a statistically significant greater reduction in the summed pain intensity difference over 48 hours in patients who received Sprix as compared to those receiving placebo. The patients treated with Sprix required 36% less morphine over 48 hours than those treated with placebo.
Study Two
This study enrolled 321 subjects who had undergone elective abdominal surgery. The subjects received Sprix or placebo administered every 6 hours and morphine administered via patient controlled analgesia on an as needed basis. Efficacy was demonstrated as a statistically significant greater reduction in the summed pain intensity difference over 48 hours in patients who received Sprix as compared to those receiving placebo. The patients treated with Sprix required 26% less morphine over 48 hours than those treated with placebo.

Pain,Subsys (fentanyl sublingual spray),"General Information
Subsys is a sublingual spray formulation of fentanyl. Fentanyl is an opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown although fentanyl is known to be a mu-opioid receptor agonist.
Subsys was specifically approved for the management of breakthrough pain in adult cancer patients who are already receiving and who are tolerant to around-the-clock opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain.
Susbsys is supplied as a spray for sublingual administration. Subsys should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes side effects. The initial dose of Subsys to treat episodes of breakthrough cancer pain is always 100 mcg. From this initial dose, the dose should be titrated to provide adequate analgesia using a single Subsys dose per breakthrough cancer pain episode with tolerable side effects. For each breakthrough pain episode treated, if pain is not relieved after 30 minutes, patients may take ONLY ONE additional dose of the same strength for that episode. Thus the maximum of two doses of Subsys is recommended for any breakthrough pain episode. Patients MUST wait at least 4 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough pain with Subsys.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Subsys was based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in opioid tolerant adults with cancer and breakthrough pain. The subjects received Subsys from 100 mcg per dose to 1600 mcg per dose. The study began with an open-label dose titration period followed by a double-blind treatment period. The goal of titration was to find the dose of Subsys that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects. Once a successful dose was established, subjects were enrolled into the double-blind period and randomized to a sequence of 10 treatments; 7 with Subsys and 3 with placebo. The subjects assessed pain intensity on a 100 mm visual analog scale that rated the pain as 0=none to 100=worst possible pain. With each episode of breakthrough pain, pain intensity was assessed first and then treatment was administered. Pain intensity (0-100) was then measured at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after the start of administration. The primary endpoint was the summed pain intensity difference from baseline to 30 minutes after dosing. Out of 130 subjects who entered the titration phase, 98 (75%) were able to titrate to a dose that adequately reduced pain with tolerable side effects and entered into the double-blind period. Subsys produced a statistically significantly greater reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo as measured by the Summed Pain Intensity Differences scale (SPID) at 30 minutes.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Subsys may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Pain,Targiniq ER (oxycodone hydrochloride + naloxone hydrochloride) extended-release tablets,"General Information
Targiniq is a combination product consisting of oxycodone, an opioid agonist, and naloxone, an opioid antagonist.
Targiniq ER is specifically indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. It is not indicated for use as-needed (prn) analgesic. Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release opioid formulations, reserve Targiniq ER for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequete.
Targiniq ER is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. For opioid-naÃ¯ve and opioid non-tolerant patients, initiate with 10 mg/5 mg tablets orally every 12 hours.
Crushing, chewing, or dissolving Targiniq ER tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can lead to overdose or death.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Targiniq ER was based on one 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in opioid-experienced patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe chronic low back pain. A total of 1,095 subjects with uncontrolled moderate to severe chronic low back pain entered an open-label, dose-titration period for up to four weeks. Patients initiated Targiniq ER therapy at an oxycodone dose approximately equivalent to their current therapy. The dose of Targiniq ER could be up-titrated to a maximum of 40/20 mg twice daily by the investigator every 1-2 days as needed based on efficacy, safety, and tolerability considerations or down-titrated at any time for safety and/or tolerability reasons. During open-label titration, subjects were allowed supplemental pain medication (immediate-release oxycodone HCl 5 mg capsules) for low back pain every 4 hours as needed up to 8 capsules per day. Fifty-five percent (55%) of patients who entered the open-label titration period achieved adequate analgesia and tolerability on TARGINIQ ER and were then randomized to their final titrated dose of Targiniq ER or matching placebo for 12 weeks of double-blind treatment. During the double-blind period, subjects were allowed one capsule of supplemental pain medication as needed, up to two capsules per day. Of the 298 patients randomized to Targiniq ER, 73% of the patients completed the 12-week double-blind treatment on study drug. Of the 302 patients randomized to placebo, 60% of the patients completed the study. Fewer patients randomized to Targiniq ER discontinued due to lack of efficacy compared to placebo, 10% versus 24%. Discontinuation due to adverse events was the same for both groups. The mean score of average pain over the last 24 hours at the end of the study (Week 12/Early Termination) was statistically significantly lower in patients treated with Targiniq ER compared to patients treated with placebo. A higher proportion of patients treated with Targiniq ER (55%) had at least a 30% reduction in pain score from screening to week 12 compared to placebo patients (41%). Also, a higher proportion of patients treated with Targiniq ER (37%) had at least a 50% reduction in pain score from screening to week 12 compared to placebo patients (25%).

Pain,Tivorbex (indomethacin),"General Information
Tivorbex (indomethacin) is a submicron particle, low dose formulation of indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic and analgesic properties.
Tivorbex is specifically indicated for treatment of mild to moderate acute pain in adults.
Tivorbex is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended dose is 20 mg orally three times daily or 40 mg orally two or three times daily. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Tivorbex was based on two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm studies comparing Tivorbex 20 mg three times daily, 40 mg twice daily, 40 mg three times daily, and placebo in patients with pain following bunionectomy (Study 1 and Study 2). The two studies enrolled a total of 835 subjects with a minimal pain intensity rating of at least 40 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) during the 9-hour period after discontinuation of the anesthetic block following bunionectomy surgery. The mean pain intensity measured by VAS at baseline for all treatment groups in both studies ranged from 71 to 74 mm. One tablet of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10 mg/325 mg was permitted every 4 to 6 hours as rescue medication. There was a greater use of concomitant opioid rescue medication in the placebo-treated arm than in the Tivorbex-treated arms. In Study 1, 89% of subjects in the Tivorbex 20 mg three times daily group, 90% of the subjectsin the Tivorbex4 40 mg twice daily group, 82% in the Tivorbex 40 mg three times daily group, and 97% of subjects in the placebo group took rescue medication for pain management during the study. In Study 2, 87% of subjects in the Tivorbex 20 mg three times daily group, 76% of the subjects in the Tivorbex 40 mg twice daily group, 80% in the Tivorbex 40 mg three times daily group, and 89% of subjects in the placebo group took rescue medication for pain management during the study.

Pain,Ultracet (acetaminophen and tramadol HCl),"General Information
Ultracet has been approved by the FDA for the short-term (five days or less) management of acute pain. This medication is a centrally acting analgesic that controls pain through different mechanisms of action than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the most commonly used pain medications. As a result, Ultracet is not associated with the side effects that can result from NSAID use, such as gastrointestinal ulcers or bleeding.
Ultracet combines Ultram (tramadol HCl), a leading prescription pain reliever, with the common non-prescription pain treatment, acetaminophen. Clinical trials have shown that the combination is more effective than either drug alone, providing longer duration than acetaminophen and a faster onset of action than tramadol.
Clinical Results
Ultracet has been evaluated for efficacy and safety in pivotal single-dose trials in subjects with acute pain. In these trials, subjects with pain following oral surgical procedures who received two tablets of Ultracet experienced greater relief than placebo-treated subjects. Additionally, subjects treated with Ultracet experienced greater relief than subjects on either of the individual components given at the same dose. The onset of pain relief after Ultracet (occurring in less than one hour) was faster than with tramadol alone, whereas the duration of pain relief after Ultracet was longer than with acetaminophen alone. Analgesia was found to be generally comparable to ibuprofen.
","Side Effects
Side effects reported with Ultracet include constipation, somnolence (sleepiness) and increased sweating.
Ultracet should not be used concomitantly with alcohol. Since tramadol can reinitiate physical dependence, Ultracet is not recommended for subjects disposed to drug or alcohol abuse.
Seizures have been reported in subjects receiving tramadol treatment. Data indicates that the risk of seizures is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Tramadol use has been shown to increase seizure risk in subjects taking the following medications:
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
Tricyclic antidepressants
Opioids
Additionally, tramadol may enhance the risk of seizures in subjects taking the following:
MAO inhibitors
Neuroleptics
Other drugs that reduce the seizure threshold
As with any medication, please consult a physician to discuss possible adverse effects or contraindications.
","Additional Information
For additional information on Ultracet, please visit Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical.","Mechanism of Action
Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M1 metabolite to mu-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.
Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M1 to mu-opioid receptors. In animal models, M1 is up to six times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in mu-opioid binding. Tramadol-induced analgesia is only partially antagonized by the opiate antagonist naloxone in several animal tests. The relative contribution of both tramadol and M1 to human analgesia is dependent upon the plasma concentrations of each compound.
Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics. These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.
Acetaminophen is a non-opiate, non-salicylate analgesic. (from Ultracet Prescribing Information)

c.
Xartemis XR is specifically indicated for the management of acute pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.
Xartemis XR is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is 2 tablets every 12 hours administered with or without food. The second dose of 2 tablets may be administered as early as 8 hours after the initial dose if patients require analgesia at that time. Subsequent doses are to be administered 2 tablets every 12 hours. The tablets should be swallowed whole, one at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in mouth. Do not break, chew, crush, cut, dissolve or split the tablets. Breaking, chewing, crushing, cutting, dissolving or splitting Xartemis XR tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can lead to overdose or death.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xartemis XR was based on a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel arm multi dose study comparing Xartemis XR and placebo in 303 subjects with acute pain following a unilateral first metatarsal bunionectomy. All subjects met the criteria of pain intensity >4 on a 0 to 10 numerical pain rating scale and received a fixed-dose of 2 tablets of Xartemis XR (7.5 mg oxycodone hydrochloride and 325 mg acetaminophen) tablets or placebo every 12 hours over 48 hours. Ibuprofen 400 mg every 4 hours as needed was allowed as rescue medication. Mean baseline pain intensity scores were 6.2 in the Xartemis XR group and 6.0 in the placebo group. Approximately 85% of the 150 subjects treated with Xartemis XR and 98% of the 153 subjects treated with placebo took rescue medication at least once for pain management during the 48 hours after the first dose. Rescue medication was used by less than 50% of the Xartemis XR-treated patients after the first dose interval. Pain intensity was recorded at 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours after each dose, with additional recordings at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes after the first dose. The median time to onset of pain relief was less than one hour for Xartemis XR. The primary endpoint was the summed pain intensity difference (change in pain from baseline) over 48 hours (SPID48), which demonstrated improvement in pain from baseline for the Xartemis XR treatment group compared to placebo.

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Zohydo ER was based on a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial in opioid-experienced subjects with moderate to severe chronic low back pain. A total of 510 subjects currently on chronic opioid therapy entered an open-label conversion and titration phase (up to 6 weeks) with Zohydro ER dosed every 12 hours at an approximated equianalgesic dose of their pre-study opioid medication. For inadequately controlled pain, Zohydro ER was increased by 10 mg per 12-hour dose, once every 3 to 7 days until a stabilized dose was identified, or a maximum dosage of 100 mg every 12 hours. There were 302 subjects (59%) randomized at a ratio of 1:1 into a 12-week double-blind treatment phase with their fixed stabilized dose of Zohydro ER (40 to 200 mg daily taken as 20 to 100 mg, every 12 hours) or a matching placebo. Subjects randomized to placebo were given a blinded taper of Zohydro ER according to a pre-specified tapering schedule. During the Treatment Phase, subjects were allowed to use rescue medication (hydrocodone 5 mg/500 mg acetaminophen) up to 2 doses (2 tablets) per day. There were 124 treated subjects (82%) that completed the 12Â­week treatment with Zohydro ER and 59 subjects (39%) with placebo. Zohydro ER provided greater analgesia compared to placebo. There was a significant difference in the mean changes from Baseline to Week 12 in average weekly pain intensity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores between the two groups.

A second study followed subjects treated with Gemzar who had previously been treated with 5-FU.
The Phase III study of Gemzar involved 126 pancreatic cancer subjects--63 of these subjects received Gemzar therapy and the other 63 subjects received treatment with 5-FU. Of these subjects, more than 70% entered the study with metastatic disease, the most advanced stage of pancreatic cancer. Gemzar demonstrated a statistically significant advantage in survival over 5-FU. Gemzar subjects had a 5.7 month median survival as compared with 4.2 months for 5-FU subjects. From this trial, the six-month probability estimate for survival of subjects treated with Gemzar is 46% (30 patients), compared with 29% (19 subjects) for 5-FU subjects. After one year, the survival probability estimate was 18% (9 subjects) for Gemzar subject, compared with 2% (two subjects) for 5-FU subjects. (Survival probability estimates take results from the clinical trial and, using a mathematical equation, generalize them to the larger population of pancreatic cancer subjects.)
This study also demonstrated that 24% of previously untreated subjects who received Gemzar experienced a clinical benefit response, compared with 5% of subjects treated with 5-FU. This difference also is statistically significant.
A phase II trial of Gemzar, conducted among 63 subjects who had previously been treated with 5-FU, showed median survival time of 3.9 months. In this trial, 87% of subjects entered the study with metastatic disease. Of these subjects, 31% survived for six months, and 4% survived for one year. In addition, clinical benefit response was observed in 27% of subjects.
","Side Effects
Gemzar's side effects were generally manageable with less than 1% of subjects discontinuing their therapy for any of the following side effects. A decrease in some infection-fighting white blood cells, called neutropenia, was observed in 63% of subjects, with moderate to severe decreases in 25% of subjects. This effect on the blood was the most frequent reason for reducing or limiting the dose of Gemzar. Common adverse effects in clinical trials included nausea and vomiting (69%), fever (41%), edema or fluid retention (up to 34%), rash (30%), and flu-like symptoms (19%). Only about 10% of all subjects participating in Gemzar clinical trials discontinued therapy due to side effects.
Hair loss was reported in 15% of subjects. This side effect was reversible, and none of the subjects experienced complete hair loss from their treatment.
","Additional Information
Pancreatic cancer, one of the most difficult cancers to treat, is hard to detect because subjects remain asymptomatic until late in the course of the disease. Currently, less than 10% of all pancreatic cancer patients live more than one year after diagnosis. An estimated 26,000 people in the United States will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 1996.
Given the difficulty in diagnosing pancreatic cancer, traditional means for establishing the activity of a chemotherapy agent, such as the rate of tumor growth or shrinkage, often cannot provide a useful measurement of a drug's effectiveness. Recognizing the unique needs associated with caring for pancreatic cancer patients, Lilly designed a clinical endpoint that would provide an objective, quantitative measurement of Gemzar's effect on several important disease-related symptoms experienced by subjects.
Clinical benefit response is a measure of symptomatic improvement based on the following: level of pain; consumption of pain medication; ability to perform daily activities; weight change. Subjects were considered to be clinical benefit responders only if they experienced improvement in at least one measurement without deterioration in any of the others. This improvement must have reached an established level for at least four consecutive weeks.","Mechanism of Action
Gemzar is a nucleoside analogue that mimics a natural building block of DNA.

Pancreatic Cancer,Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate),"General Information
Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate) is a radiolabeled somatostatin analog.
Lutathera is specifically indicated for the treatment of somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) including foregut, midgut, and hindgut neuroendocrine tumors in adults.
Lutathera is supplied as an injection for intravenous administration. The recommended dose is 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) every 8 weeks for a total of 4 doses. Please see drug label for premedication and use with concomitant medications.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Lutathera was based on results of a randomized pivotal Phase III study, NETTER-1 that compared treatment using Lutathera plus best standard of care (octreotide LAR 30mg every four weeks) to 60 mg of octreotide LAR alone (also dosed every four weeks) in patients with inoperable midgut NETs progressing under standard dose octreotide LAR treatment and overexpressing somatostatin receptors. The NETTER-1 study met its primary endpoint, showing a 79% reduction in risk of disease progression or death in the Lutathera arm compared to the 60 mg octreotide LAR arm (p<0.0001). Median PFS was not reached in the Lutathera arm compared to 8.5 months for the 60 mg octreotide LAR arm. A pre-planned interim overall survival analysis determined that Lutathera treatment lead to a 48% reduction in the estimated risk of death compared to treatment with 60 mg octreotide LAR. The objective response rate, composed of complete and partial responses, was 13% for the Lutathera arm compared to 4% in the Octreotide LAR 60mg arm (p<0.0148).

Pancreatic Cancer,Lynparza (olaparib),"General Information
Lynparza (olaparib) is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor.
Lynparza is specifically indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as detected by an FDA-approved test, whose disease has not progressed on at least 16 weeks of a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen.
Lynparza is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is 300 mg taken orally twice daily, with or without food until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Clinical Data
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Lynparza for pancreatic cancer was based on POLO, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial that randomized (3:2) 154 patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to olaparib 300 mg orally twice daily or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The main efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review using RECIST 1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR). Median PFS was 7.4 months for patients who received olaparib compared with 3.8 months for patients who received placebo. Median OS for olaparib and placebo was 18.9 months and 18.1 months, respectively; ORR among patients who had measurable disease at baseline was 23% and 12%, respectively.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Lynparza or pancreatic cancer please visit the Lynparza web page.","Mechanism of Action
Lynparza is an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, including PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3. PARP enzymes are involved in normal cellular homeostasis, such as DNA transcription, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair. Olaparib has been shown to inhibit growth of select tumor cell lines in vitro and decrease tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer both as monotherapy or following platinum-based chemotherapy. Increased cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity following treatment with olaparib were noted in cell lines and mouse tumor models with deficiencies in BRCA. In vitro studies have shown that olaparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complex, resulting in disruption of cellular homeostasis and cell death.

Pancreatic Cancer,Onivyde (irinotecan liposome injection),"General Information
Onivyde (irinotecan liposome injection) is a topoisomerase inhibitor.
Onivyde is specifically indicated in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy.
Onivyde is supplied as an injection for intravenous infusion. Administer Onivyde prior to leucovorin and fluorouracil. The recommended dose of Onivyde is 70 mg/m2 administered by intravenous infusion over 90 minutes every 2 weeks. Increase the dose of Onivyde to 70 mg/m2 as tolerated in subsequent cycles.
Please see drug label for dosing in specific populations and for dose modifications.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Onivyde was based on a three-arm, randomized, open-label trial in 417 patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with documented disease progression, after gemcitabine or gemcitabine-based therapy. Subjects were were randomized to receive Onivyde plus fluorouracil/leucovorin (Onivyde/5-FU/LV), Onivyde, or fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV). Randomization was stratified by ethnicity (White vs. East Asian vs. other), KPS (70-80 vs. 90-100), and baseline albumin level (â‰¥ 4 g/dL vs. 3.0-3.9 g/dL). Patients randomized to Onivyde/5-FU/LV received Onivyde 70 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes, followed by leucovorin 400 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 minutes, followed by fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 intravenously over 46 hours, every 2 weeks. The Onivyde dose of 70 mg/m2 is based on irinotecan free base (equivalent to 80 mg/m2 of irinotecan as the hydrochloride trihydrate). Patients randomized to Onivyde as a single agent received Onivyde 100 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes every 3 weeks. Patients randomized to 5-FU/LV received leucovorin 200 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 minutes, followed by fluorouracil 2000 mg/m2 intravenously over 24 hours, administered on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 6-week cycle. Patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele initiated Onivyde at a reduced dose (50 mg/m2 Onivyde if given with 5-FU/LV or 70 mg/m2 Onivyde as a single agent). The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) with two pair-wise comparisons: Onivyde versus 5-FU/LV and Onivyde/5-FU/LV versus 5-FU/LV. The study showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival for the Onivyde/5-FU/LV arm over the 5-FU/LV arm. There was no improvement in overall survival for the Onivyde arm over the 5-FU/LV arm.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Onivyde or hyperkalemia, please visit https://www.onivyde.com/","Mechanism of Action
Onivyde (irinotecan liposome injection) is a topoisomerase inhibitor encapsulated in a lipid bilayer vesicle or liposome. Topoisomerase 1 relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind reversibly to the topoisomerase 1-DNA complex and prevent re-ligation of the single-strand breaks, leading to exposure time-dependent double-strand DNA damage and cell death. In mice bearing human tumor xenografts, irinotecan liposome administered at irinotecan HCl-equivalent doses 5-fold lower than irinotecan HCl achieved similar intratumoral exposure of SN-38.

Children Older than 12 Months and Younger than 4 Years
Enzyme dosing should begin with 1,000 lipase units/kg of body weight per meal for children less than age 4 years to a maximum of 2,500 lipase units/kg of body weight per meal (or less than or equal to 10,000 lipase units/kg of body weight per day), or less than 4,000 lipase units/g fat ingested per day.
Children 4 Years and Older and Adults
Enzyme dosing should begin with 500 lipase units/kg of body weight per meal for those older than age 4 years to a maximum of 2,500 lipase units/kg of body weight per meal (or less than or equal to 10,000 lipase units/kg of body weight per day), or less than 4,000 lipase units/g fat ingested per day.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Pancreaze was based on two studies conducted in 57 subjects with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) associated with cystic fibrosis (CF).
Study One
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 40 subjects, ages 8 to 57 years. The subjects received Pancreaze at individually titrated doses (not to exceed 2,500 lipase units per kilogram per meal) for 14 days (open label period) followed by randomization to Pancreaze or matching placebo for 7 days of treatment (double-blind withdrawal period). Only patients with coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) >80% in the open label period were randomized to the double-blind withdrawal period. All subjects consumed a high-fat diet (greater than or equal to 100 grams of fat per day) during the treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in CFA from the open label period to the end of the double-blind withdrawal period. The CFA was determined by a 72-hour stool collection period during both treatment period. At the end of the double-blind withdrawal period, the mean change in CFA from the open label period to the end of the double-blind withdrawal period was -2% with Pancreaze treatment compared to -34% with placebo treatment.
Study Two
This randomized, investigator-blinded, dose-ranging study of 17 patients, ages 6 months to 30 months. All subjects were transitioned from their usual PEP treatment to Pancreaze at 375 lipase units per kilogram body weight per meal for a 6 day run-in period. Patients were then randomized to receive Pancreaze at one of four doses (375, 750, 1,125, and 1,500 lipase units per kilogram body weight per meal) for 5 days. The CFA was measured at the end of the run-in period and at the end of the randomized period. Overall, patients showed similar CFA at the end of the run-in period (mean Pancreaze dose of 1,600 lipase units per kilogram body weight per day) as at the end of the study across the four treatment arms. Change in CFA (%) Day 6 to Day 11: -2 , 1, -1, -2, respectively.

Pancreatic Disorders,SecreFlo (secretin),"General Information
SecreFlo is a synthetic version of the intestinal hormone secretin. This product has been approved by the FDA for use in stimulating pancreatic secretions, including bicarbonate, to aid in the diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine dysfunction. Additionally, SecreFlo is approved for use in stimulating gastrin secretion to aid in the diagnosis of gastrinoma, a tumor usually found in the pancreas.
Clinical Results
Intravenous administration of SecreFlo stimulates the pancreas to secrete pancreatic juice, which can aid in the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. Three crossover studies evaluated 21 subjects with a history of chronic pancreatitis. In these trials, SecreFlo was compared to biologically derived porcine secretin (bPS). Results demonstrated that all subjects - treated with either drug - had peak bicarbonate concentrations of less than 80 mEq/L, which is consistent with impaired pancreatic function.
Intravenously administered SecreFlo has been shown to stimulate gastrin secretion in patients with gastrinoma; in contrast, secretion is not considerably increased in healthy individuals or those with peptic ulcer disease. Two SecreFlo crossover studies included eight subjects with tissue-confirmed gastrinoma. Subjects received treatment with SecreFlo, and serum gastrin concentrations were compared to those obtained with bPS. Results showed that for both drugs, serum gastrin concentrations exceeded 100 pg/mL from basal levels.

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Zenpep was based on the results of two clinical studies in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) associated with cystic fibrosis (CF).
Study One
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study enrolled 34 patients, ages 7 to 23 years. Results are from 32 subjects who completed both double-blind treatment periods, and were included in the efficacy analysis population. The subjects were randomized to receive Zenpep or matching placebo for 6 to 7 days of treatment, followed by crossover to the alternate treatment for an additional 6 to 7 days. The mean dose during the controlled treatment periods ranged from a mean dose of 3,900 lipase units per kilogram per day to 5,700 lipase units per kilogram per day. All patients consumed a high-fat diet (greater than or equal to 100 grams of fat per day) during the treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean difference in the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) between Zenpep and placebo treatment. Mean CFA was 88% with Zenpep treatment compared to 63% with placebo treatment. The mean difference in CFA was 26 percentage points in favor of Zenpep treatment (p<0.001). Subgroup analyses of the CFA results showed that mean change in CFA was greater in patients with lower no-treatment (placebo) CFA values than in patients with higher no-treatment (placebo) CFA values.

Autoimmune pancreatitis,Viokace (pancrelipase) tablets,,,,
Panic Disorders,Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride),"General Information
Paxil has been approved for the treatment of panic disorder, a disabling condition that will affect three to six million Americans at some time in their lives. Paxil belongs to a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
For many years, the only drug indicated for panic disorder was the benzodiazepine tranquilizer alprazolam. However, alprazolam is associated with dependence and is not indicated for long-term treatment of this chronic condition. Paxil has not been associated with the development of dependence in clinical trials and is indicated for long-term treatment of panic disorder.
In addition, alprazolam is not indicated for major depression, and as many as 65% of patients with panic disorder may also suffer from depression. Paxil is indicated for the treatment of depression as well as panic disorder.
For the treatment of panic disorder, the recommended target dose of Paxil is 40 mg per day. The starting dose is 10 mg per day, and dosage should not exceed 60 mg per day. Paxil is available in 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg tablets.
Paxil has also been approved as treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts that are intrusive and inappropriate, as well as distressing or anxiety-provoking. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors such as hand-washing or mental acts such as repeating words silently, and are aimed at reducing the distress or preventing some dreaded event.
The recommended dosage of Paxil in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder is 40 mg daily. The starting dose is 20 mg per day, and dosage should not exceed 60 mg per day.
Clinical Results
In one 10-week double-blind clinical study, 76% of subjects treated with 40 mg per day of Paxil were completely free of full panic attacks at the end point, compared with 44% of subjects who received placebo. Patients who responded to Paxil during the initial 10-week phase and a three-month double-blind extension phase were randomly assigned to continue on Paxil or be switched to placebo for an additional three months. Of the subjects switched to placebo, 30% experienced a relapse, as compared with only 5% of those who were treated with Paxil.
Paxil is the only SSRI that has demonstrated long-term maintenance of efficacy in a six-month relapse-prevention clinical trial. This is important because OCD is a chronic condition and often requires long-term treatment.
","Side Effects
Paxil was well tolerated in clinical trials for panic disorder and OCD. Side effects with an incidence of 10% or greater and at least twice that of placebo were sleepiness, nausea, abnormal ejaculation, dry mouth, constipation, dizziness, and tremor.
","Additional Information
Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden, unprovoked episode in which sufferers experience physical symptoms such as racing, pounding heartbeat, chest pain, breathlessness, and choking and may fear they are losing control or are in imminent danger of dying. Panic disorder is diagnosed when a person has:
persistent anxiety about having another attack
concern over the implications of the attacks or their consequences, including fear of life-threatening illness or ""losing control""
behavioral changes due to the attacks, including avoidance of everyday activities
Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from panic disorder, and the most common age of onset is the late teens and early twenties. Yet, panic attacks and panic disorder are found in people of all ages. Despite its prevalence, panic disorder is under diagnosed, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, which estimates that only one out of three panic disorder sufferers has been correctly diagnosed and treated.",
Panic Disorders,Paxil CR (paroxetine hydrochloride),"General Information
Paxil CR, a controlled-release tablet, is approved for the treatment of panic disorder. Paxil CR was previously approved in March 1999 as a treatment for major depressive disorder.
Depression affects close to 20 million Americans and is the most common serious brain disease in the United States. A major depressive episode is defined as experiencing five of the following depressive symptoms within a two week period: persistent sad mood, diminished interest in previously enjoyable activities, changes in weight or appetite, difficulty sleeping, agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired concentration and suicidal thoughts.
In a given year, panic disorder affects approximately 2.5 million Americans between the ages of 18 and 54. Half of those inflicted develop the condition prior to age 24 and women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed. Panic disorder is characterized by unexpected and repeated attacks of intense fear in combination with four of the following symptoms: chest pain, heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, a choking sensation, nausea, dizziness, distortions of reality, fear of losing control, fear of dying, numbness and chills or hot flashes.
Clinical Results
Approval of Paxil CR is supported by results from two placebo-controlled studies with subjects diagnosed with major depressive disorder and three flexible-dose studies with subjects with panic disorder. Paxil CR was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in all studies except the third study for treatment of panic disorder.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Paxil CR may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Abnormal ejaculation
Abnormal vision
Constipation
Somnolence
Decreased libido
Sweating
Female genital disorders
","Additional Information
For additional information on Paxil CR, please visit GlaxoSmithKline.","Mechanism of Action
Paxil CR (paroexetine hydrochloride) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with a chemical structure unrelated to that of other such drugs. The effectiveness of Paxil CR in the treatment of depression and panic disorder seems to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from the inhibition of neuronal uptake of serotonin.

Panic Disorders,Zoloft (sertraline HCl),"General Information
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Zoloft for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder in children ages 6 to17 years of age. Zoloft has already been approved for treatment of panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults.",,,
Panic Disorders,Zoloft (sertraline HCl),"General Information
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared Pfizer to market Zoloft (sertraline HCl) for the treatment of panic disorder. Zoloft also received new labeling for maintaining antidepressant efficacy for up to 52 weeks in the treatment of depression. Zoloft was introduced for the treatment of depression in 1992 and, in 1996, for obsessive-compulsive disorder. The new clearance specifies that Zoloft may be marketed for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia.
Clinical Results
In clinical trials with adult patients, Zoloft demonstrated significant reduction in frequency of panic attacks without regard to age, gender or race. Patients suffering from panic disorder experience recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. The more common symptoms include heart palpitations, sensations of shortness of breath, dizziness and fear of losing control or going crazy. Panic attacks, or the fear of them, can also result in worry, concern or even dramatic behavioral and lifestyle changes.
","Side Effects
The most common side effects were diarrhea, ejaculation failure, tremor, constipation, agitation, increased sweating, anorexia, and decreased libido.
","Additional Information
Panic disorders is a disease which will afflict an estimated four to eight million American adults at some point in their lives. Agoraphobia is an incapacitating anxiety that can restrict people to their homes. Panic disorder is two to three times more prevalent among women. Onset occurs between late adolescence and the mid-30s.",
Parasitic infections,Albenza (albendazole),"General Information
Albenza has been approved for the treatment of two parasitic infections caused by worms:
Hydatid cyst disease of the liver, lung, and peritoneum, caused by the larval form of the dog tapeworm, Echinococcus granulosus
Neurocysticercosis caused by larval forms of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium
For hydatid disease, the recommended dose for Albenza is 400 mg twice daily with meals for three cycles (each cycle consists of 28 days of dosing followed by a 14-day albendazole-free interval). For neurocysticercosis, the recommended dose is 400 mg twice daily for eight to 30 days.
Albendazole was first marketed outside the United States in 1982 for human use where it is currently marketed under the trade names of Zentel and Eskazole.
Clinical Results
Subjects treated with Albenza have shown improvement in more than 80% of the neurocysticercosis subjects and cure or improvement in up to 70%of the hydatid subjects.
","Side Effects
Side effects were usually mild and resolved without treatment. The most frequently reported side effects by hydatid disease subjects included abnormal liver function, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting; those reported by neurocysticercosis subjects included headache, nausea, and vomiting.
","Additional Information
E. granulosus is considered endemic in the Western US sheep-raising areas of Utah, Arizona, and Nevada, but the vast majority of cases occur in new immigrants who have been exposed to the infection years previously in their countries of origin, or in travelers from the United States to endemic areas. Most cysts are found in the liver where, after remaining asymptomatic for decades, they finally produce abdominal pain or a mass. The incidence of hydatid disease in the United States is estimated to be between 100 and 200 new cases diagnosed annually.
T. solium cysticercosis is rare in the United States except in immigrants from endemic areas. It is most common in Latin America, Asia, Russia, and Eastern Europe and is caused by inadequately cooked or raw infected pork. Infection with the adult worm is usually asymptomatic. Severe larval infection, a result of ingestion of contaminated material, may cause muscle pains, weakness, or fever. It can also cause epileptic seizures. The incidence of neurocysticercosis is estimated to be less than 1,000 new cases diagnosed annually.
Worldwide, the prevalence of hydatid disease is estimated to be about one million people mostly found in herding and animal-raising countries and regions of North West China, parts of Northern and Southern Africa, East Africa, Iraq, the Mediterranean basin, Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile. It also occurs occasionally in other countries including the United States, Great Britain, South and East Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The prevalence of neurocysticercosis is estimated to be about 1.5 million people worldwide. In both diseases, infection with the larva is accidental and transmission from human-to-human does not normally occur.",
Parasitic infections,Coartem (artemether/lumefantrine),"General Information
Coartem is a fixed dose oral combination of artemether (20 mg), an artemisinin derivative, and lumefantrine (120 mg), two anti-malarials.
Coartem is specifically indicated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated malaria infections due to Plasmodium falciparum in patients of 5 kg bodyweight and above.
Coartem is supplied as a tablet designed for oral administration. Coartem tablets should be taken with food. In the event the patient is unable to swallow the tablets, such as infants and children, the tablets may be crushed and mixed with a small amount of water. The recommended initial dose of the drug is as follows:
Adults (aged 16 years and above)
A 3-day treatment schedule with a total of 6 doses is recommended for adult patients with a bodyweight of 35 kg and above. The tablets should be administered the following way: four tablets as a single initial dose, four tablets again after 8 hours and then four tablets twice daily (morning and evening) for the following two days (total course of 24 tablets). For patients weighing less than 35 kg, see the sosage for pediatrics.
Pediatrics (below 16 years of age)
A 3-day treatment schedule with a total of 6 doses is recommended as below:
5 kg to less than 15 kg bodyweight: one tablet as an initial dose, one tablet again after 8 hours and then one tablet twice daily (morning and evening) for the following two days (total course of 6 tablets); 15 kg to less than 25 kg bodyweight: two tablets as an initial dose, two tablets again after 8 hours and then two tablets twice daily (morning and evening) for the following two days (total course of 12 tablets); 25 kg to less than 35 kg bodyweight: three tablets as an initial dose, three tablets again after 8 hours and then three tablets twice daily (morning and evening) for the following two days (total course of 18 tablets); 35 kg bodyweight and above: four tablets as a single initial dose, four tablets again after 8 hours and then four tablets twice daily (morning and evening) for the following two days (total course of24 tablets).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Coartem was based on 8 clinical studies. The studies enrolled HIV-negative subjects with acute, uncomplicated malaria caused by P. falciparum, in China, Thailand, sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and South America. The studies include two 4-dose studies assessing the effcacy of the components of the regimen, a study comparing a 4-dose versus a 6-dose regimen, and 5 additional 6-dose regimen studies. Coartem Tablets were administered at 0, 8, 24, and 48 hours in the 4-dose regimen, and at 0, 8, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours in the 6-dose regimen. The efficacy endpoints included the following: 28-day cure rate, defined as clearance of asexual parasites (the erythrocytic stage) within 7 days without recrudescence by day 28, parasite clearance time (PCT), defined as time from first dose until first total and continued disappearance of asexual parasite which continues for a further 48 hours, and fever clearance time (FCT), defined as time from first dose until the first time body temperature fell below 37.5Â°C and remained below 37.5Â°C for at least a further 48 hours (only for patients with temperature:; 37.5Â°C at baseline).
Studies 1 and 2
These randomized, double-blind, comparative, single center studies assessed the efficacy of Coartem tablets (4 doses of 4 tablets of 20 mg artemether/120 mg lumefantrine) compared to each component alone. Data supported that the combination of artemether and lumefantrine in Coartem Tablets had a significantly higher 28-day cure rate compared to artemether and had a significantly faster parasite clearance time (p< 0.001) and fever clearance time (p< 0.05) compared to lumefantrine.
Study 3
This randomized, double-blind, two-center study was conducted in Thailand in adults and children (aged two years and above), which compared the 4-dose regimen (administered over 48 hours) of Coartem Tablets to a 6-dose regimen (administered over 60 hours). Twenty-eight day cure rate in modified intent-to-treat subjects was 81% for the Coartem Tablets 6-dose arm as compared to 71% in the 4-dose arm.
Studies 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8
In all these studies Coartem Tablets were administered as the 6 dose regimen.
Study 4
This study enrolled 150 adults and children aged 2 years and above in Thailand. In the evaluable population (148 subjects): the 28-day cure rate was 97%; the median fever clearance time (FCT) was 22 hours and the median parasite clearance time (PCT) was not available.
Study 5
This study enrolled 164 adults and children in Thailand. In the evaluable population (155 subjects): the 28-day cure rate was 95.5%; the median fever clearance time (FCT) was 29 hours and the median parasite clearance time (PCT) was 29 hours.
Study 6
This study enrolled 165 non-immune adults residing in regions non-endemic for malaria (Europe and Colombia) who contracted acute uncomplicatedfalciparum malaria when traveling in endemic regions. In the evaluable population (119 subjects): the 28-day cure rate was 96%; the median fever clearance time (FCT) was 37 hours and the median parasite clearance time (PCT) was 42 hours.
Study 7
This African study enrolled 310 infants and children aged 2 months to 9 years, weighing 5 kg to 25 kg, with an axillar temperature ~7.5 Â°C. In the evaluable population (267 subjects): the 28-day cure rate was 89%; the median fever clearance time (FCT) was 8 hours and the median parasite clearance time (PCT) was 24 hours.
Study 8
This African study enrolled 452 infants and children, aged 3 months to 12 years, weighing 5 kg to 35 kg, with fever (greater than 37.5Â°C axillary or greater than 8Â°C rectally) or history of fever in the preceding 24 hours. In the evaluable population (370 subjects): the 28-day cure rate was 88.3%; the median fever clearance time (FCT) was 8 hours and the median parasite clearance time (PCT) was 35 hours.
P. falciparum infections mixed with P. vivax
Of the 43 patients with mixed infections at baseline, all cleared their parasitemia within 48 hours. However, parasite relapse occurred commonly (14/43; 33%). Relapsing malaria caused by P. vivax requires additional treatment with other antimalarial agents to achieve radical cure.

For additional information regarding Coartem or malaria, please visit the Coartem web page.","Mechanism of Action
Coartem is a fixed dose oral combination of artemether (20 mg), an artemisinin derivative, and lumefantrine (120 mg), two anti-malarials. Both components are blood schizontocides. Aremether is rapidly metabolized into an active metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA). The anti-malarial activity of artemether and DHA has been attributed to endoperoxide moiety. The exact mechanism by which lumefantrine, exerts its anti-malarial effect is not well defined. However, available data suggests lumefantrine inhibits the formation of ÃŸ-hematin by forming a complex with hemin.

Parasitic infections,Egaten (triclabendazole),"General Information
Egaten (triclabendazole) is an anthelmintic against Fasciola species.
Egaten is specifically indicated for the treatment of fascioliasis in patients 6 years of age and older.
Egaten is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is 2 doses of 10 mg/kg given 12 hours apart in patients 6 years of age and older. The 250 mg tablets are functionally scored and divisible into two equal halves of 125 mg. If the dosage cannot be adjusted exactly, round the dose upwards. Take Egaten orally with food. The tablets can be swallowed whole or divided in half and taken with water or crushed and administered with applesauce. The crushed tablet mixed with applesauce is stable for up to 4 hours.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Egaten was based on the following:
An open label, randomized trial, conducted in Vietnam compared the efficacy of triclabendazole (two 10 mg/kg doses given 12 hours apart with food) to oral artesunate (4 mg/kg, given once daily for 10 days). One hundred patients (age range: 9-74 years) with acute symptomatic fascioliasis were randomized, 50 in each treatment group. At 3 months after treatment, 92% and 76% of patients in the triclabendazole and artesunate arms respectively, reported no clinical symptoms.
The clinical development program of triclabendazole for the treatment of fascioliasis included 6 nonrandomized, open label studies performed in Cuba, Bolivia, Peru, Chile, and Iran in a total of 245 adult and pediatric patients with stool-confirmed fascioliasis. All studies were similar in design. The studied triclabendazole doses ranged from 5 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg administered on days 1-3. Cure was defined as absence of Fasciola eggs in the stool based on the Kato-Katz method at Day 60 in patients who were positive at baseline. Across these studies, there was a finding of a dose response. Specifically, the Day 60 cure rate was highest for the 20 mg/kg dose, which was given in 2 divided doses, followed by cure rates of 88%, 80% and 50% in the 15 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 5 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. The 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 15 mg/kg dosing regimens are not approved.

Parasitic infections,"Tindamax, tinidazole","General Information
Tindamax tablets contain the antimicrobial agent tinidazole, a second generation synthetic nitroimidazole. The drug has activity against many species of infectious protozoals, including those which sexually transmitted and water borne. It was designed to be effective in the short term, with treatment usually ranging from just a single dose to as long as 3 days.
Tinidazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of the following protozoal infections
Trichomoniasis caused by T. vaginalis in both male and female patients
Giardiasis caused by G. duodenalis\G. lamblia)
Amebiasis and amebic liver abscess caused by E. histolytica
Tindamax is supplied as an oral tablet at one of two dosing stregths (250 and 500 mg), and is designed to be taken with food. For trichomoniasis and giardiasis, recommended dosage is a single dose of 2 g. For amebiasis/amebic abscess, recommended dosage is 2 g once daily for three days. Pediatric doses should be adjusted by patient weight at 50 mg/kg, up to 2 g total dose.
Clinical Results
Approval of Tindamax for trichomoniasis was based on the combined results of 34 studies involving over 2,800 subjects. 4 blinded, randomized, comparative studies in which the 2 g single oral dose was used assessed efficacy by culture at time points post-treatment ranging from one week to one month. Reported cure rates ranged from 92% (37/40) to 100% (65/65) (n=172 total subjects). 4 blinded, randomized, comparative studies assessed efficacy by wet mount between 7-14 days post-treatment. Reported cure rates ranged from 80% (8/10) to 100% (16/16) (n=116 total subjects). In these studies, tinidazole was superior to placebo and comparable to other anti-trichomonal drugs. The single oral 2 g tinidazole dose was also assessed in 4 open label trials in men (one comparative to metronidazole and 3 single arm studies). Parasitological evaluation of the urine was performed both pre- and post-treatment, and reported cure rates ranged from 83% (25/30) to 100% (80/80) (n=142 total subjects).
Approval for giardias was based on 19 studies involving 1,600 adult and pediatric subjects. In eight controlled studies involving a total of 619 subjects, of whom 299 were given the 2 g (50 mg/kg in pediatric patients) single oral dose of tinidazole, reported cure rates ranged from 80% (40/50) to 100% (15/15). In three of these trials where the comparator was 2 to 3 days of various doses of metronidazole, reported cure rates for metronidazole were 76% (19/25) to 93% (14/15). Data comparing a single 2 g dose of tinidazole to the recommended 5-7 days of metronidazole are limited.
Approval for amebiasis was based on 26 reported studies involving over 1,400 subjects. The majority of studies investigated the 2 g daily oral dose for 3 days. In four randomized, controlled studies (1 investigator single-blind, 3 open-label)using this dose, reported cure rates after three days among 220 subjects ranged from 86% (25/29) to 93% (25/27). Approval for amebic liver abscess was based on 18 reported studies treating a total of 470 subjects. Subjects in these studies received the 2 g oral dose for 2-5 days. In 7 randomized, controlled studies (1 double-blind, 1 single-blind, 5 open-label) at that dose, (with additional aspiration of the liver abscess when clinically necessary), reported cure rates among 133 subjects ranged from 81% (17/21) to 100% (16/16); 4 of these studies utilized at least 3 days of tinidazole.

Parathyroid Disorders,Parsabiv (etelcalcetide),"General Information
Parsabiv (etelcalcetide) is a calcium-sensing receptor agonist.
Parsabiv is specifically indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adult patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis.
Parsabiv is supplied as an injection for intravenous administration. Prior to Parsabiv administration, dose increase, or re-initiation, ensure corrected serum calcium is at or above the lower limit of normal. The recommended starting dose of Parsabiv is 5 mg administered by intravenous (IV) bolus injection three times per week at the end of hemodialysis treatment. The maintenance dose of Parsabiv is individualized and determined by titration based on parathyroid hormone (PTH) and corrected serum calcium response. The maintenance dose is the dose that maintains PTH levels within the recommended target range and corrected serum calcium within the normal range. The lowest maintenance dose of Parsabiv is 2.5 mg three times per week, and the highest maintenance dose of Parsabiv is 15 mg three times per week.
Administer Parsabiv only at the end of hemodialysis treatment. If a regularly scheduled hemodialysis treatment is missed, do not administer any missed doses. Resume Parsabiv at the end of the next hemodialysis treatment at the prescribed dose. If doses of Parsabiv are missed for more than 2 weeks, re-initiate Parsabiv at the recommended starting dose of 5 mg (or 2.5 mg if that was the patientâ€™s last dose).
Please see drug label for specific monitoring and dose requirement instructions.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Parsabiv was based on two 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. An aggregate of 1,023 patients with moderate-to-severe secondary HPT (PTH greater than 400 pg/mL) on hemodialysis were randomized to receive intravenous Parsabiv or placebo three times a week, at the end of their dialysis sessions in addition to standard of care that could include vitamin D and/or phosphate binders. The primary endpoint of both studies was the proportion of patients achieving greater than 30 percent reduction from baseline in PTH during the Efficacy Assessment Phase (EAP), defined as weeks 20 through 27. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with PTH less than or equal to 300 pg/mL during the EAP; and percent reductions in PTH, albumin-adjusted calcium (cCa), phosphate (P) and cCa x P during the EAP. The two studies showed that significantly more Parsabiv than placebo patients, respectively, achieved:
A greater than 30 percent reduction from baseline in PTH during the EAP: 77% versus 11% in Study 1, and 79% versus 11% in Study 2
PTH levels of 300 pg/mL or less during the EAP: 52% versus 6% in Study 1, and 56% versus 5% in Study 2
Additionally, greater percent reduction from baseline was achieved in Parsabiv-treated patients than placebo-treated patients during the EAP, for PTH, corrected calcium and phosphate in both studies.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Parsabiv may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Parathyroid Disorders,Rayaldee (calcifediol),"General Information
Rayaldee (calcifediol) is a vitamin D3 analog.
Rayaldee is specifically indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease and serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL.
Rayaldee is supplied as an extended release capsule for oral administration. The initial recommended dose of Rayaldee is 30 mcg administered orally once daily at bedtime. Serum calcium should be below 9.8 mg/dL before initiating treatment. Monitor serum calcium, phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) 3 months after starting therapy or changing dose. Increase the dose to 60 mcg once daily after 3 months if intact PTH is above the treatment goal. Ensure serum calcium is below 9.8 mg/dL, phosphorus is below 5.5 mg/dL and 25-hydroxyvitamin D is below 100 ng/mL before increasing the dose. Suspend dosing if intact PTH is persistently abnormally low, serum calcium is consistently above the normal range or serum 25Â­ hydroxyvitamin D is consistently above 100 ng/mL
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Rayaldee was based on two identical multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease and serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 10 and 30 ng/mL. Subjects were stratified by chronic kidney disease stage and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive Rayaldee or a matching placebo at bedtime over 26 weeks. The dose of Rayaldee was 30 mcg once daily for the first 12 weeks and either 30 or 60 mcg once daily for the last 14 weeks. The dose was increased to 60 mcg at the start of week 13 if the plasma intact PTH level was greater than 70 pg/mL, the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was less than 65 ng/mL and the serum calcium level was less than 9.8 mg/dL. A total of 213 subjects were randomized in one trial and 216 subjects were randomized in the second trial. The primary analysis compared the proportion of individuals who experienced an at least 30% reduction in plasma intact PTH from baseline to end of trial (average of weeks 20, 22, 24 and 26). A larger proportion of patients randomized to Rayaldee experienced an at least 30% reduction in plasma intact PTH from baseline compared to placebo in both trials [33% versus 8% in the first trial (P<0.001) and 34% versus 7% in the second trial (P<0.001)]. Serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels increased to at least 30 ng/mL in 80% and 83% of subjects treated with RAYALDEE vs. 3% and 7% of subjects treated with placebo (P<0.001) in the two studies, respectively. Average steadystate 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were 50 and 56 ng/mL for subjects receiving 30 mcg daily, and 69 and 67 ng/mL for subjects receiving 60 mcg daily, in the first and second studies, respectively.

Parkinson's Disease,Apokyn (apomorphine hydrochloride),"General Information
Apokyn (apomorphine) is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist. Formulations of apomorphine have been available since the 1970s in Europe and Canada, but Apokyn represents the first time any drug containing apomorphine has been approved for use in the US. It is indicated for the treatment of motor symptoms associated with late stage Parkinson's Disease.
It is specifically indicated for the acute, intermittent treatment of hypomobility, ""off"" episodes (""end-of-dose wearing off"" and unpredictable ""on/off"" episodes) associated with advanced Parkinsonâ€™s disease, as adjunct/supplemental therapy to standard levodopa therapy. It is the first treatment approved for this indication in the US.
The recommended subcutaneous dose of Apokyn is 0.2 to 0.6 mL subcutaneously during acute hypomobility episodes, delivered via metered injector pen. Average dosing frequency during study was thrice daily, with a maximum studied regimen of 0.6 mL five times daily. Recommended application is to a pinch of skin on the upper arm, thigh or abdomen.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Apokyn for the treatment of acute Parkinsonian hypomobility was based on three randomized, controlled studies, enrolling a total of 108 subjects, all of whom had advanced Parkinson's disease (mean disease duration = 11.3 years) and were being treated with L-dopa and at least one other agent, usually a dopamine agonist. Improvement in motor function on the Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was the primary endpoint of all three studies. The trials enrolled a combined total of 108 subjects, including 29 (one trial) who had never received apomorphine products (the remaining 79 subjects had experience internationally with apomorphine). Results showed that Apokyn was significantly efficacious in ending hypomotor episodes and markedly impoving UPDRS motor scores (> 20 points mean improvement for all trials) 20 minutes after dosing, compared with placebo (p<0.0001 for all trials). 98% of all trial subjects began antiemetic treatment with Tigan (trimethobenzamide) 3 days prior to treatment; roughly 50% were able to eventually disontinue Tigan while continuing Apokyn treatment (mean time to discontinuation = 2 months).
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Apokyn may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Yawning
Dyskinesias
Drowsiness/Somnolence
Dizziness/Postural Hypotension
Rhinorrhea
Hallucinations
Edema/Inflammation
In addition, Apokyn has been associated with a very high incidence on mild-to-moderate treatment-responsive nausea and/or vomiting, especially early in treatment while the subject is still acclimating to Apokyn. It is recommended that subjects begin antiemetic treatment with or just prior to treatment with Apokyn, and continue for as long as needed.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Apokyn or hypomotor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's Disease, please contact the Apokyn Web Site","Mechanism of Action
Apokyn injection delivers apomorphine hydrochloride hemihydrate, a non-ergoline dopamine agonist with high selectivity for the dopamine D4, D2, D3, D5 and adrenergic alpha-1D, alpha-2B, alpha-2C receptors, all of which are broadly associated with the promotion of motor function. The precise mechanism of action of Apokyn as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown, although it is believed to be due to stimulation of post-synaptic D2 receptors within the caudate putamen, a brain stucture which supports motor function. Subcutaneous administration provides rapid, controlled systemic delivery, with linear pharmacokinetics over a doses ranging of 2 to 8 mg.

Parkinson's Disease,Comtan,"General Information
This new treatment in the management of idiopathic Parkinson's Disease helps prolong the effects of the levodopa/carbidopa preparations, such as improved motor performance and increased amounts of ""on"" time (periods of good function and mobility in which a patient is able to perform common daily activities such as walking, speaking, and writing).
Comtan belongs to a class of therapeutic treatments called COMT inhibitors which block the COMT enzyme. When taken with the prescribed levodopa/carbidopa treatment, the inhibitor reduces the breakdown of levodopa before it reaches the brain. As a result, the effects of each levodopa dose are extended and enhanced.
Clinical Results
The effects of Comtan were tested on nearly 700 patients in worldwide, multi-center trials. Compared to a placebo, patients with Parkinson's who took Comtan demonstrated improved motor performance and had significantly increased amounts of ""on"" time each day. Several important Phase III studies indicated that the benefits were salient for patients who showed deteriorating response to levodopa/carbidopa, particularly in important activities of daily living such as speaking, handwriting, walking and dressing.
","Side Effects
Comtan is generally well-tolerated and doesn't require any specific safety monitoring. The most commonly reported side-effects were dyskinesia, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain and urine discoloration. A very small percentage of participants in the trials also experienced hallucinations. Dopaminergic side effects like dyskinesia often improved after adjustment of the levodopa dosage.
","Additional Information
For more information about Comtan, call 1-888-669-6682.
Visit the Novartis web site: www.us.novartis.com","Mechanism of Action
Entacapone inhibits COMT and alters the plasma pharmokinetics of levodopa. When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone. It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The higher levodopa levels also lead to increased levodopa adverse effects, sometimes requiring a decrease in the dose of levodopa. (FDA Label)
"
Parkinson's Disease,Duopa (carbidopa and levodopa) enteral suspension,"General Information
Duopa is an enteral suspension of carbidopa and levodopa. Carbidopa inhibits the decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa, making more levodopa available for delivery to the brain.
Duopa is specifically indicated for the treatment of motor fluctuations in patients with advanced Parkinsonâ€™s disease.
Duopa is supplied as a solution for enteral infusion. Duopa is administered over a 16-hour infusion period. The maximum recommended daily dose of Duopa is 2000 mg of levodopa (i.e., one cassette per day) administered over 16 hours. Prior to initiating Duopa, convert patients from all forms of levodopa to oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa tablets. Titrate total daily dose based on clinical response for the patient. Administer Duopa into the jejunum through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal tube (PEG-J). Please see drug label for specific dosing instructions.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Duopa was based on a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active controlled, parallel group, 12-week study in 66 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were levodopa-responsive and had persistent motor fluctuations while on treatment with oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa and other Parkinson's disease medications. Patients were eligible for participation in the studies if they were experiencing 3 hours or more of â€œOffâ€� time on their current Parkinson's disease drug treatment and they demonstrated a clear responsiveness to treatment with levodopa. Patients were randomized to either Duopa and placebo capsules or placebo suspension and immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa 25/100 mg capsules. Patients in both treatment arms had a PEG-J device placement. Duopa or placebo-suspension was infused over 16 hours daily. The mean daily levodopa dose was 1117 mg/day in the Duopa group and 1351 mg/day in the oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa group. The clinical outcome measure in Study 1 was the mean change from baseline to Week 12 in the total daily mean â€œOffâ€� time, based on a Parkinson's disease diary. The ""Off"" time was normalized to a 16-hour awake period. The mean score decrease (i.e., improvement) in â€œOffâ€� time from baseline to Week 12 for Duopa was significantly greater (p=0.0015) than for oral immediate release carbidopa-levodopa. Additionally, the mean score increase (i.e., improvement) in â€œOnâ€� time without troublesome dyskinesia from baseline to Week 12 was significantly greater (p=0.0059) for Duopa than for oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa. The treatment difference (Duopa â€“ oral immediate release carbidopa-levodopa) for decrease in â€œOffâ€� time was approximately 1.9 hours and the treatment difference for the increase in â€œOnâ€� time without troublesome dyskinesia was approximately 1.9 hours.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Duopa may include, but are not limited to. the following:
complication of device insertion
nausea
depression
peripheral edema
hypertension
upper respiratory tract infection
oropharyngeal pain

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Duopa or advanced Parkinson's disease, please visit https://www.duopa.com/","Mechanism of Action
Duopa is an enteral suspension of carbidopa and levodopa. Carbidopa: When levodopa is administered orally, it is rapidly decarboxylated to dopamine in extracerebral tissues so that only a small portion of a given dose is transported unchanged to the central nervous system. Carbidopa inhibits the decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa, making more levodopa available for delivery to the brain. Levodopa: Levodopa is the metabolic precursor of dopamine, does cross the blood-brain barrier, and presumably is converted to dopamine in the brain. This is thought to be the mechanism whereby levodopa treats the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson's Disease,Exelon (rivastigmine tartrate),"General Information
Exelon (rivastigmine tartrate) is a cholinesterase inhibitor. The exact mechanism of rivastigmine's action is unknown, however it is thought to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. It inhibits the cholinesterase enzyme from breaking down acetylcholine, increasing both the level and duration of action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.
Exelon is specifically indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimerâ€™s type and for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinsonâ€™s disease.
Exelon patch is supplied as a 4.6 mg or 9.5 mg patch designed for transdermal administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 4.6 mg/24 hours. If treatment is well tolerated after a minimum of four weeks, this dose should be increased to 9.5 mg/24 hours, the recommended effective dose.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Exelon was based on the results of a single controlled trial in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease as well as on three controlled trials of the immediate release capsule in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and one controlled trial in dementia associated with Parkinsonâ€™s Disease.
International 24-Week Study of Exelon Patch
This randomized, double-blind trial enrolled 1,195 subjects who were placed in one of the following cohorts: Exelon Patch 9.5 mg/24 hours; Exelon Patch 17.4 mg/24 hours; Exelon capsules 6 mg BID or placebo, for 24 weeks. The trial was divided into a 16-week titration phase followed by an 8-week maintenance phase. The primary endpoints included improvement from baseline in cognitive performance, assessed with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) as well as the ability of Exelon patch to produce an overall clinical effect, assessed using the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Cooperative Study - Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). At 24-weeks the differences in the mean ADAS-Cog change scores for the Exelon-treated subjects compared to the subjects on placebo, were 1.8, 2.9, and 1.8 units for the Exelon Patch 9.5 mg/24 hours, Exelon Patch 17.4 mg/24 hours, and Exelon capsule 6 mg BID groups, respectively. The mean differences in the ADCS-CGIC scores for the comparison of subjects in each of the Exelon-treated groups with the subjects on placebo, was 0.2 units. Both endpoints reached statistical significance compared to placebo.

Exelon (rivastigmine tartrate) is a cholinesterase inhibitor. The exact mechanism of rivastigmine's action is unknown, however it is thought to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. Thus, rivastigmineâ€™s effect may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.

Parkinson's Disease,Neupro (rotigotine),"General Information
Neupro is a transdermal delivery system that provides rotigotine, a non-ergolinic dopamine agonist, continuously over a 24-hour period. The exact mechanism of action of rotigotine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is unknown.
Neupro is specifically indicated for the the treatment of the signs and symptoms of early-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
Neupro is supplied as a patch in 2, 4, and 6 mg strengths designed for transdermal administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 2 mg/24 hours. Based on individual response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased weekly by 2 mg/24 hours if tolerated and additional therapeutic effect is needed. The lowest effective dose was found to be 4 mg/24 hours. The highest recommended dose is 6 mg/24 hours. The discontinuation of Neupro should be done gradually. The daily dose should be reduced by 2 mg/24 hours with a dose reduction preferably every other day, until complete withdrawal.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Neupro was based on the results of three clinical studies. These parallel group, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies enrolled subjects internationally. All subjects were not receiving concomitant dopamine agonist therapy and were either L-dopa naÃ¯ve or off L-dopa for at least 28 days prior to baseline and were never on L-dopa for more than 6 months. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline for the combined scores for Part II (activities of daily living component) plus part III (motor component) of the Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).
Dose Response Study
This randomized, double-blind, dose-response trial enrolled 316 early stage Parkinson's subjects. Subjects received either placebo or one of several fixed doses (2 mg/24 hours, 4 mg/24 hours, 6 mg/24 hours, or 8 mg/24 hours) of Neupro, given as 1, 2, 3, or 4 2-mg patches for a period up to 11 weeks. Subjects underwent a weekly titration over four weeks. They then continued on treatment for a 7 week maintenance phase followed by a down titration during the last week. Mean baseline combined UPDRS scores were similar among all treatment groups, between 27.1 and 28.5. Subjects experienced a mean improvement in the combined UPDRS from baseline to end of treatment of -3.5, -4.5, -6.3, and -6.3 for the 2 mg/24 hours, 4 mg/24 hours, 6 mg/24 hours, and 8 mg/24 hours Neupro groups respectively and -1.4 for the placebo group. Statistical significance was observed at the three highest doses.
North American Study
This randomized, double-blind trial enrolled 277 early stage, idiopathic Parkinson's Disease subjects who were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive Neupro (2, 4, or 6 mg/24 hours) or placebo for 28 weeks. Subjects underwent a weekly titration over 3 weeks to a maximal dose of 6 mg/24 hours depending on efficacy and tolerability, and then received treatment over a 24 week maintenance phase followed by a de-escalation over a period up to 4 days. Mean baseline combined UPDRS was similar in both groups, 29.9 for the Neupro group and 30.0 for placebo. Statistical significance was reached in the Neupro treated subjects versus placebo in the mean change in the combined UPDRS from baseline to end of treatment ( -4.0 versus +1.39, respectively).
Foreign Multinational Study
This randomized, double-blind trial, three arm, parallel group, double-dummy trial enrolled 561 subjects with early stage Parkinson's Disease. Subjects were assigned to treatment with either placebo, Neupro (2 mg/24 hours, 218 4 mg/2 hours, 6 mg/24 hours, or 8 mg/24 hours) or active oral comparator in a ratio of 1: 2: 2 for a period of up to 39 weeks. Subjects underwent a weekly dose escalation of patch (consisting of 2 mg/24 hours increments of Neupro or placebo) and a dose escalation of capsules of comparator or placebo over 13 weeks up to a maximal dose of 8 mg/24 hours of Neupro. Subjects randomized to Neupro achieved the maximal dose of 230 mg/24 hours after a 4 week titration if maximal efficacy and intolerability had not occurred over a 4 week titration period. Subjects then received treatment over a 24 week maintenance phase followed by a de-escalation over a period up to 12 days. Mean baseline combined UPDRS was similar across all groups (33.2 Neupro, 245 31.3 placebo, 32.2 comparator). Neupro treated subjects experienced a mean change in the combined UPDRS from baseline to end of treatment of - 6.83, and placebo treated subjects showed a mean change from baseline of - 2.33, a statistically significant difference.

Neupro is a transdermal delivery system that provides rotigotine, a non-ergoline D3/D2/D1 dopamine agonist, continuously over a 24-hour period. The exact mechanism of action of rotigotine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is unknown. However, it is thought to be related to its ability to stimulate dopamine D2 receptors within the caudate-putamen in the brain.

Nuplazid is specifically indicated for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinsonâ€™s disease psychosis.
Nuplazid is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose of Nuplazid is 34 mg, taken orally as two 17 mg strength tablets once daily, without titration. Nuplazid can be taken with or without food.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Nuplazid was based on a 6-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. In this outpatient study, 199 patients were randomized to Nuplazid 34 mg or placebo once daily. Study patients (male or female and aged 40 years or older) had a diagnosis of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) established at least 1 year prior to study entry and had psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and/or delusions) that started after the PD diagnosis and that were severe and frequent enough to warrant treatment with an antipsychotic. At entry, patients were required to have a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score â‰¥21 and to be able to self-report symptoms. The majority of patients were on PD medications at entry; these medications were required to be stable for at least 30 days prior to study start and throughout the study period. The PD-adapted Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS-PD) was used to evaluate the efficacy. A negative change in score indicates improvement. Primary efficacy was evaluated based on change from baseline to Week 6 in SAPS-PD total score. Nuplazid 34 mg (n=95) was statistically significantly superior to placebo (n=90) in decreasing the frequency and/or severity of hallucinations and delusions in patients with PDP as measured by central, independent, and blinded raters using the SAPS-PD scale.

All Parkinson's patients should be informed that syncope or symptomatic hypotension may occur more frequently during initial treatment, and hallucinations can occur at any time during the course of treatment.",,
Parkinson's Disease,Rytary (carbidopa and levodopa) extended-release capsules,"General Information
Rytary is an extended release formulation of carbidopa and levodopa. Carbidopa is an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid decarboxylation and levodopa is an aromatic amino acid. Carbidopa inhibits the decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa, making more levodopa available for delivery to the brain.
Rytary is specifically indicated for the treatment of Parkinsonâ€™s disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication or manganese intoxication.
Rytary is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. Rytary should be swallowed whole with or without food. A high-fat, high-calorie meal may delay the absorption of levodopa by about 2 hours. The recommended starting dosage in levodopa-naÃ¯ve patients is 23.75 mg / 95 mg taken orally three times a day for the first 3 days. On the fourth day of treatment, the dosage of Rytary may be increased to 36.25 mg / 145 mg taken three times a day.
Based upon individual patient clinical response and tolerability, the Rytary dose may be increased up to a maximum recommended dose of 97.5 mg / 390 mg taken three times a day. The dosing frequency may be changed from three times a day to a maximum of five times a day if more frequent dosing is needed and if tolerated. The maximum recommended daily dose of Rytary is 612.5 mg / 2450 mg. Maintain patients on the lowest dosage required to achieve symptomatic control and to minimize adverse reactions.
For the conversion of patients from immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa to Rytary, please see the drug label.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Rytary was based on two trials in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease in the U.S. and in Europe.
Study 1 (APEX-PD)
APEX-PD enrolled and randomized 381 levodopa-naive patients. The study met its primary efficacy endpoint of mean change from baseline in the sum of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II (activities of daily living) score and UPDRS Part III (motor skills) score for Rytary versus placebo at Week 30 (or early termination).
Study 2 (ADVANCE-PD)
ADVANCE-PD enrolled 393 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease having ""off"" time. The results showed treatment with Rytary reduced the percentage of ""off"" time (36.9% to 23.8%) from baseline versus immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa (36.0% to 29.8%) during waking hours to end of study. Rytary also increased ""on"" time without troublesome dyskinesia during waking hours versus baseline to end of study by 1.8 hours. Less ""off"" time was primary related to more ""on"" time without troublesome dyskinesia.
","Side Effects

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Rytary or Parkinson's disease, please visit http://www.rytary.com/","Mechanism of Action
Rytary is an extended release formulation of carbidopa and levodopa. Carbidopa: When levodopa is administered orally, it is rapidly decarboxylated to dopamine in extracerebral tissues so that only a small portion of a given dose is transported unchanged to the central nervous system. Carbidopa inhibits the decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa, making more levodopa available for delivery to the brain. Levodopa: Levodopa is the metabolic precursor of dopamine, does cross the blood-brain barrier, and presumably is converted to dopamine in the brain. This is thought to be the mechanism whereby levodopa relieves symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

The most common reported side effects included dyskinesias (involuntary movements), nausea, sleep disorders, dystonia, anorexia, diarrhea, somnolence, excessive dreaming, muscle cramps, orthostatic complaints/syncope, dizziness, headache, hallucination and confusion.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Although the precise mechanism of action is unknown, it is believed that COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase) inhibitors work to enhance the effectiveness of levodopa by blocking one of the main enzymes responsible for breaking down levodopa in the bloodstream, before it reaches the brain. By inhibiting the action of the COMT enzyme, Tasmar provides a smoother and more sustained level of levodopa to the brain."
Parkinson's Disease,Xadago (safinamide),"General Information
Xadago (safinamide) is a monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor.
Xadago is specifically indicated as adjunctive treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) experiencing â€œoffâ€� episodes.
Xadago is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended starting dosage is 50 mg administered orally once daily (at the same time of day), without regard to meals. After two weeks, the dosage may be increased to 100 mg once daily, based on individual need and tolerability. Daily dosages of Xadago above 100 mg have not been shown to provide additional benefit, and higher dosages increase the risk for adverse reactions. Xadago has been shown to be effective only in combination with levodopa/carbidopa. If a dose is missed, the next dose should be taken at the same time the next day. Xadago 100 mg should be tapered by decreasing the dose to 50 mg for one week before stopping.

The FDA approval of Xadago was based on two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national, 24-week studies (Study 1 and Study 2) conducted in PD patients experiencing â€œOFFâ€� Time during treatment with carbidopa/levodopa and other PD medications. In both studies, the primary measure of effectiveness was the change from baseline in total daily â€œONâ€� Time without troublesome dyskinesia, based on 18-hour diaries completed by patients for at least 3 days before each of the scheduled visits. Secondary endpoints included â€œOFFâ€� Time during the diary period and reduction in Uniform Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III (motor examination). In Study 1, 645 subjects were randomized equally to treatment with Xadago 50 mg/day (n=217 patients), Xadago 100 mg/day (n=216 patients), or placebo (n=212 patients), and had at least one post-baseline assessment of â€œONâ€� Time. Xadago 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day significantly increased â€œONâ€� Time compared to placebo. The increase in â€œONâ€� Time without troublesome dyskinesia was accompanied by a similar significant reduction in â€œOFFâ€� Time and a reduction in UPDRS III scores assessed during â€œONâ€� Time. Improvement in â€œON Timeâ€� occurred without an increase in troublesome dyskinesia. In Study 2 549 subjects were randomized to treatment with Xadago 100 mg daily (n=274 patients) or placebo (n=275 patients) for up to 24 weeks. Xadago was significantly better than placebo for increasing â€œONâ€� Time. The observed increase in â€œONâ€� Time without troublesome dyskinesia was accompanied by a reduction in â€œOFFâ€� Time of similar magnitude and a reduction in UPDRS III score (assessed during â€œONâ€� Time). As in Study 1, the increase in â€œONâ€� Time without troublesome dyskinesia was accompanied by a similar significant reduction in â€œOFFâ€� Time and a reduction in Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS III) scores assessed during â€œONâ€� Time.

Asparlas is an asparagine specific enzyme. L-asparaginase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the amino acid L-asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia. The pharmacological effect of Asparlas is thought to be based on selective killing of leukemic cells due to depletion of plasma L-asparagine. Leukemic cells with low expression of asparagine synthetase have a reduced ability to synthesize L-asparagine, and therefore depend on an exogenous source of L-asparagine for survival.

The total daily dose for pediatrics 2 to 12 years of age is 5mg/kg to 8mg/kg orally administered in two divided doses separated by approximately 12 hours, for a duration of 60 days. Please see drug label for specific dosing based on weight.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of benznidazole was based on two adequate and well-controlled trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2): Trial 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in children 6 to 12 years of age with chronic indeterminate Chagas disease conducted in Argentina. The chronic indeterminate form of Chagas disease includes patients with serologic evidence of T. cruzi infection without symptoms of cardiac or gastrointestinal disease. A total of 106 patients were randomized to receive either benznidazole (5 mg/kg/day for 60 days) or placebo and followed for 4 years. Patients with at least two positive conventional serologic tests for antibodies to T. cruzi were included in the study. The conventional serologic tests used include indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA), immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA), and/or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and were based on the detection of antibodies against T. cruzi parasites. Trial 2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients 7 to 12 years of age with chronic indeterminate Chagas disease conducted in Brazil. A total of 129 patients were randomized to receive either benznidazole (7.5 mg/kg/day for 60 days) or placebo and followed for 3 years. Patients with three positive conventional serologic tests for antibodies to T. cruzi were included in the study. The conventional serologic tests include IHA, IFA, and/or ELISA and were based on the detection of antibodies against T. cruzi parasites. In the first trial, approximately 60% of children treated with benznidazole had an antibody test change from positive to negative compared with about 14% of who received a placebo. In the second trial approximately 55% of children treated with benznidazole had an antibody test change from positive to negative compared with 5% who received a placebo.

Benznidazole is a nitroimidazole antimicrobial. Benznidazole inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins within the T. cruzi parasite. Studies suggest that benznidazole is reduced by a Type I nitroreductase (NTR) enzyme of T. cruzi producing a series of short-lived intermediates that may promote damage to several macromolecules including DNA. In mammalian cells, however, benznidazole is metabolized by reduction of the nitro group to an amino group by a Type II NTR enzyme. The precise mechanism of action is not known.

Pediatric Health,Bexsero (Meningococcal Group B Vaccine),"General Information
Bexsero is a multicomponent Meningococcal Serogroup B vaccine.
Bexsero is specifically indicated for active immunization to prevent invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. Bexsero is approved for use in individuals 10 through 25 years of age.
Bexsero is supplied as a solution for intramuscular administration. Bexsero should be administer in two doses (0.5 mL each) at least 1 month apart.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Bexsero was based on three studies conducted in Canada, Australia, Chile, and the United Kingdom in approximately 2,600 adolescents and young adults. Among subjects who received two doses of Bexsero, after vaccination, 62 to 88% had antibodies in their blood that killed three different N. meningitidis serogroup B strains in tests carried out in a laboratory, compared with 0 to 23% before vaccination. These three strains are representative of strains that cause serogroup B meningococcal disease in the U.S.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Bexsero may include, but are not limited to, the following:
pain at the injection site
myalgia
erythema
fatigue
headache
induration
nausea
arthralgia
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Bexsero or invasive meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B, please visit http://www.bexsero.com/","Mechanism of Action
Bexsero is a multicomponent Meningococcal Serogroup B vaccine. NHBA, NadA, fHbp, and PorA are proteins found on the surface of meningococci and contribute to the ability of the bacterium to cause disease. Vaccination with Bexsero leads to the production of antibodies directed against NHBA, NadA, fHbp, and PorA P1.4. The susceptibility of serogroup B meningococci to complement-mediated antibodydependent killing following vaccination with Bexsero is dependent on both the antigenic similarity of the bacterial and vaccine antigens, as well as the amount of antigen expressed on the surface of the invading meningococci.

Pediatric Health,Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA),"General Information
Botox for injection is a sterile, vacuum-dried purified botulinum toxin type A, produced from fermentation of Hall strain Clostridium botulinum type A. Botox blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to acceptor sites on motor or sympathetic nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter in both the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system and causes the activation of muscle movement.
Among other indications, Botox has been approved specifically for upper limb spasticity in adult patients, to decrease the severity of increased muscle tone in elbow flexors, wrist flexors and finger flexors. Botox was subsequently approved in June of 2019 for patients ages 2 to 17 years with upper limb spasticity.
Botox is supplied as a vacuum-dried powder for reconstitution with sterile, non-preserved Sodium Chloride Injection. It is supplied as single-use 50 Unit and 100 Unit vials. Dosing of Botox for upper limb spasticity in initial and sequential treatment sessions should be tailored to the individual based on the size, number and location of muscles involved, severity of spasticity, the presence of local muscle weakness, the patient's response to previous treatment, or adverse event history with Botox. The recommended initial doses are as follows:
Biceps Brachii:100 - 200 Units divided in 4 sites
Flexor Carpi Radialis: 12.5 - 50 Units in 1 site
Flexor Carpi Ulnaris: 12.5 - 50 Units in 1 site
Flexor Digitorum Profundus: 30 - 50 Units in 1 site
Flexor Digitorum Sublimis: 30 - 50 Units in 1 site
The recommended dose in children per treatment session is 3 Units per kilogram to 6 Units per kilogram divided among affected muscles of the upper limb. The total dose in pediatric patients should not exceed 8 Units per kilogram body weight or 300 Units, whichever is lower, in a 3-month interval.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The efficacy and safety of Botox for the treatment of upper limb spasticity was evaluated in three randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Efficacy was measured according to the The Ashworth Scale, a clinical measure of the force required to move an extremity around a joint, with a reduction in score clinically representing a reduction in the force needed to move a joint. Possible scores range from 0 (no increase in muscle tone) to 4 (limb rigid in flexion or extension- very severe)
Study One
This trial enrolled 126 patients with upper limb spasticity who were at least 6 months post-stroke. Botox (a total dose of 200 Units to 240 Units) and placebo were injected intramuscularly into the flexor digitorum profundus, flexor digitorum sublimis, flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, and if necessary into the adductor pollcis and flexor pollcis longus. The subjects were followed for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was wrist flexors muscle tone at week 6. The median change from baseline was -2.0 for the Botox arm compared to 0.0 for the placebo arm (pâ‰¤0.05). The median change from baseline in muscle tone for Finger Flexor was -1.0 for the Botox arm and 0.0 for the placebo arm (pâ‰¤0.05). The median change from baseline for thumb flexor muscle tone was -1.0 for both arms.
Study Two
This study compared three doses of Botox (360 Units, 180 Units or 90 Units) with placebo in 91 patients with upper limb spasticity who were at least 6 weeks post-stroke. Botox and placebo were injected into the flexor digitorum profundus, flexor digitorum sublimis, flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, and biceps brachii. The primary efficacy variable in Study 2 was the wrist flexor tone at Week 6. The median change from baseline was -1.5. -1.0. -1.5 for the three Botox arms (90, 180 and 360 Units) respectively and -1.0 for the placebo arm (pâ‰¤0.05). Key secondary endpoints including Physician Global Assessment, finger flexors muscle tone, and elbow flexors muscle tone were also reached.
Study Three
This study compared three doses of Botox (360, 180 or 90 Units) with placebo in 88 patients with upper limb spasticity at least 6 months post-stroke. The primary efficacy variable was wrist and elbow flexor tone. The median change from baseline on the wrist flexor muscle tone was -1.0, -1.0, -1.5 for Botox 90, 180 and 360 Units, respectively and -0.5 for placebo (pâ‰¤0.05 for Botox 360 Units vs. placebo). The median change from baseline for elbow flexor muscle tone was -0.5, -0.5 and -1.0 for the three Botox arms, respectively, and -0.5 for the placebo arm (pâ‰¤0.05 for Botox 360 Units vs. placebo). The key secondary endpoint, mean change in finger flexor tone, was also reached with statistical significance.
The FDA approval of Botox in pediatrics with upper limb spasticity was based on two trials. A placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of onabotulinumtoxinA in children 2 to 16 years of age with upper limb spasticity included 235 patients who were randomized to one intramuscular injection of onabotulinumtoxinA 3 units/kg or 6 units/kg, or placebo. Both active treatment groups demonstrated a significant reduction in Modified Ashworth Scaleâ€�Bohannon scores compared to placebo (onabotulinumtoxinA 6 units/kg, - 1.87; onabotulinumtoxinA 3 units/kg, -1.92; P <.001). The improvement was significant at all assessments during the 12-week trial. An open-label study for upper limb spasticity included 222 subjects. This study focused on safety, with the primary outcome being the percentage of patients reporting at least one adverse event over the course of 60 weeks. The open-label trial for lower limb spasticity followed 350 participants and had the same primary outcome.
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions associated with the use of Botox for upper limb spasticity may include, but are not limited to, the following:
pain in extremity
bronchitis
fatigue
nausea
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Botox or upper limb spasticity, please visit the Botox web page.","Mechanism of Action
Botox for injection is a sterile, vacuum-dried purified botulinum toxin type A, produced from fermentation of Hall strain Clostridium botulinum type A. Botox blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to acceptor sites on motor or sympathetic nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. This inhibition occurs as the neurotoxin cleaves SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within nerve endings. When injected intramuscularly at therapeutic doses, Botox produces partial chemical denervation of the muscle resulting in a localized reduction in muscle activity. In addition, the muscle may atrophy, axonal sprouting may occur, and extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors may develop.

Pediatric Health,Brineura (cerliponase alfa),"General Information
Brineura (cerliponase alfa) is a hydrolytic lysosomal N-terminal tripeptidyl peptidase.
Brineura is specifically indicated to slow the loss of ambulation in symptomatic pediatric patients 3 years of age and older with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), also known as tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) deficiency.
Brineura is supplied as an injection for intraventricular administration. Pre-treatment of patients with antihistamines with or without antipyretics or corticosteroids is recommended 30 to 60 minutes prior to the start of infusion.The recommended dosage is 300 mg administered once every other week as an intraventricular infusion followed by infusion of Intraventricular Electrolytes over approximately 4.5 hours. For complete information on preparation, specific intraventricular access device for use, and administration, see the full prescribing information.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Brineura was based on a non-randomized single-arm dose escalation clinical study with extension in symptomatic pediatric patients with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease, confirmed by TPP1 deficiency. Brineura-treated patients were compared to untreated patients from a natural history cohort. The Motor domain of a CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale was used to assess disease progression. Scores ranged from 3 (grossly normal) to 0 (profoundly impaired) with unit decrements representing milestone events in the loss of motor function (ability to walk or crawl). Twenty-four patients, aged 3 to 8 years were enrolled in the Brineura single-arm clinical study. One patient withdrew after week 1 due to inability to continue with study procedures; 23 patients were treated with Brineura 300 mg every other week for 48 weeks, and continued treatment during the extension period. In the clinical study with extension, patients were assessed for decline in the Motor domain of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale at 48, 72 and 96 weeks. Decline was defined as having an unreversed (sustained) 2category decline or an unreversed score of 0 in the Motor domain of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale. Patientsâ€™ responses to Brineura treatment were evaluated if at screening a combined Motor plus Language CLN2 score of less than 6 was recorded. Two patients with a combined Motor plus Language CLN2 score of 6 were excluded from the analyses; they maintained that score throughout the study period. Motor scores of the 22 Brineura-treated patients in the clinical study with extension were compared to scores of the independent natural history cohort that included 42 untreated patients who satisfied inclusion criteria for the clinical study. The results of logistic modeling with covariates (screening age, screening motor score, genotype: 0 key mutations (yes/no)), demonstrated the odds of Brineura-treated patients not having a decline by 96 weeks were 13 times the odds of natural history cohort patients not having a decline (Odds Ratio (95% CI): 13.1 (1.2, 146.9)). Descriptive non-randomized comparison In an unadjusted non-randomized comparison, of the 22 patients treated with Brineura and evaluated for efficacy at week 96, 21 (95%) did not decline, and only the patient who terminated early was deemed to have a decline in the Motor domain of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale. Results from the natural history cohort demonstrated progressive decline in motor function; of the 42 patients in the natural history cohort 21 (50%) experienced an unreversed (sustained) 2-category decline or unreversed score of 0 in the Motor domain of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale over 96 weeks. To further assess efficacy, the 22 patients from the Brineura clinical study with a baseline combined Motor plus Language CLN2 score less than 6 were matched to 42 patients in the natural history cohort. Patients were matched based on the following covariates: baseline age at time of screening within 3 months, genotype (0, 1, or 2 key mutations), and baseline Motor domain CLN2 score at time of screening. Using the Motor domain of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale, decline was defined as having an unreversed 2-category decline or an unreversed score of 0. At 96 weeks, the matched analysis based on 17 pairs demonstrated fewer declines in the Motor domain for Brineura-treated patients compared to untreated patients in the natural history cohort.

Brineura (cerliponase alfa) is a hydrolytic lysosomal N-terminal tripeptidyl peptidase. CLN2 disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (TPP1), which catabolizes polypeptides in the CNS. TPP1 has no known substrate specificity. Deficiency in TPP1 activity results in the accumulation of lysosomal storage materials normally metabolized by this enzyme in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to progressive decline in motor function. Cerliponase alfa (rhTTP1), a proenzyme, is taken up by target cells in the CNS and is translocated to the lysosomes through the Cation Independent Mannose-6-Phosphate Receptor (CI-MPR, also known as M6P/IGF2 receptor). Cerliponase alfa is activated in the lysosome and the activated proteolytic form of rhTPP1 cleaves tripeptides from the N-terminus of proteins.

Pediatric Health,Cuvposa (glycopyrrolate),"General Information
Cuvposa (glycopyrrolate) is a competitive inhibitor of acetylcholine receptors that are located on certain peripheral tissues, including salivary glands. Glycopyrrolate indirectly reduces the rate of salivation by preventing the stimulation of these receptors.
Cuvposa is specifically indicated to reduce chronic severe drooling in patients aged 3 to 16 years with neurologic conditions associated with problem drooling.
Cuvposa is supplied as a liquid solution for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is 0.02 mg/kg orally three times daily. The dosing may be titrated in increments of 0.02 mg/kg every 5-7 days based on therapeutic response and adverse reactions. The maximum recommended dosage is 0.1 mg/kg three times daily not to exceed 1.5-3 mg per dose based upon weight.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Cuvposa was based on a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, eight-week study in 38 subjects aged 3-23 years. Of these 38 subjects, 36 were ages were ages 2 - 16 years and two subjects were older than 16 years. All subjects had a diagnosis of cerebral palsy, mental retardation, or another neurologic condition associated with problem drooling, defined as drooling in the absence of treatment so that clothing became damp on most days (approximately five to seven days per week). The subjects received receive Cuvposa or placebo. Doses of Cuvposa were titrated over a 4-week period to optimal response beginning at 0.02 mg/kg given three times a day increasing doses in increments of approximately 0.02 mg/kg three times per day every 5-7 days, not to exceed the lesser of approximately 0.1 mg/kg three times per day or 3 mg three times per day. Efficacy was evaluated on the 9-point modified Teacher's Drooling Scale (mTDS). Scores were recorded by parents/caregivers three times daily approximately two hours post-dose on beginning at pre-treatment baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8 of therapy. A score of 1 meant Dry: never drools and a score of 9 meant Profuse: clothing, hands, tray and objects become wet; frequently. Responders were defined as subjects with at least a 3-point reduction in mean daily mTDS scores from baseline to Week 8. In the Cuvposa treatment arm, 75% of the patients were responders versus 11% in the placebo arm.

Pediatric Health,Emflaza (deflazacort),"General Information
Emflaza (deflazacort) is a corticosteroid which exerts anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects.
Emflaza is specifically indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients two (2) years of age and older.
Emflaza is supplied as a tablet or oral suspension. The recommended dose is approximately 0.9 mg/kg/day once daily. If tablets are used, round up to the nearest possible dose. Any combination of the four Emflaza tablet strengths (6 mg, 18 mg, 30 mg, and 36 mg) can be used to achieve this dose. If the oral suspension is used, round up to the nearest tenth of a milliliter (mL). Both the tablets and oral suspension can be taken with or without food
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Emflaza was based on a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week study conducted in the United States and Canada. The study population consisted of 196 male pediatric patients 5 to 15 years of age who were ambulatory and non-ambulatory. The patients were randomized to therapy with deflazacort (0.9 or 1.2 mg/kg/day), an active comparator or placebo. After 12 weeks, placebo patients were re-randomized to receive either deflazacort or the active comparator for an additional 40 weeks. A comparison to placebo was made after 12 weeks of treatment. Efficacy was evaluated by assessing the change between Baseline and Week 12 in average strength of 18 muscle groups. The change in average muscle strength score between Baseline and Week 12 was significantly greater for the deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day dose group, the recommended dose, than for the placebo group (p=0.017). Increases in muscle strength continued through the 52 week duration of the study demonstrating persistence of the treatment effect observed at Week 12. Results on several timed measures of patient function (i.e., time to stand from supine, time to climb four stairs and time to walk or run 30 feet) also numerically favored deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day at Week 12, in comparison with placebo.

Pediatric Health,Gattex (teduglutide),"General Information
Gattex (teduglutide) is an analog of naturally occurring human glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), a peptide secreted primarily in the distal intestine and involved in the regeneration and repair of the intestinal epithelium. GLP-2 is known to increase intestinal and portal blood flow, and inhibit gastric acid secretion.
Gattex is specifically indicated for the treatment of adults with Short Bowel Syndrome who are dependent on parenteral support. Gattex was subsequently approved for pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) who need additional nutrition or fluids from intravenous (IV) feeding (parenteral support).
Gattex is supplied as a powder for reconstitution into a solution designed for subcutaneous injection. The recommended daily dose is 0.05 mg/kg body weight administered by subcutaneous injection once daily. Alternation of sites for subcutaneous injection is recommended.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Gattex was based on four studies: Study 1 (Placebo-controlled) and Study 2 (Open-label extension of Study 1) and Study 3 (Placebo-controlled) and Study 4 (Blinded uncontrolled extension of Study 3).
Study 1 and Study 2
Study 1
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-national, multi-center clinical trial enrolled adults with SBS who were dependent on parenteral nutrition/intravenous (PN/I.V.) support for at least 12 months and required PN at least 3 times per week. For 8 weeks (or less) prior to randomization, investigators optimized the PN/I.V. volume of all subjects. Optimization was followed by a 4-week to 8-week period of fluid stabilization. Subjects then were randomized to placebo (n=43) or Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day (n=43). Study treatment was administered subcutaneously once daily for 24 weeks. PN/I.V. volume adjustments (up to 30% decrease) and clinical assessments were made at 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, and 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was based on a clinical response, defined as a subject achieving at least 20% reduction in weekly PN/I.V. volume from baseline to both Weeks 20 and 24. Treatment response was reached by 63% of Gattex-treated subjects versus 30% of placebo-treated subjects (p=0.002). At Week 24, the mean reduction in weekly PN/I.V. volume was 4.4 Liters for Gattex-treated subjects (from pre-treatment baseline of 12.9 Liters) versus 2.3 Liters for placebo-treated subjects (from pre-treatment baseline of 13.2 Liters/week) (p<0.001). Twenty-one subjects on Gattex (53.8%) versus 9 on placebo (23.1%) achieved at least a one-day reduction in PN/I.V. support.
Study 2
This ongoing two-year open-label extension of Study 1 has treated 88 subjects who receive Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day. Of responders in Study 1 who entered Study 2, 100% sustained their response to Gattex after one year of continuous treatment. A 20% or greater reduction of parenteral support was achieved in 72% of subjects after an additional 28 weeks of continuous Gattex treatment. The mean reduction of weekly PN/I.V. volume was 5.2 L/week after one year of continuous Gattex treatment. Six subjects in Study 2 were weaned off their PN/I.V. support while on Gattex.
Study 3 and 4
Study 3
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three parallel-group, multinational study enrolled adults with Short Bowel Syndrome who were dependent on parenteral nutrition/intravenous (PN/I.V.) support for at least 12 months and required PN at least 3 times per week. After a period of optimization and stabilization similar to Study 1, subjects were randomized to receive 24 weeks of one of the following treatment regimens: Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day (n=35), Gattex 0.10 mg/kg/day dose (n=33), or placebo (n=16). The primary efficacy endpoint was a graded categorical score that did not achieve statistical significance for the high dose. Evaluation of PN/I.V. volume reduction using the endpoint of response (defined as at least 20% reduction in PN/I.V. fluid from Baseline to Weeks 20 and 24) showed that 46% of subjects on Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day responded versus 6% on placebo. Subjects on Gattex at both dose levels experienced a 2.5 L/week reduction in parenteral support requirements versus 0.9 L/week for placebo at 24 weeks. Two subjects in the Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group were weaned off parenteral support by Week 24.
Study 4
This blinded, uncontrolled extension of Study 3, enrolled 65 subjects from Study 3 who received Gattex for up to an additional 28 weeks of treatment. Of responders in Study 3 who entered Study 4, 75% sustained response on Gattex after one year of treatment. In the Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day dose group, a 20% or greater reduction of parenteral support was achieved in 68% (17/25) of subjects. The mean reduction of weekly PN/I.V. volume was 4.9 L/week (52% reduction from baseline) after one year of continuous Gattex treatment. The subjects who had been completely weaned off PN/I.V. support in Study 3 remained off parenteral support through Study 4. During Study 4, an additional subject from Study 3 was weaned off parenteral support.
FDA Approval in Pediatrics:
In a 24-week pediatric study 59 pediatric patients with SBS aged 1 year through 17 years chose whether to receive Gattex or standard of care (SOC). Patients who chose to receive Gattex treatment were subsequently randomized in a double-blind manner to 0.025 mg/kg/day (n=24) or 0.05 mg/kg/day (n=26), while 9 patients enrolled in the SOC arm. The recommended dosage of Gattex is 0.05 mg/kg/day. Randomization to the Gattex dose groups was stratified by age. At the end of the 24-week study, 69% of patients (18/26) who took Gattex 0.05 mg/kg each day reduced PS volume by 20% or more. Based on patient-diary data, patients who received Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day experienced a 42% mean reduction in PS volume (mL/kg/day) from baseline (-23 mL/kg/day from baseline). At week 24, 38% of patients (10/26) were able to reduce PS infusion by at least 1 day per week. Patients reduced their PS infusion time by 3 hours per day on average compared to baseline. In addition, during this study 3 out of 26 (12%) children who received Gattex 0.05 mg/kg/day completely weaned off PS.

Pediatric Health,Hemlibra (emicizumab-kxwh),"General Information
Hemlibra (emicizumab-kxwh) is a bispecific factor IXa- and factor X-directed antibody.
Hemlibra is specifically indicated for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adult and pediatric patients ages newborn and older with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) with or without factor VIII inhibitors.
Hemlibra is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous injection. The recommended loading dose is 3 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection once weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of:
â€¢ 1.5 mg/kg once every week, or
â€¢ 3 mg/kg once every two weeks, or
â€¢ 6 mg/kg once every four weeks
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The initial FDA approval of Hemlibra was based on data from two clinical trials. The first was a trial that included 109 males aged 12 and older with hemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors. The randomized portion of the trial compared Hemlibra to no prophylactic treatment in 53 patients who were previously treated with on-demand therapy with a bypassing agent before enrolling in the trial. Patients taking Hemlibra experienced approximately 2.9 treated bleeding episodes per year compared to approximately 23.3 treated bleeding episodes per year for patients who did not receive prophylactic treatment. This represents an 87 percent reduction in the rate of treated bleeds. The trial also included patient-reported Quality of Life metrics on physical health. Patients treated with Hemlibra reported an improvement in hemophilia-related symptoms (painful swellings and joint pain) and physical functioning (pain with movement and difficulty walking) compared to patients who did not receive prophylactic treatment. The second trial was a single arm trial of 23 males under the age of 12 with hemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors. During the trial, 87 percent of the patients taking Hemlibra did not experience a bleeding episode that required treatment.
The expanded FDA approval- to include patients of all ages with or without factor VIII inhibitors- was based on two clinical trials: HAVEN 3 and HAVEN 4.
In HAVEN 3, a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial, 89 patients with severe hemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors who previously received episodic (on demand) treatment with FVIII were randomized (2:2:1) to receive Hemlibra prophylaxis 1.5 mg/kg once every week (Arm A), 3 mg/kg once every two weeks (Arm B), or no prophylaxis (Arm C). Patients were stratified by 24-week bleed rate prior to trial entry (< 9 or â‰¥ 9 bleeds). Patients received Hemlibra prophylaxis for a minimum of 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the annualized bleed rate (ABR) for treated bleeds. Hemlibra prophylaxis in Arm A resulted in a 96% reduction in ABR compared with Arm C. Hemlibra prophylaxis in Arm B also led to a 97% reduction in ABR compared with Arm C. HAVEN 3 also met all bleed-related secondary endpoints (all bleeds, treated spontaneous bleeds, treated joint bleeds and treated target joint bleeds).
HAVEN 4 was a single-arm, multicenter, open-label trial in 48 adult and adolescent males with hemophilia A with or without FVIII inhibitors who previously received either episodic (on demand) or prophylactic treatment with FVIII or bypassing agents. Patients in the expansion cohort (n=41) received Hemlibra prophylaxis 6 mg/kg once every four weeks for at least 24 weeks. The ABR for treated bleeds was 2.4 and the median ABR was 0.0.

Pediatric Health,"Kineret, anakinra","General Information
Kineret (anakinra) is an intravenous recombinant, nonglycosylated form of human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). It blocks the biologic activity of IL-1 alpha and beta by competitively inhibiting IL-1 binding to the interleukin-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI), which is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and organs. IL-1 production is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli and mediates various physiologic responses including inflammatory and immunological responses.
Kineret is specifically indicated for Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease, a severe form of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes.
Kineret is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous injection. The recommended starting dose is 1-2 mg/kg. The dose can be individually adjusted to a maximum of 8 mg/kg daily to control active inflammation.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Kineret was based on a long-term, open-label and uncontrolled study. This study included 43 NOMID patients 0.7 to 46 years of age who were given an initial Kineret dose of 1 to 2.4 mg/kg body weight. During the study, the dose was adjusted by 0.5 to 1 mg/kg increments to a protocol-specified maximum of 10 mg/kg daily, titrated to control signs and symptoms of disease. The maximum dose studied was 7.6 mg/kg/day. The average maintenance dose was 3 to 4 mg/kg daily. In general, the dose was given once daily, but for some subjects, the dose was split into twice daily administrations for better control of disease activity. The subjects were treated for up to 60 months. NOMID symptoms were assessed with a disease-specific Diary Symptom Sum Score (DSSS), which included the prominent disease symptoms fever, rash, joint pain, vomiting, and headache. Improvements occurred in all individual disease symptoms comprising the DSSS, as well as in the serum markers of inflammation. Results were consistent across all subgroups, including age, gender, presence of CIAS1 mutation, and disease phenotype. For 11 patients who went through a withdrawal phase, disease symptoms and serum markers of inflammation worsened after withdrawal and promptly responded to reinstitution of Kineret therapy. Upon withdrawal of treatment, the median time until disease flare criteria were met was 5 days.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Kineret for NOMID may include, but are not limited to, the following:
injection site reaction
headache

Pediatric Health,Kovaltry [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)],"General Information
Kovaltry is a recombinant, human DNA sequence derived, full length Factor VIII concentrate. It temporarily replaces the missing clotting Factor VIII that is needed for effective hemostasis.
Kovaltry is specifically indicated for use in adults and children with hemophilia A (congenital Factor VIII deficiency) for on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes, for the perioperative management of bleeding and for routine prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes.
Kovaltry is supplied as a powder for solution for intravenous use after reconstitution only. The recommended dose is as follows:
Control of bleeding episodes and perioperative management:
Required dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired Factor VIII rise (% of normal or IU/dL) x reciprocal of expected/observed recovery (e.g., 0.5 for a recovery of 2 IU/dL per IU/kg).
Estimated Increment of Factor VIII (IU/dL or % of normal) = [Total Dose (IU)/body weight (kg)] x 2 (IU/dL per IU/kg).
Routine prophylaxis:
Adults and adolescents: 20-40 IU/kg 2 or 3 times per week
Children â‰¤12 years old: 25-50 IU/kg 2 times per week, 3 times per week or every other day
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Kovaltry was based on the LEOPOLD trials:
LEOPOLD 1 was a multi-center, open-label, cross-over, uncontrolled study in adolescent and adult (age >12 years to <65 years) previously treated patients (PTPs) evaluating the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of routine prophylaxis, and perioperative management of bleeding with Kovaltry. The annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was the primary efficacy variable.
LEOPOLD 2 was a multi-center, open-label, cross-over, uncontrolled, randomized study in adolescent and adult (age 12 years to <65 years) PTPs evaluating the superiority of prophylaxis over on-demand treatment with Kovaltry over a one-year treatment period. ABR was the primary efficacy variable.
LEOPOLD Kids Part A was a multi-center, open-label, uncontrolled study in pediatric (<12 years of age) PTPs evaluating the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of routine prophylaxis, and perioperative management of bleeding with Kovaltry. The primary efficacy variable was annualized number of total bleeds during routine prophylaxis that occurred within 48 hours of previous prophylaxis infusion.
RESULTS:
The hemostatic efficacy in on-demand treatment of bleeds was assessed as either â€œgoodâ€� or â€œexcellentâ€� in 90.1% of cases (97.8% in the younger age group and 81.0% in the older age group). Majority of bleeds (89.7%) were successfully treated with â‰¤2 infusions. Response to treatment was similar for children aged 0 to <6 compared to 6 to 12 years of age.
The blood loss, during and after surgery, was within expected ranges. Hemostatic control was assessed by surgeons as â€œgoodâ€� (perioperative bleeding slightly but not clinically significantly increased over expectations for the non-hemophilic patient; treatment similar to non-hemophilic patient) or â€œexcellentâ€� (perioperative blood loss similar to the nonhemophilic patient).
Adults and Adolescents: The mean and median ABR for the ITT population in Study 1 was 3.8 Â± 5.2 and 1 bleed/year, respectively. In Study 2, comparison of the bleeding rates between subjects receiving on-demand therapy versus prophylaxis in an ANOVA demonstrated a statistically significant difference (p<0.0001) in the median ABR in subjects receiving on-demand therapy (60 bleeds per year) as compared to subjects receiving prophylaxis (2 bleeds per year). In Study 2, mean ABR in subjects receiving on-demand therapy was 57.7 Â± 24.6 versus 4.9 Â± 6.8 in the subjects receiving prophylaxis. Children 12 years of age and younger: In children 12 years of age and younger (n=51), the median ABR within 48 hours after prophylactic infusion was 0 for all bleeds, and 0 for spontaneous and joint bleeds. The median ABR during prophylactic treatment independent of time of infusion was 1.9 for all bleeds, 0 for spontaneous bleeds and 0 for joint bleeds. The mean ABR within 48 hours after prophylactic infusion was 2.04 Â± 2.91. The mean ABR at any time during the prophylaxis regimen was 3.75 Â± 4.98. In both age groups (0 to <6 years and 6 to 12 years), the ABR for spontaneous bleeds and joint bleeds within 48 hours after prophylactic treatment was 0. The median annualized number of spontaneous bleeds during prophylactic treatment independent of time of infusion was 0. The median annualized number of joint bleeds during prophylactic treatment independent of time of infusion was 0 in 0 to <6 years age group and 0 in 6 to 12 years age group. The majority (32/53) of bleeds that occurred within 48 hours after a previous prophylaxis infusion were trauma related. Twenty-three (45.1%) subjects reported no bleeds during the six-month prophylaxis period.

Mipomersen is an antisense oligonucleotide targeted to human messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for apo B-100, the principal apolipoprotein of LDL and its metabolic precursor, VLDL. Mipomersen is complementary to the coding region of the mRNA for apo B-100, and binds by Watson and Crick base pairing. The hybridization of mipomersen to the cognate mRNA results in RNase H-mediated degradation of the cognate mRNA thus inhibiting translation of the apo B-100 protein.

Pediatric Health,Nucala (mepolizumab),"General Information
Nucala (mepolizumab) is an interleukin-5 antagonist monoclonal antibody (IgG1 kappa).
Nucala is specifically indicated for the add-on maintenance treatment of patients with severe asthma aged 12 years and older, and with an eosinophilic phenotype. Nucala was subsequently approved in September of 2019 for use in children ages 6 to 11 years.
Nucala is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous administration. The recommended dose is 100 mg administered once every 4 weeks by subcutaneous injection into the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Nucala was based on three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials: 1 dose-ranging and exacerbation trial (Trial 1) and 2 confirmatory trials (Trials 2 and 3).
Trial 1:
Trial 1 was a 52-week dose-ranging and exacerbation-reduction trial in subjects with asthma with a history of 2 or more exacerbations in the previous year despite regular use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller(s) with or without oral corticosteroids. Subjects enrolled in this trial were required to have at least 1 of the following 4 pre-specified criteria in the previous 12 months: blood eosinophil count greater than or equal to 300 cells/mcL, sputum eosinophil count greater than or equal to 3%, exhaled nitric oxide concentration greater than or equal to 50 ppb, or deterioration of asthma control after less than or equal to 25% reduction in regular maintenance inhaled corticosteroids/oral corticosteroids. Three IV doses of mepolizumab (75, 250, and 750 mg) administered once every 4 weeks were evaluated compared with placebo. Results from this trial and the pharmacodynamic study supported the evaluation of mepolizumab 75 mg IV and 100 mg SC in the subsequent trials.
Trials 2 and 3:
A total of 711 subjects with asthma were studied in the 2 confirmatory trials (Trials 2 and 3). In these 2 trials subjects were required to have blood eosinophils of greater than or equal to 150 cells/mcL at screening (within 6 weeks of dosing) or blood eosinophils of greater than or equal to 300 cells/mcL within 12 months of enrollment. The screening blood eosinophils of greater than or equal to 150 cells/mcL criterion was derived from exploratory analyses of data from Trial 1. Trial 2 was a 32-week placebo- and active-controlled trial in subjects with asthma with a history of 2 or more exacerbations in the previous year despite regular use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller(s) with or without oral corticosteroids. Subjects received mepolizumab 75 mg IV (n = 191), Nucala (n = 194), or placebo (n = 191) once every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. Trial 3 was a 24-week oral corticosteroid-reduction trial in subjects with asthma who required daily oral corticosteroids in addition to regular use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller(s) to maintain asthma control. Subjects in Trial 3 were not required to have a history of exacerbations in the prior year. Subjects received Nucala (n = 69) or placebo (n = 66) once every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. The baseline mean oral corticosteroid use was similar in the 2 treatment groups: 13.2 mg in the placebo group and 12.4 mg in the group receiving Nucala.
Results:
The primary endpoint for Trials 1 and 2 was the frequency of exacerbations defined as worsening of asthma requiring use of oral/systemic corticosteroids and/or hospitalization and/or emergency department visits. For subjects on maintenance oral corticosteroids, an exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids was defined as the use of oral/systemic corticosteroids at least double the existing dose for at least 3 days. Compared with placebo, subjects receiving Nucala or mepolizumab 75 mg IV experienced significantly fewer exacerbations. Additionally, compared with placebo, there were fewer exacerbations requiring hospitalization and/or emergency department visits and exacerbations requiring only in-patient hospitalization with Nucala. Trial 3 evaluated the effect of NUCALA on reducing the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was the percent reduction of oral corticosteroid dose during Weeks 20 to 24 compared with baseline dose, while maintaining asthma control. Compared with placebo, subjects receiving Nucala achieved greater reductions in daily maintenance oral corticosteroid dose, while maintaining asthma control. Sixteen (23%) subjects in the group receiving Nucala versus 7 (11%) in the placebo group had a 90% to 100% reduction in their oral corticosteroid dose. Twenty-five (36%) subjects in the group receiving Nucala versus 37 (56%) in the placebo group were classified as having no improvement for oral corticosteroid dose. Additionally, 54% of subjects treated with Nucala achieved at least a 50% reduction in the daily prednisone dose compared with 33% of subjects treated with placebo.
The FDA approval of Nucala for use in children 6 to 11 years of age was based on an open-label study, conducted in children aged six to 11 years with severe eosinophilic asthma. The study investigated Nucalaâ€™s pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and long-term safety. Evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and adolescents also supported approval in this age group. The 52-week long-term phase of the study showed that the safety profile in paediatric patients aged six to 11 years was similar to the known safety profile in patients aged 12 years and older.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Nucala may include, but are not limited to, the following;

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Nucala or severe asthma please visit http://www.nucala.com/","Mechanism of Action
Nucala (mepolizumab) is an interleukin-5 antagonist monoclonal antibody (IgG1 kappa). IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth and differentiation, recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils. Mepolizumab binds to IL-5 with a dissociation constant of 100 pM, inhibiting the bioactivity of IL-5 by blocking its binding to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Multiple cell types and mediators are involved in inflammation. Mepolizumab, by inhibiting IL-5 signaling, reduces the production and survival of eosinophils; however, the mechanism of mepolizumab action in asthma has not been definitively established.

Pediatric Health,Orkambi (lumacaftor and ivacaftor),"General Information
Orkambi is a combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, both of which are oral cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. Lumacaftor is a CFTR corrector and aims to increase CFTR function by increasing the trafficking, or movement, of CFTR to the cell surface. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator and aims to increase the function of defective CFTR proteins by increasing the gating activity, or ability to transport ions across the cell membrane, of CFTR at the cell surface.
Orkambi is specifically indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients age 2 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. If the patientâ€™s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to detect the presence of the F508del mutation on both alleles of the CFTR gene.
Orkambi is supplied as a tablet (lumacaftor 200 mg and ivacaftor 125 mg) for oral administration. The recommended dose is as follows:
â€¢ Pediatric patients age 2 through 5 years and weighing less than 14 kg: one packet of granules (each containing lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg) mixed with 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of soft food or liquid and administered orally every 12 hours with fat-containing food.
â€¢ Pediatric patients age 2 through 5 years and weighing 14 kg or greater: one packet of granules (each containing lumacaftor 150 mg/ivacaftor 188 mg) mixed with 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of soft food or liquid and administered orally every 12 hours with fat-containing food.
â€¢ Pediatric patients age 6 through 11 years: two tablets (each containing lumacaftor 100 mg/ivacaftor 125 mg) taken orally every 12 hours with fat-containing food.
â€¢ Adults and pediatric patients age 12 years and older: two tablets taken orally every 12 hours. Reduce the dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. When initiating Orkambi in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, the reduce Orkambi dose for the first week of treatment.
For specific dose reductions please see the drug label.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Orkambi was based on a dose ranging trial and two confirmatory trials.
Dose Ranging:
One double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-cohort trial enrolled 97 Caucasian patients with CF (homozygous for the F508del mutation) 18 years of age and older with a screening ppFEV1 â‰¥40. In the trial, 76 patients (homozygous for the F508del mutation) were randomized to receive lumacaftor alone at once-daily doses of 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg or 400 mg q12h for 28 days followed by the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h and 27 patients (homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del mutation) received placebo. During the initial 28-day lumacaftor monotherapy period, treatment with lumacaftor demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in ppFEV1 compared to placebo. Changes from Day 1 at Day 28 in ppFEV1 compared to placebo were 0.24, -1.4, -2.7, and -4.6 for the 200 mg once daily, 400 mg once daily, 600 mg once daily, and 400 mg q12h lumacaftor doses, respectively. Following the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h, the changes from Day 1 at Day 56 in ppFEV1 compared to placebo were 3.8, 2.7, 5.6, and 4.2, respectively. Sweat chloride was also assessed in this trial. Following the initial 28 days of lumacaftor monotherapy, the changes from Day 1 at Day 28 in sweat chloride compared to placebo were -4.9, -8.3, -6.1, and -8.2 mmol/L for the 200 mg once daily, 400 mg once daily, 600 mg once daily, and 400 mg q12h lumacaftor doses, respectively. Following the addition of ivacaftor 250 mg q12h, the changes from Day 1 at Day 56 in sweat chloride compared to placebo were -5.0, -9.8, -9.5, and -11 mmol/L, respectively. These data supported the evaluation of lumacaftor 400 mg/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h (Orkambi formulation) and lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h in the confirmatory trials.
Confirmatory Trials:
The efficacy of Orkambi in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week clinical trials (Trials 1 and 2) in 1,108 clinically stable patients with CF of whom 369 patients received Orkambi twice daily. Trial 1 evaluated 549 patients with CF who were aged 12 years and older with ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90. Trial 2 evaluated 559 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 25.0 years) with ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90. Patients in both trials were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either Orkambi (lumacaftor 400 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h; or lumacaftor 600 mg once daily/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h) or placebo. Patients took the study drug with fat-containing food for 24 weeks in addition to their prescribed CF therapies. The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was change in lung function as determined by absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at Week 24, assessed as the average of the treatment effects at Week 16 and at Week 24. In both trials, treatment with Orkambi resulted in a statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1. The treatment difference between Orkambi and placebo for the mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at Week 24 (assessed as the average of the treatment effects at Week 16 and at Week 24) was 2.6 percentage points in Trial 1 (P=0.0003) and 3.0 percentage points in Trial 2 (P<0.0001). These changes persisted throughout the 24-week treatment period. Improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, disease severity, sex, and geographic region.
The FDA approval of Orkambi in children ages 2 through 5 years was based on a Phase III open-label safety study in 60 patients that showed treatment with Orkambi was generally safe and well tolerated for 24 weeks, with a safety profile similar to that in patients ages 6 years and older. Improvements in sweat chloride were observed at week 24 (mean decrease in sweat chloride from baseline of 31.7 mmol/L; n=49).

The F508del mutation results in protein misfolding, causing a defect in cellular processing and trafficking that targets the protein for degradation and therefore reduces the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. The small amount of F508del-CFTR that reaches the cell surface is less stable and has low channel-open probability (defective gating activity) compared to wild-type CFTR protein. Lumacaftor improves the conformational stability of F508del-CFTR, resulting in increased processing and trafficking of mature protein to the cell surface. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that facilitates increased chloride transport by potentiating the channel-open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. In vitro studies have demonstrated that both lumacaftor and ivacaftor act directly on the CFTR protein in primary human bronchial epithelial cultures and other cell lines harboring the F508del-CFTR mutation to increase the quantity, stability, and function of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increased chloride ion transport. In vitro responses do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic response or clinical benefit.

Before administering the dose, vigorously shake the bottle of Quillivant XR for at least 10 seconds, to ensure that the proper dose is administered.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Quillivant XR was based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, multicenter, laboratory classroom study of 45 pediatrics (ages 6 to 12 years) with ADHD. There was an open-label dose optimization period (four to six weeks) with an initial 20mg dose of Quillivant XR once daily in the morning. The dose was titrated weekly in 10 or 20mg increments until an optimal dose or maximum dose of 60mg per day was reached. Subjects then entered a two-week double-blind, crossover treatment of the individually optimized dose of Quillivant XR or placebo. At the end of each week, the attention and behavior of the patients in a laboratory classroom were evaluated using the SKAMP rating scale. Quillivant XR significantly improved ADHD symptoms compared to placebo at the primary endpoint of four hours post-dose, and in a secondary analysis, showed significant improvement at every time point measured, from 45 minutes to 12 hours after dosing.

Maximum single dose is 15 mg; maximum daily dose is 50 mg.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ruzurgi was based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal study of 32 adult patients in which patients were taking Ruzurgi for at least three months prior to entering the study. The study compared patients continuing on Ruzurgi to patients switched to placebo. The primary measure of efficacy was the categorization of the degree of change (e.g., greater than 30% deterioration) in the Triple Timed Up and Go test (3TUG) upon withdrawal of active medication, when compared with the time-matched average of the 3TUG assessments at baseline. The 3TUG is a measure of the time it takes a person to rise from a chair, walk 3 meters, and return to the chair for 3 consecutive laps without pause. Higher 3TUG scores represent greater impairment. None of the patients randomized to continue on Ruzurgi experienced a greater than 30% deterioration in the final post-dose 3TUG test. In contrast, 72% of the patients in the placebo group did experience a greater than 30% deterioration in the final post-dose 3TUG test.

The recommended dose of Soliris for pediatrics under the age of 18 years is based on body weight.
The recommended dose of Soliris for gMG and NMSOD consists of: â€¢ 900 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by â€¢ 1200 mg for the fifth dose 1 week later, then â€¢ 1200 mg every 2 weeks thereafter. Administer Soliris at the recommended dosage regimen time points, or within two days of these time points. is 900 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1200 mg for the fifth dose 1 week later, then 1200 mg every 2 weeks thereafter.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Soliris for PNH was based on the results of three clinical trials.
Study 1
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 87 subjects who had received at least four transfusions in the prior 12 months, had a flow cytometric confirmation of at least 10% PNH cells and platelet counts of at least 100,000/microliter. All subjects received meningococcal vaccination prior to treatment. They were subsequently observed to determine the hemoglobin concentration ""set-point"" in order to define each patientâ€™s hemoglobin stabilization and transfusion outcomes. The subjects were then randomized to receive placebo or Soliris, via intravenous infusion over 25 - 45 minutes, at 600 mg every 7 Â± 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 Â± 2 days later, then 900 mg every 14 Â± 2 days for 26 weeks. Primary endpoints included hemoglobin stabilization, the number of RBC units transfused, fatigue, and health-related quality of life. Results revealed that the subjects treated with Soliris had significantly reduced hemolysis compared to placebo (p< 0.001), resulting in improvements in anemia as indicated by increased hemoglobin stabilization and reduced need for RBC transfusions. After 3 weeks of Soliris treatment, patients reported less fatigue and improved health-related quality of life.
Study 2 and extension study
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 97 subjects, 96 of whom completed treatment, who had received at least one transfusion in the prior 24 months and with at least 30,000 platelets/microliter. All subjects received meningococcal vaccination prior to treatment followed by Soliris, via intravenous infusion over 25 - 45 minutes, at 600 mg every 7 Â± 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 Â± 2 days later, then 900 mg every 14 Â± 2 days for 52 weeks. Concomitant medications included anti-thrombotic agents and systemic corticosteroids. The primary endpoints were the same as in study 1. A reduction in intravascular hemolysis, measured by serum LDH levels, was sustained for the treatment period and resulted in a reduced need for RBC transfusion and less fatigue. The long term study enrolled 187 Soliris treated subjects. A reduction in intravascular hemolysis over a total Soliris exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 months was sustained by all the subjects. In addition, there were fewer thrombotic events with Soliris treatment than during the same period of time prior to treatment. The effects of concomitant anticoagulant therapy withdrawal during Soliris therapy was not studied.
The FDA approval of Soliris for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was based on three single-arm studies: two prospective (aHUS Studies 1 and 2) and one retrospective study (aHUS Study 3). In all studies, the dose of Soliris in adult and adolescent patients was 900 mg every 7 days for four weeks, followed by 1200 mg 7 days later, then 1200 mg every 14 days thereafter. The dosage regimen for pediatrics weighing less than 40 kg enrolled in aHUS Study 3 was based on body weight. Efficacy evaluations were based on thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) endpoints. These endpoints included platelet count change from baseline, hematologic normalization, complete TMA response, TMA-event free status and daily TMA intervention rate.
aHUS Resistant to PE/PI (aHUS Study 1)
This trial enrolled 17 subjects who displayed signs of TMA despite receiving at least four PE/PI treatments the week prior to screening. The subjects received Soliris for a minimum of 26 weeks. Soliris reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. The mean platelet count increased from 109 x10(9)/L at baseline to 169 x10(9)/L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count at week 26: 210 x10(9)/L). Renal function, as measured by median eGFR, was improved during Soliris therapy. Four of the five subjects who required dialysis at study entry were able to discontinue dialysis for the duration of Soliris treatment.
aHUS Sensitive to PE/PI (aHUS Study 2)
This trial enrolled 20 subjects undergoing chronic PE/PI who generally did not display hematologic signs of ongoing thrombotic microangiopathy. The subjects received Soliris for a minimum of 26 weeks. Soliris reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. Platelet counts were maintained at normal levels despite the elimination of PE/PI. The mean platelet count was 229 x 10(9)/L at baseline, and 233 x10(9)/L at week 26. Renal function, as measured by median eGFR, was maintained during Soliris therapy.
Retrospective Study in Patients with aHUS (aHUS Study 3)
This trial enrolled 19 pediatrics (ages 2 months to 17 years) who received Soliris for a median duration of 16 weeks. Soliris reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline. Mean platelet count increased from 171 x10(9)/L at baseline to 233 x10(9)/L after one week of therapy; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count at week 26: 254 x10(9)/L). Nine subjects experienced an eGFR improvement of at least 15 mL/min/1.73 m2.
The FDA approval of Soliris for gMG was based on a 26-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. A total of 62 patients were randomized to receive Soliris treatment and 63 were randomized to receive placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was a comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the Myasthenia Gravis-Specific Activities of Daily Living scale (MG-ADL) total score at Week 26. A statistically significant difference favoring Soliris was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in MG-ADL total scores [-4.2 points in the Soliris treated group compared with -2.3 points in the placebo-treated group (p=0.006)].
The FDA approval of Soliris for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive was based on a study of 143 patients who were randomized to receive either Soliris treatment or placebo. Compared to treatment with placebo, the study showed that treatment with Soliris reduced the number of NMOSD relapses by 94 percent over the 48-week course of the trial. Soliris also reduced the need for hospitalizations and the need for treatment of acute attacks with corticosteroids and plasma exchange.

Immunize patients with meningococcal vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of Soliris, unless the risks of delaying Soliris therapy outweigh the risk of developing a meningococcal infection. Monitor patients for early signs of meningococcal infections and evaluate immediately if infection is suspected. Soliris is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Soliris or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and generalized Myasthenia Gravis, please visit the Soliris web page.","Mechanism of Action
Soliris is a is a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG2/4 antibody produced by murine myeloma cell culture. A genetic mutation in PNH leads to the generation of abnormal red blood cells (RBCs) that are deficient in terminal complement inhibitors, rendering them sensitive to persistent terminal complement-mediated destruction. The destruction and loss of these RBCs leads to the symptoms associated with PNH. The active ingredient in Soliris, eculizumab, specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. Soliris inhibits terminal complement mediated intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients.

Pediatric Health,Surfaxin (lucinactant),"General Information
Surfaxin (lucinactant) is a synthetic formulation of pulmonary surfactant. Endogenous pulmonary surfactant lowers surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveolar surfaces during respiration and stabilizes the alveoli against collapse at resting transpulmonary pressures. A deficiency of pulmonary surfactant in premature infants results in respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Surfaxin compensates for the deficiency of surfactant and restores surface activity to the lungs of these infants.
Surfaxin is specifically indicated for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants at high risk for RDS.
Surfaxin is supplied as a solution for intratracheal administration. The recommended dose of Surfaxin is 5.8 mL per kg birth weight. Up to four doses of Surfaxin can be administered in the first 48 hours of life. Doses should be given no more frequently than every six hours.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Surfaxin was based on a single randomized, double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled, multi-dose study involving 1,294 premature infants in Europe and Latin America. The infants weighed between 600 g and 1,250 g at birth and were 32 weeks or less in gestational age. Within the first 30 minutes after birth, infants were randomized to receive one of three surfactants, Surfaxin (5.8 mL per kg), colfosceril palmitate (5.0 mL per kg) or beractant (4.0 mL per kg). Infants in the Surfaxin and beractant groups could be given up to three additional doses between six and 24 hours of birth, as often as every six hours, if they subsequently developed RDS and required mechanical ventilation. Infants in the colfosceril palmitate group could receive up to two additional doses at least 12 hours apart if they met the retreatment criteria. Some infants received placebo air to maintain blinding of the study. All doses were calculated based on birth weight. Infants were followed through 12-months corrected age. Co-primary endpoints were the incidence of RDS at 24 hours and RDS-related mortality at 14 days, with the intent of demonstrating superiority over colfosceril palmitate. Beractant served as an additional active comparator. Compared to colfosceril palmitate, Surfaxin demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in both RDS at 24 hours (39% versus 47%) and RDS-related mortality through Day 14 (5% versus 9%).
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Surfaxin may include, but are not limited to, the following:
endotracheal tube reflux

Pediatrics/Neonatology,Adderall (mixed salts of a single-entity amphetamine),"General Information
Adderall has been indicated for use in children three years of age and older with ADHD as an integral part of a total treatment program which typically includes psychological, educational, and social measures.
Adderall may improve attention span, decrease distractibility, and increase the ability to follow directions and finish tasks. The therapy may also improve the subject's ability to think before acting (decrease impulsivity), decrease hyperactivity and improve legibility of handwriting. In addition, aggression may decrease in youngsters with ADHD.
Adderall is available in 10 mg and 20 mg double-scored tablets.
","Side Effects
Adderall is generally well tolerated with few adverse reactions reported. The most frequently reported adverse reactions include anorexia, insomnia, stomach pain, headache, irritability, and weight loss. As with most psychostimulants indicated for ADHD, the possibility of growth suppression and the potential for precipitating motor tics and Tourette Syndrome exists with Adderall treatment, and in rare cases exacerbations of psychosis have been reported. Since psychostimulants have a high potential for abuse, Adderall should only be prescribed as part of an overall treatment program for ADHD with close physician supervision.
","Additional Information
Adderall had previously been approved and marketed by another company under the name of Obetrol, indicated for exogenous obesity and ADHD. Richwood acquired the company, including the formulation and manufacturing rights to Obetrol, and renamed the product Adderall in 1994.",
Pediatrics/Neonatology,Adderall XR,"General Information
Adderall XR, an extended release formulation of Shire's previously approved ADHD treatment Adderall, has been approved for treatment of ADHD in children. This once-daily capsule provides all day treatment with one morning dose, unlike most ADHD treatments that require a midday dose. This dosing regimen eliminates the social stigma issues felt by children having to bring medication to school and decreases the possibility of medication misuse.
ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder among school-aged children. Symptoms include inattentive, impulsive and hyperactive behavior that interferes with a child's ability to properly function in academic and social settings.
Clinical Results
Approval of Adderall XR is based on two clinical studies, involving more than 600 pediatric subjects at over 50 sites.

Pediatrics/Neonatology,Aldurazyme (laronidase),"General Information
Aldurazyme (laronidase) is a recombinant alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS-I).
Aldurazyme is indicated for patients aged 5 to 65 with Hurler and Hurler-Scheie forms of Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) and for patients with the Scheie form who have moderate to severe symptoms.
Aldurazyme is supplied as a sterile solution in clear Type I glass 5 mL vials (2.9 mg laronidase per 5 mL). The recommended dosage regimen of Aldurazyme is 0.58 mg/kg of body weight administered once weekly as an intravenous infusion.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Aldurazyme was based on a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 45 MPS I subjects. One subject was clinically assessed as having the Hurler form, 37 the Hurler-Scheie form and 7 the Scheie form. All subjects had a baseline forced vital capacity (FVC) less than or equal to 77% of predicted. Subjects received Aldurazyme (0.58 mg/kg) or placebo once weekly for 26 weeks and were treated with antipyretics and antihistamines before each infusion. The primary efficacy outcome assessments were FVC and distance walked in 6 minutes (6-minute walk test, 6MWT).
Results showed that after 26 weeks, subjects treated with Aldurazyme showed improvement in FVC and in 6MWT compared to placebo-treated subjects. Data demonstrated that liver size and urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels decreased in subjects treated with Aldurazyme compared with subjects treated with placebo. No subject in the group receiving Aldurazyme reached the normal range for urinary GAG levels during this 6-month study.
All 45 patients received open-label Aldurazyme for 36 weeks following the double-blind period. Maintenance of mean FVC and an additional increase in mean 6MWT distance were observed compared to the start of the open-label period among subjects who were initially randomized to and then continued to receive Aldurazyme. Among subjects who had been initially randomized to placebo, improvements from baseline in mean FVC and 6MWT distance were observed compared to the start of the open-label.
Approximately 91% of subjects treated with Aldurazyme were positive for antibodies to laronidase. The clinical significance of antibodies to Aldurazyme is not known, including the potential for product neutralization.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Fabrazyme may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Upper respiratory tract infection
Injection site reaction
Rash
Vein disorder
Hyperreflexia
Paresthesia
Edema
","Additional Information
For additional information on Mucopolysaccharidosis I or Aldurazyme, please visit The Aldurazyme Web Site","Mechanism of Action
Aldurazyme (laronidase), an enzyme replacement therapy is a polymorphic variant of the human enzyme, ?-L-iduronidase that is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. By replacing the missing enzyme, Aldurazyme helps the body break down the glycosaminoglycans (GAG) that builds up in cells and tissues. Regular replacement of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase with Aldurazyme helps prevent the buildup of GAG.
Aldurazyme was shown to significantly reduce the levels of GAG excreted in the urine, and decrease the size of livers enlarged by the disorder. This showed that the drug works effectively at a biochemical level.

Pediatrics/Neonatology,Alinia (nitazoxanide),"General Information
Alinia for Oral Suspension contains the active ingredient, nitazoxanide (2-acetyloxy-N- (5-nitro-2-thiazolyl) benzamide), a synthetic antiprotozoal agent for oral administration.
Alinia for Oral Suspension is indicated for the treatment of diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia parasites in pediatric patients 1 through 11 years of age.
Alinia for Oral Suspension (100 mg/5mL) will be available in a liquid suspension form. In addition, safety and effectiveness have not been established in patients with immune deficiencies such as patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Clinical Results
Giardia lamblia:
In a randomized, controlled study conducted in Peru in 110 pediatric patients with diarrhea caused by Giardia lamblia, a three-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide (100 mg BID in pediatric patients ages 24-47 months, 200 mg BID in pediatric patients ages 4 through 11 years) was compared to a five-day course of treatment with metronidazole (125 mg BID in pediatric patients ages 2 through 5 years, 250 mg BID in pediatric patients ages 6 through 11 years). Clinical response was evaluated 7 to 10 days following initiation of treatment with a â€˜wellâ€™ response defined as â€˜no symptoms, no watery stools and no more than 2 soft stools with no hematochezia within the past 24 hoursâ€™ or â€˜no symptoms and no unformed stools within the past 48 hours.â€™ The following clinical cure rates were obtained: Nitazoxanide (3 days) had a 90% (43/48) response rate and Metronidazole (5 days) had a 83% (39/47) response rate.
Cryptosporidium parvum:
In two double-blind, controlled studies in pediatric patients with diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum, a three-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide (100 mg BID in pediatric patients ages 12-47 months, 200 mg BID in pediatric patients ages 4 through 11 years) was compared with a placebo. One study was conducted in Egypt in outpatients ages 1 through 11 years with diarrhea caused by C. parvum. Another study was conducted in Zambia in malnourished pediatric patients admitted to the hospital with diarrhea caused by C. parvum. Clinical response was evaluated 3 to 7 days post-therapy with a â€˜wellâ€™ response defined as â€˜no symptoms, no watery stools and no more than 2 soft stools with no hematochezia within the past 24 hoursâ€™ or â€˜no symptoms and no unformed stools within the past 48 hours.â€™ The results show a clinical response rate for nitazoxanide of 88% (21/24) versus 38% (9/24) for placebo.

","Additional Information
For additional information on Alinia (nitazoxanide), please contact Romark Laboratories","Mechanism of Action
Following oral administration in humans, nitazoxanide is rapidly hydrolyzed to an active metabolite, tizoxanide (desacetyl-nitazoxanide). Tizoxanide then undergoes conjugation, primarily by glucuronidation.
The antiprotozoal activity of nitazoxanide is believed to be due to interference with the pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme-dependent electron transfer reaction, which is essential to anaerobic energy metabolism. Studies have shown that the PFOR enzyme from Giardia lamblia directly reduces nitazoxanide by transfer of electrons in the absence of ferredoxin. The DNAderived PFOR protein sequence of Cryptosporidium parvum appears to be similar to that of Giardia lamblia.

Pediatrics/Neonatology,"Alprolix [Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein]","General Information
Alprolix Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein, is a recombinant DNA derived, coagulation Factor IX concentrate. It temporarily replaces the missing coagulation Factor IX needed for effective hemostasis.
Alprolix is specifically indicated in adults and children with hemophilia B for control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative management and routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes.
Alprolix is supplied as a powder for reconstitution into a solution for intravenous injection. The recommended dosing is as follows:
Control and prevention of bleeding episodes and perioperative management:
Minor and Moderate bleeding: 30-60 Circulating FIX (IU/dL), repeat every 48 hours as needed
Major bleeding: 80-100 Circulating FIX (IU/dL), Consider repeat dose after 6-10 hours, then every 24 hours for 3 days, then every 48 hours until healing achieved
Routine prophylaxis:
50 IU/kg once weekly or 100 IU/kg once every 10 days. Adjust dosing regimen based on individual response.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Alprolix was based on a multi center open label trial that compared each of two prophylactic treatment regimens (fixed weekly and individualized interval) to episodic (on-demand) treatment; determined hemostatic efficacy in the treatment of bleeding episodes; and determined hemostatic efficacy during perioperative management of subjects undergoing major surgical procedures. A total of 123 previously treated patients (PTPs) with severe hemophilia B (= 2% endogenous FIX activity), ages 12-71, were followed for up to 77 weeks. Sixty three subjects in the fixed weekly interval arm received Alprolix for routine prophylaxis starting at an initial dose of 50 IU/kg. The dose was adjusted to maintain FIX trough level between 1% and 3% above baseline or higher, as clinically indicated to prevent bleeding. Twenty nine subjects in the individualized interval arm received Alprolix for routine prophylaxis at a dose of 100 IU/kg every 10 days, with the interval adjusted to maintain FIX trough level between 1% and 3% above baseline or higher, as clinically indicated to prevent bleeding. Twenty seven subjects received Alprolix as needed for the treatment of bleeding episodes in the episodic (on-demand) treatment arm. Twelve subjects received Alprolix for perioperative management in 14 major surgical procedures. The overall median annualized bleeding rates (including spontaneous and traumatic bleeds) were 2.95 in the weekly prophylaxis arm, 1.38 in the individualized interval prophylaxis arm, and 17.69 in the episodic treatment arm. In the individualized interval prophylaxis arm, the median dosing interval during the last 6 months on study was 14 days. Overall, 90.4% of bleeding episodes were controlled by a single injection of rFIXFc. Routine Prophylaxis: Using a negative binomial model, a reduction in annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of 83% (76-89%) for subjects in the fixed weekly interval arm and a reduction of 87% (80-92%) for subjects in the individualized interval arm compared to the episodic (on-demand) treatment arm was observed.

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Altabax was based on the results of a double-blind, randomized, multi-center, parallel group, comparison trial. This study enrolled 210 adult and pediatric subjects, aged 9 months of age and older, with impetigo up to 100 cm2 in total area (up to 10 lesions) or a total body surface area not exceeding 2%. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive Altabax or placebo for five days. Success was defined as the absence of treated lesions, or treated lesions had become dry without crusts with or without erythema compared to baseline, or had improved (defined as a decline in the size of the affected area, number of lesions or both) such that no further antimicrobial therapy was required. The intent-to-treat clinical (ITTC) population consisted of all randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of Altabax. The clinical per protocol (PPC) population included all ITTC patients who satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria and subsequently adhered to the protocol. The intent-to-treat bacteriological (ITTB) population consisted of all randomized patients who took at least one dose of study medication and had a pathogen identified at study entry. The bacteriological per protocol (PPB) population included all ITTB patients who satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria and subsequently adhered to the protocol. At the end of therapy, two days after treatment , the success rates in the Altabax group were as follows: PPC (89.5%), ITTC (85.6%), PPB (89.7%), ITTB (88.6%) versus 53.2%, 52.1%, 50.0% and 49.1%, respectively, for placebo. At the treatment follow-up (9 days after therapy) success rates were as follows: PPC (82.4%), ITTC (75.5%), PPB (84.3%) and ITTB (79.8%) versus 43.1%, 39.4%, 37.5% and 33.3%, respectively, for placebo. At the end of therapy, the success rates for the subjects infected with Staphylococcus aureus was 89.8% versus 52.1% for placebo.

Altabax is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor belonging to a class of compounds called pleuromutilins. These compounds act by inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis at the level of bacterial 50S ribosome. This binding site involves ribosomal protein L3 and is in the region of the ribosomal P site and peptidyl transferase center. By virtue of binding to this site, pleuromutilins inhibit peptidyl transfer, block P-site interactions, and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.

Alvesco is specifically indicated for the maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy in adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older.
Alvesco is supplied as a 80 mcg or 160 mcg dose designed for oral inhalation. The recommended initial dose of the drug is as follows:
Patients over 12 years who previously received bronchodilators alone:
Recommended starting dose: 80 mcg twice daily.
Highest recommended dose: 160 mcg twice daily.
Patients over 12 years who previously received inhaled corticosteroids:
Recommended starting dose: 80 mcg twice daily.
Highest recommended dose: 320 mcg twice daily.
Patients over 12 years who received oral corticosteroids:
Recommended starting dose: 320 mcg twice daily.
Highest recommended dose: 320 mcg twice daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Alvesco was based on the results of six randomized double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group clinical trials in adult and adolescent subjects 12 years of age and older with mild persistent to severe persistent asthma. The primary efficacy endpoint in four of the six trials was the mean change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 at endpoint (last observation). FEV1 was measured prior to the morning dose of study medication (at the end of the 24-hour dosing interval for once daily administration, and at the end of the 12-hour dosing interval for twice daily administration). In one of the six trials, the primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the average of the pre-dose FEV1 at Weeks 12 and 16, and in another trial, reduction of oral corticosteroid use was the primary efficacy endpoint. The results are as follows:
Patients Previously Maintained on Bronchodilators Alone
This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial enrolled 691 subjects with a mean baseline percent predicted FEV1 of 72%. The subjects Alvesco 160 mcg once daily in the morning for 16 weeks, Alvesco 80 mcg twice daily for 16 weeks, or Alvesco 80 mcg twice daily for 4 weeks followed by Alvesco 160 mcg once daily in the morning for 12 weeks or placebo for 16 weeks. All Alvesco doses showed statistically significant improvement over placebo at week 16 in AM pre-dose FEV1. However, the increase in the Alvesco 80 mcg twice daily arm was significantly greater than that observed in the Alvesco 160 mcg administered once daily arm. Compared to placebo, increases in AM pre-dose FEV1 were 0.12 L or 5.0 % for Alvesco 160 mcg once daily, 0.24 L or 10.4 % for Alvesco 80 mcg twice daily, 0.13 L or 5.0 % for Alvesco 80 mcg twice daily for 4 weeks followed by Alvesco 160 mcg once daily. Other measures of asthma control, AM PEF and need for rescue albuterol also improved in all the Alvesco treatment groups compared to placebo but the improvement was greatest with the Alvesco 80 mcg twice daily treatment arm.
Patients Previously Maintained on Inhaled Corticosteroids
Nycomed conducted two randomized-double blind placebo controlled trials each of 12-weeks treatment duration. In the first trial subjects with mean baseline percent predicted FEV1 of 79% received Alvesco 160 mcg once daily in the morning, ALVESCO 80 mcg twice daily or placebo. Statistically significantly more increases in AM pre-dose FEV1 compared to placebo were seen at 12 weeks for Alvesco 160 mcg once daily (0.14 L or 5.7%) and Alvesco 80 mcg twice daily (0.19 L or 7.5%). Asthma symptoms scores, AM PEF, and decreased need for rescue albuterol remained relatively stable in the Alvesco treatment groups compared to slight worsening in the placebo group.
In the second trial, 257 subjects with mean baseline percent predicted FEV1 of 54% were treated with Alvesco 160 or 320 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks. Compared to placebo, both Alvesco doses showed statistically significantly more improvement in pre-dose FEV1 (0.11 L or 8.6% and 0.18 L or 11.8%). Other measures of asthma control, AM PEF, symptoms, and need for rescue albuterol also showed improvement compared to placebo.
Patients Previously Maintained on Oral Corticosteroids:
This 12-week, double-blind clinical trial enrolled 140 subjects with mean FEV1 at baseline 53% predicted. The subjects were randomized to Alvesco given by inhalation aerosol at doses of 320 or 640 mcg twice daily or placebo. The average corticosteroid (prednisone) dose at baseline was approximately 12 mg/day. Compared to patients on placebo whose prednisone requirements increased by 4%, those treated with Alvesco 320 mcg and 640 mcg twice daily significantly reduced their prednisone requirements by 47% and 62% respectively. Those on Alvesco also maintained asthma control as reflected by lung function, symptoms, and need for rescue albuterol. A significantly larger percentage of patients on Alvesco were able to reduce oral prednisone use by 50% or more as compared to placebo (64% and 77% of the patients treated with 320 mcg and 640 mcg respectively twice daily as compared with 33% of patients on placebo).

"
Pediatrics/Neonatology,Aptivus (tipranavir),"General Information
Aptivus is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor that inhibits the virus-specific processing of the viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation of mature virions.
Aptivus is specifically indicated in combination with ritonavir for the treatment of HIV-1 infected patients, adult and pediatrics, who are treatment-experienced and infected with HIV-1 strains resistant to more than one protease inhibitor.
Aptivus is supplied as a capsule (250 mg) or oral soultion (100 mg/mL) formulation. Aptivus must be co-administered with ritonavir to exert its therapeutic effect. Failure to correctly co-administer Aptivus with ritonavir will result in plasma levels of tipranavir that will be insufficient to achieve the desired antiviral effect and will alter some drug interactions. The recommended initial dose of the drug is as follows:
Adults
Aptivus 500 mg (two 250 mg capsules or 5 mL oral solution) co-administered with 200 mg of ritonavir, twice daily.
Pediatrics (age 2 to 18 years)
Aptivus 14 mg/kg with 6 mg/kg ritonavir (or 375 mg/m2 co-administered with ritonavir 150 mg/m2) taken twice daily, not to exceed a maximum dose of Aptivus 500 mg co-administered with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily. For children who develop intolerance or toxicity and cannot continue with Aptivus 14 mg/kg with 6 mg/kg ritonavir, physicians may consider decreasing the dose to Aptivus 12 mg/kg with 5 mg/kg ritonavir (or Aptivus 290 mg/m2 co-administered with 115 mg/m2 ritonavir) taken twice daily, provided their virus is not resistant to multiple protease inhibitors.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Aptivus was based on the following results:
Adults
Two ongoing, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter studies, dubbed RECIST 1 and RECIST 2, enrolled 1,483 HIV-1 positive, triple antiretroviral class experienced subjects. The subjects received either Aptivus co-administered with 200 mg of ritonavir plus optimal backgroumd therapy (OBR) or a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) (lopinavir, amprenavir, saquinavir or indinavir) plus OBR. The studies evaluated treatment response at 48 weeks. Through 48 weeks of treatment, the proportion of subjects in the Aptivus/ritonavir arm compared to the comparator PI/ritonavir arm with HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL was 30.3% and 13.6% respectively, and with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL was 22.7% and 10.2% respectively. Among all randomized and treated subjects, the median change from baseline in HIV-1 RNA at the last measurement up to Week 48 was -0.64 log10 copies/mL in patients receiving APTIVUS/ritonavir versus -0.22 log10 copies/mL in the comparator PI/ritonavir arm. The median change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at the last measurement up to Week 48 was +23 cells/mm3 in patients receiving Aptivus/ritonavir versus +4 cells/mm3 in the comparator PI/ritonavir arm.
Pediatrics
This randomized, open-label, multicenter study enrolled 110 HIV-1 infected, treatment-experienced pediatric patients. The subjects were randomized to receive one of two Aptivus/ritonavir dose regimens: 375 mg/m2/150 mg/m2 dose or 290 mg/m2/115 mg/m2 dose, plus background therapy of at least two non-protease inhibitor antiretroviral drugs, optimized using baseline genotypic resistance testing. All patients initially received Aptivus oral solution. Of the 110 enrolled subjects, 83 (75%) completed the 48 week period. At 48 weeks, 40% of subjects had viral load <400 copies/mL. The proportion of subjects with viral load <400 copies/mL tended to be greater (70%) in the youngest group, who had less baseline viral resistance, compared to the older groups (37% and 31%). A greater proportion of subjects receiving Aptivus/ritonavir 375 mg/m2/150 mg/m2 compared to 290 mg/m2/115 mg/m2 achieved HIV-1 RNA < 400 and < 50 copies/mL. A greater proportion of subjects 6 to18 years of age with multiple baseline protease inhibitor resistance-associated substitutions receiving Aptivus/ritonavir 375 mg/m2/150 mg/m2 achieved HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL at 48 weeks compared to those receiving Aptivus/ritonavir 290 mg/m2/115 mg/m2. No clinically significant increase in adverse event rates observed with 375 mg/m2/150 mg/m2 compared to 290 mg/m2/115 mg/m2.

Tipranavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor that inhibits the virus-specific processing of the viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation of mature virions. Tipranavir demonstrates antiviral activity in cell culture against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M nonclade B isolates (A, C, D, F, G, H, CRF01 AE, CRF02 AG, CRF12 BF). Group O and HIV-2 isolates have reduced susceptibility in cell culture to tipranavir with EC50 values ranging from 0.164 -1 ÂµM and 0.233-0.522 ÂµM, respectively.

Pediatrics/Neonatology,Arnuity Ellipta (fluticasone furoate inhalation powder),"General Information
Arnuity Ellipta contains the active component fluticasone furoate, a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity.
Arnuity Ellipta is specifically indicated for the once-daily maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy in patients aged 12 years and older. Arnuity Ellipta is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.
Arnuity Ellipta is supplied as a powder for oral inhalation. Arnuity Ellipta should be administered as 1 inhalation once daily by the orally inhaled route. Arnuity Ellipta should be used at the same time every day. Do not use more than 1 time every 24 hours. The starting dosage is based upon patientsâ€™ asthma severity. The usual recommended starting dose for patients not on an inhaled corticosteroid is 100 mcg. For other patients, the starting dose should be based on previous asthma drug therapy and disease severity. For patients who do not respond to Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg after 2 weeks of therapy, replacement with Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg may provide additional asthma control. The highest recommended daily dose is 200 mcg.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Arnuity Ellipta was based on four confirmatory trials of 3 and 6 monthsâ€™ duration and three dose-ranging trials of 8 weeksâ€™ duration in 3,611 subjects with asthma.
Dose-ranging trials
Eight doses of fluticasone furoate ranging from 25 to 800 mcg once daily were evaluated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week trials in subjects with asthma. Across the 3 trials, subjects were uncontrolled at baseline on treatments of short-acting beta2-agonist and/or non-inhaled corticosteroid controller medications (Trial 687), low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (Trial 685), or medium doses of inhaled corticosteroid (Trial 684). A dose-related increase in trough FEV1 at Week 8 was seen for doses from 25 to 200 mcg with no consistent additional benefit for doses above 200 mcg. To evaluate dosing frequency, a separate trial compared fluticasone furoate 200 mcg once daily, fluticasone furoate 100 mcg twice daily, fluticasone propionate 100 mcg twice daily, and fluticasone propionate 200 mcg once daily. The results supported the the selection of the once-daily dosing frequency.
Confirmatory Trials
Four confirmatory trials were conducted in adolescent and adult subjects aged 12 years and older with asthma. The trials were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Arnuity Ellipta given once daily in the evening on lung function in subjects who were not controlled on their current treatments of inhaled corticosteroids, or combination therapy consisting of an inhaled corticosteroid plus a LABA. Study treatments were delivered as inhalation powders. The primary endpoint in all trials was change from baseline in evening trough FEV1 measured approximately 24 hours after the final dose of study medication. Trials 2 and 4 had a co=primary endpoint of change from baseline in weighted mean serial FEV1 measured after the final dose of study medication at 5, 15, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 16, 20, 23, and 24 hours post-dose.
Trial 1: Trial 1 was a 24-week trial that evaluated the efficacy of Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg compared with placebo on lung function in subjects with asthma. Inhaled fluticasone propionate 250 mcg twice daily was given as a control. Of the 343 enrolled subjects 35% of subjects on placebo and 19% of subjects on Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg failed to complete the 24-week trial. The mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 was greater among subjects receiving Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg than among those receiving placebo (mean treatment difference from placebo 146 mL; 95% CI: 36, 257.
Trial 2: Trial 2 was a 12-week trial that evaluated the efficacy of Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg on lung function in subjects with asthma compared with placebo. The combination of fluticasone furoate 100 mcg and vilanterol 25 mcg was also included as a treatment arm. Of the 609 enrolled subjects, 26% of subjects on placebo and 10% of subjects on Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg failed to complete the 12-week trial. Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg once daily had greater mean changes from baseline in trough FEV1 than placebo throughout the trial. At Week 12 or the last available on-treatment visit prior to Week 12, the mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 was greater among subjects receiving Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg once daily than among those receiving placebo (mean treatment difference 136 mL; 95% CI: 51, 222). Lung function improvements were sustained over the 24-hour period following the final dose of Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg. Compared with placebo, at Week 12 the change from baseline in weighted mean FEV1 was significantly greater for Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg (mean treatment difference 186 mL; 95% CI: 62, 310).
Subjects in both Trials 1 and 2 receiving Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg once daily had a greater improvement from baseline in percentage of 24-hour periods without need of beta2-agonist rescue medication use than subjects receiving placebo.
Trial 3: Trial 3 was a 24-week trial that evaluated the relative efficacy of Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg and Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg on lung function in subjects with asthma. Of the 219 enrolled subjects, 16% on Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg and 13% of subjects on Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg failed to complete the 24-week trial. There were trends toward greater mean changes from baseline in the group receiving Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg than the group receiving Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg throughout the trial. At Week 24 or the last available on-treatment visit prior to Week 24, the mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 was 208 mL for Arnuity Ellipta 100 mcg, as compared to 284 mL for Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg (difference of 77 mL; 95% CI: -39, 192).
Trial 4: Trial 4 was a 24-week trial that evaluated the efficacy of Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg once daily and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily on lung function in 586 subjects with asthma. Both Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg once daily and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily produced improvement from baseline in lung function. At Week 24 the mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 was 201 mL for Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg once daily and 183 mL for fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily (treatment difference of 18 mL, 95% CI: -66, 102). Lung function improvements were sustained over the 24-hour period following the final dose of Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg. At Week 24, the change from baseline in weighted mean FEV1 was 328 mL for Arnuity Ellipta 200 mcg once daily and 258 mL for fluticasone propionate 500 twice daily (difference of 70 mL; 95% CI: -67, 208).

Arnuity Ellipta contains the active component fluticasone furoate, a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. The precise mechanism of corticosteroid action on asthma is not known. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma.

Pediatrics/Neonatology,Banzel (rufinamide),"General Information
Banzel is a triazole derivative. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. However, it is thought that rufinamide modulates the activity of sodium channels and, in particular, prolongation of the inactive state of the channel.
Banzel is specifically indicated for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children 4 years and older and adults.
Banzel is supplied as a 200mg or 400mg tablet for oral administration.
The recommended initial dose of the drug for pediatrics aged four years and older with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a daily dose of approximately 10 mg/kg/day administered in two equally divided doses. The dose should be increased by approximately 10 mg/kg increments every other day to a target dose of 45 mg/kg/day or 3200 mg/day, whichever is less, administered in two equally divided doses.
The recommended initial dose of the drug for adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a daily dose of 400 to 800 mg/day administered in two equally divided doses. The dose should be increased by 400 to 800 mg/day every 2 days until a maximum daily dose of 3200 mg/day, administered in two equally divided doses is reached.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Banzel was based on the results of a single clinical trial. This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study enrolled 138 subjects, between 4 and 30 years of age, with inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS. All subjects were being treated with 1 to 3 concomitant stable dose anti-epileptic drugs. After completing a 4-week baseline phase on stable therapy, the subjects were randomized to have Banzel or placebo added to their ongoing therapy during a 12 week double-blind phase. This double-blind phase consisted of two periods: the Titration Period (1 to 2 weeks) and the Maintenance Period (10 weeks). During the Titration Period, the dose was increased to a target dosage of approximately 45 mg/kg/day (3200 mg in adults of > 70kg), given on a twice daily schedule. Final doses at titration were to remain stable during the maintenance period. The median percentage reduction in total seizure frequency from baseline was greater in the rufinamide therapy group than in the placebo group (32.7% versus 11.7%; p<0.002). The rufinamide-treated subjects had 42.5% median percentage reduction in tonic-atonic seizure (drop attack) frequency per 28 days from baseline as compared with 1.4% increase in the placebo-treated subjects (p<0.0001). The rufinamide group had a statistically significant improvement in seizure severity (p<0.005) and a higher percentage of subjects who experienced at least a 50% reduction in tonic-atonic seizure frequency per 28 days compared with placebo (42.5% versus 16.7; p=0.002).

Pediatrics/Neonatology,Benlysta (belimumab),"General Information
Benlysta (belimumab) is a human IgG 1 Ã€ monoclonal antibody specific for soluble human B lymphocyte stimulator protein (BLyS). Elevated levels of BLyS are seen in the blood or joint fluid of patients with autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.
Benlysta is specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive, systemic lupus erythematosus who are receiving standard therapy. Benlysta intravenous (IV) infusion is also indicated for use in pediatrics 5 years of age and older with systemic lupus erythematosus.
Benlysta is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion. It must be reconstituted and diluted prior to intravenous administration The recommended initial dose is 10 mg/kg at 2-week intervals for the first 3 doses and at 4-week intervals thereafter. It should be administered as an intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops an infusion reaction.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Benlysta was based on three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies involving 2,133 patients with SLE.
Trial 1: Benlysta 1 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg
Trial 1 enrolled 449 subjects and evaluated doses of 1, 4, and 10 mg/kg Benlysta plus standard of care compared with placebo plus standard of care over 52 weeks. The co-primary endpoints were percent change in SELENA-SLEDAI score at Week 24 and time to first flare over 52 weeks. No significant differences between any of the Benlysta groups and the placebo group were observed. Exploratory analysis of this study identified a subgroup of subjects (72%), who were autoantibody positive, in whom Benlysta appeared to offer benefit. The results of this study informed the design of Trials 2 and 3 and led to the selection of a target population and indication that is limited to autoantibody-positive SLE patients.
Trials 2 and 3: Benlysta 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg
Trials 2 and 3 were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with SLE that were similar in design except - Trial 2 was 76 weeks duration and was conducted in North America and Europe.and Trial 3 was 52 weeks duration and was conducted in South America, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Australia. At screening, subjects were stratified by disease severity based on their SELENA-SLEDAI score, proteinuria level and race (African or Indigenous-American descent vs. other), and then randomly assigned to receive Benlysta 1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or placebo in addition to standard of care. Treatment was administered intravenously over a 1-hour period on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days for 48 weeks in Trial 3 and for 72 weeks in Trial 2. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite endpoint (SLE Responder Index or SRI) that defined response as meeting each of the following criteria at Week 52 compared with baseline:
â‰¥4-point reduction in the SELENA-SLEDAI score, and
no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A organ domain score or 2 new BILAG B organ domain scores, and
no worsening (<0.30-point increase) in Physicianâ€™s Global Assessment (PGA) score
In both Trials 2 and 3, the proportion of SLE patients achieving an SRI response, as defined for the primary endpoint, was significantly higher in the Benlysta 10 mg/kg group than in the placebo group. The trends in comparisons between the treatment groups for the rates of response for the individual components of the endpoint were generally consistent with that of the SRI. At Week 76 in Trial 2, the SRI response rate with Benlysta 10 mg/kg was not significantly different from that of placebo (39% and 32%, respectively).
The efficacy of Benlysta IV for the treatment of SLE in pediatric patients was studied over 52 weeks in 93 pediatric patients with SLE. The proportion of pediatric patients achieving the composite primary endpoint, the SLE response index (SRI-4), was higher in pediatric patients receiving Benlysta IV plus standard therapy compared to placebo plus standard therapy. Pediatric patients who received Benlysta IV plus standard therapy also had a lower risk of experiencing a severe flare, as well as longer duration of time until a severe flare (160 days versus 82 days). The drug's safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in pediatric patients were consistent with those in adults with SLE.

Benlysta (belimumab) is a human IgG 1 Ã€ monoclonal antibody specific for soluble human B lymphocyte stimulator protein (BLyS). It blocks the binding of soluble BLyS, a B-cell survival factor, to its receptors on B cells. Benlysta does not bind B cells directly, but by binding BLyS, it inhibits the survival of B cells, including auto reactive B cells, and reduces the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells.

Pediatrics/Neonatology,Berinert (C1 Esterase Inhibitor (Human)),"General Information
Berinet is a human plasma derived, purified, pasteurized, lyophilized concentrate of the protein C1 esterase inhibitor. HAE is caused by the poor functioning of C1 that is present in the plasma and helps control inflammation (swelling) and parts of the immune system.
Berinert is specifically indicated for the treatment of acute abdominal or facial attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adult and adolescent patients.
Berinert is supplied as a freeze-dried powder for reconstitution for intravenous administration. The recommended initial dose is 20 units per kg body weight by intravenous injection.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Berinert was based on a placebo-controlled, double-blind, prospective, multinational, randomized, parallel-group, dose-finding, three-arm, clinical study. This study enrolled 124 adult and pediatric subjects with C1 Esterase Inhibitor deficiency who were experiencing an acute moderate to severe attack of abdominal or facial HAE. The subjects were randomized to receive a single 10 unit/kg body weight dose of Berinert, a single 20 unit/kg dose of Berinert or a single dose of placebo by slow intravenous infusion (recommended to be given at a rate of approximately 4 mL per minute) within 5 hours of an attack. If a subject experienced no relief or insufficient relief of symptoms by 4 hours after infusion, investigators had the option to administer a second infusion of Berinert (20 units/kg for the placebo group, 10 units/kg for the 10 units/kg group), or placebo (for the 20 units/kg group). This masked (blinded) rescue study medication was administered to subjects and they were then followed until complete resolution of symptoms was achieved. The objectives were to evaluate whether Berinert shortens the time to onset of relief of symptoms of an abdominal or facial attack compared to placebo and to compare the efficacy of two different doses of Berinert. Subjects treated with 20 units/kg body weight of Berinert experienced a significant reduction (pâ‰¡0.0016) in time to onset of relief from symptoms of an HAE attack as compared to placebo (median of 50 minutes for Berinert 20 units/kg body weight, as compared to >4 hours for placebo). The time to onset of relief from symptoms of an HAE attack for subjects in the 10 unit/kg dose of Berinert was not statistically significantly different from that of subjects in the placebo group. In addition, the efficacy of Berinert 20 units/kg body weight could be confirmed by observing a reduction in the intensity of single HAE symptoms at an earlier time compared to placebo. Both the proportion of subjects with increased intensity of clinical HAE symptoms between 2 and 4 hours after start of treatment compared to baseline, and the number of vomiting episodes within 4 hours after start of study treatment demonstrated trends in favor of Berinert in comparison to placebo (p values < 0.1). No subjects treated with Berinert at 20 units/kg body weight reported worsening of symptoms at 4 hours after administration of study medication compared to baseline.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Berinert may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Subsequent HAE attack
Headache

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Berinert or abdominal or facial attacks of hereditary angioedema, please visit the Berinert web page.","Mechanism of Action
Berinet is a human plasma derived, purified, pasteurized, lyophilized concentrate of C1 esterase inhibitor to be reconstituted for intravenous administration. C1 esterase inhibitor is a normal constituent of human plasma and belongs to the group serine protease inhibitors (serpins). C1 esterase inhibitor has an important inhibiting potential on several of the major cascade systems of the human body including the complement system, the intrinsic coagulation (contact) system, the fibrinolytic system, and the coagulation cascade. HAE patients have low levels of endogenous or functional C1 esterase inhibitor. Although the events that induce attacks of angioedema in HAE patients are not well defined, it has been postulated that increased vascular permeability and the clinical manifestation of HAE attacks may be primarily mediated through contact system activation.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Rituxan or pemphigus vulgaris, please visit https://www.rituxan.com/","Mechanism of Action
Rituxan (rituximab) is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen expressed on the surface of pre-B and mature B-lymphocytes. Upon binding to CD20, rituximab mediates B-cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production.

Xarelto (rivaroxaban) is a factor Xa inhibitor.
Xarelto is specifically indicated for use in combination with aspirin, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke) in patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease (PAD).
Xarelto is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is this population is 2.5 mg orally twice daily, with or without food, in combination with aspirin (75-100 mg) once daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xarelto for risk reduction of major cardiovascular (CV) events in people with chronic coronary or peripheral artery disease was based on COMPASS, a Phase 3 clinical study of 27,395 patients with chronic CAD or PAD from 33 countries. The trial examined the use of Xarelto, alone or in combination with aspirin, for the long-term prevention of major adverse CV events, including heart attack, stroke and CV death. Results showed a significant 24% reduction of the risk of major CV events in patients with chronic CAD and/or PAD with the Xarelto 2.5-mg vascular dose twice daily plus aspirin 100 mg once daily, compared to aspirin alone. Specifically data showed a 42% reduction in stroke, 22% reduction in CV death and 14% reduction in heart attack. The risk of major bleeding was significantly higher in patients taking the Xarelto/aspirin regimen compared to aspirin alone, with no significant increase in fatal or intracranial bleeds.
","Side Effects
The most common adverse effect associated with the use of Xarelto is bleeding.
The Xarelto drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning:
(A) Premature discontinuation of Xarelto increases the risk of thrombotic events Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including Xarelto, increases the risk of thrombotic events. To reduce this risk, consider coverage with another anticoagulant if Xarelto is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy. (B) Spinal/epidural hematoma Epidural or spinal hematomas have occurred in patients treated with Xarelto who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment and if observed, treat urgently. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients who are or who need to be anticoagulated.
","Additional Information

Peyronie's Disease,Xiaflex (collagenase clostridium histolyticum),"General Information
Xiaflex contains purified collagenase clostridium histolyticum. When injected directly into a Dupuytrenâ€™s cord, it enzymatically disrupts collagen. As a result of collagen disruption, contracture may be reduced and range of motion may be improved.
Xiaflex is specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Dupuytrenâ€™s contracture with a palpable cord.
Xiaflex is supplied as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution with the provided diluent. It is injected directly into the Dupuytrenâ€™s cord. The recommended initial dose is 0.58 mg per injection into a palpable cord with a contracture of a metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint or a proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. Approximately 24 hours after injection, a finger extension procedure should be performed if a contracture persists to facilitate cord disruption. Four weeks after the Xiaflex injection and finger extension procedure, if a MP or PIP contracture remains, the cord may be re-injected with a single dose of 0.58 mg of Xiaflex and the finger extension procedure may be repeated (approximately 24 hours after injection). Injections and finger extension procedures may be administered up to 3 times per cord at approximately 4-week intervals.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xiaflex was based on two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centered trials in 374 adults with Dupuytrenâ€™s contracture (Studies 1 and 2). The cord affecting the selected primary joint received up to 3 injections of 0.58 mg of Xiaflex or placebo on Days 0, 30, and 60. About 24 hours after each injection of study medication, if needed, the investigator manipulated (extended) the treated finger in an attempt to facilitate rupture of the cord (finger extension procedure). Following manipulation, patients were fitted with a splint, instructed to wear the splint at bedtime for up to 4 months, and instructed to perform a series of finger flexion and extension exercises each day. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the proportion of patients who achieved a reduction in contracture of the selected primary joint (MP or PIP) to within 0Â° to 5Â° of normal, 30 days after the last injection of that joint on Days 30, 60, or 90 (after up to 3 injections). A greater proportion of Xiaflex-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients achieved the primary endpoint. Following the first injection, the proportion of patients who achieved a contracture reduction of the primary joint to 0Â° to 5Â° was 39% and 1% in Study 1 and 27% and 5% in Study 2 in the Xiaflex and placebo groups respectively. Following up to three injections, the percentage of patients who achieved reduction in contracture of all joints (MP and PIP) to 0Â° to 5Â° was 64% and 7% in Study I and 44% and 5% in Study 2 in the Xiaflex and placebo groups respectively.

In a multicenter, randomized, parallel, double-blind, controlled clinical trial of 694 patients, the efficacy and safety of a single dose of oral netupitant in combination with oral palonosetron was compared with a single oral dose of palonosetron in cancer patients receiving a chemotherapy regimen that included cisplatin (median dose=75 mg/m2). The efficacy of Akynzeo was assessed in 135 patients who received Akynzeo (netupitant 300 mg and palonosetron 0.5 mg) and 136 patients who received oral palonosetron 0.5 mg. The efficacy endpoints were complete response (CR) (defined as no emetic episode and no use of rescue medication) for the 25-120 hour interval (delayed phase), CR for the 0-24 hour interval (acute phase), and CR within 120 hours (overall phase) after the start of the chemotherapy administration.
Complete Response- Delayed Phase: Akynzeo 90.4% and Palonosetron 80.1% (p-0.032)
Complete Response- Acute Phase: Akynzeo 98.5% and Palonosetron 89.7% (p- 0.002)
Complete Response- Overall Phase: Akynzeo 89.6% and Palonosetron 76.5% (p- 0.003)
Trial Two
In a multicenter, randomized, parallel, double-blind, active controlled, superiority trial, the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of Akynzeo was compared with a single oral dose of palonosetron 0.5 mg in cancer patients scheduled to receive the first cycle of an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) regimen for the treatment of a solid malignant tumor. All patients received a single oral dose of dexamethasone. After completion of cycle 1, patients had the option to participate in a multiple-cycle extension, receiving the same treatment as assigned in cycle 1. There was no pre-specified limit of the number of repeat consecutive cycles for any patient. A total of 1455 patients were randomized to the Akynzeo arm or palonosetron arm. A total of 1450 patients (Akynzeo n=725; palonosetron n=725) received study medication: of these, 1438 patients (98.8%) completed cycle 1 and 1286 patients (88.4%) continued treatment in the multiple-cycle extension. A total of 907 patients (62.3%) completed the multiple-cycle extension up to a maximum of eight treatment cycles. The primary efficacy endpoint was the CR rate in the delayed phase, 25-120 hours after the start of chemotherapy administration. Complete response in the Delayed Phase was achieved by 76.9% of the subjects in the Akynzeo arm and 69.5% in the Palonosetron arm (p - 0.001).

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Akynzeo or chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, please visit www.akynzeo.com","Mechanism of Action
Akynzeo is a fixed combination of netupitant and palonosetron. Netupitant is a selective antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. Delayed emesis has been largely associated with the activation of tachykinin family neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors (broadly distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems) by substance P. In in vitro and in vivo studies, netupitant inhibits substance P mediated responses. Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. Chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by stimulating the release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. Serotonin then activates 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. The development of acute emesis is known to depend on serotonin and its 5-HT3 receptors have been demonstrated to selectively stimulate the emetic response.

Pharmacology/Toxicology,"Andexxa (coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo)","General Information
Adexxa (andexanet alfa) works by acting as a decoy for Factor Xa inhibitors in the blood, thereby preventing them from inhibiting the activity of native Factor Xa. As a result, the native Factor Xa is available to participate in the coagulation process and restore hemostasis (normal clotting).
Andexxa is specifically indicated for patients treated with rivaroxaban and apixaban, when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding.
Andexxa is supplied as a lyophilized powder for solution for intravenous injection. Dose Andexxa based on the specific FXa inhibitor, dose of FXa inhibitor, and time since the patientâ€™s last dose of FXa inhibitor. Administer as an intravenous (IV) bolus, with a target rate of 30 mg/min, followed by continuous infusion for up to 120 minutes.There are two dosing regimens: Low Dose: Initial IV Bolus: 400 mg at a target rate of 30 mg/min 4 mg/min for up to 120 minutes. Follow-On IV Infusion: 4mg/min for up to 120 minutes. High Dose: Initial IV Bolus: 800 mg at a target rate of 30 mg/min. Follow-On IV Infusion: 8mg/min for up to 120 minutes.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Andexxa was approved under the FDA's Accelerated Approval pathway. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon post-marketing study results to demonstrate an improvement in hemostasis in patients. The FDA approval of Andexxa was based on data from two Phase III ANNEXA studies (ANNEXA-R and ANNEXA-A) , which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Andexxa in reversing the anticoagulant activity of the Factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban in healthy subjects. Results demonstrated that Andexxa rapidly and significantly reversed anti-Factor Xa activity (the anticoagulant mechanism of these medicines). The median decrease in anti-Factor Xa activity from baseline was 97 percent for rivaroxaban and 92 percent for apixaban. Interim data from the ongoing ANNEXA-4 single-arm, open-label study in patients with major bleeding also were assessed by the FDA as part of its review and approval. Data from 185 evaluable patients showed that Andexxa rapidly and significantly reversed anti-Factor Xa activity when administered as a bolus and sustained this reversal when followed by a 120-minute infusion. The median decrease from baseline was 90 percent for rivaroxaban and 93 percent for apixaban.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Andexxa may include, but are not limited to, the following:
urinary tract infections
pneumonia
The Andexxa label comes with the following Boxed Warning:
Treatment with Andexxa has been associated with serious and life-threatening adverse events, including: Arterial and venous thromboembolic events. Ischemic events, including myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.Cardiac arrest. Sudden deaths. Monitor for thromboembolic events and initiate anticoagulation when medically appropriate. Monitor for symptoms and signs that precede cardiac arrest and provide treatment as needed.
","Additional Information

Andexxa is a recombinant protein specifically designed to bind to Factor Xa inhibitors and rapidly reverse their anticoagulant effect. Andexxa is a modified form of the human Factor Xa molecule, an enzyme that helps blood clot. Andexxa works by acting as a decoy for oral and injectable Factor Xa inhibitors, which target and bind to Factor Xa, which allows them to exert their anticoagulant effect. When Andexxa is given to a patient with Factor Xa inhibitor-related bleeding, it binds to the Factor Xa inhibitor and prevents it from inhibiting the activity of Factor Xa and reverses the anticoagulant effects of the inhibitor.

Pharmacology/Toxicology,Bridion (sugammadex),"General Information
Bridion (sugammadex) is a modified gamma cyclodextrin.
Bridion is specifically indicated for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium and vecuronium in adults undergoing surgery.
Bridion is supplied as an injection for intravenous administration. Monitor for twitch responses to determine the timing and dose for Bridion administration. The recommended dose is as follows:
For rocuronium and vecuronium:
4 mg/kg is recommended if spontaneous recovery of the twitch response has reached 1 to 2 post-tetanic counts (PTC) and there are no twitch responses to train-of-four (TOF) stimulation.
2 mg/kg is recommended if spontaneous recovery has reached the reappearance of the second twitch in response to TOF stimulation.
For rocuronium only:
16 mg/kg is recommended if there is a clinical need to reverse neuromuscular blockade soon (approximately 3 minutes) after administration of a single dose of 1.2 mg/kg of rocuronium.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Bridion was based on the following studies:
Comparative Study of Bridion versus Neostigmine as a Reversal Agent for Neuromuscular Blockade Induced by Rocuronium or Vecuronium at Reappearance of T2 (Moderate Blockade):
A multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, safety-assessor blinded study comparing Bridion and neostigmine enrolled 189 subjects. The subjects were randomly assigned to the rocuronium or vecuronium group and underwent elective surgical procedures under general anesthesia that required endotracheal intubation and maintenance of neuromuscular blockade. At the reappearance of T2, after the last dose of rocuronium or vecuronium, 2 mg/kg Bridion or 50 mcg/kg neostigmine was administered in a randomized order as a single bolus injection. The time from start of administration of Bridion or neostigmine to recovery of the TOF (T4/T1) ratio to 0.9 was assessed. Generally, a T4/T1 ratio â‰¥0.9 correlates with recovery from neuromuscular blockade. Return of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 after the reappearance of T2 was overall faster with Bridion 2 mg/kg as compared to neostigmine 50 mcg/kg in the setting of rocuronium or vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade.
Comparative Study of Bridion versus Neostigmine as a Reversal Agent for Neuromuscular Blockade Induced by Rocuronium or Vecuronium at 1 to 2 PTCs (Deep Blockade)
One hundred fifty-seven patients were evaluated in a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled safety assessor-blinded clinical study. In the study, patients received either rocuronium or vecuronium and underwent elective surgical procedures under general anesthesia that required endotracheal intubation and maintenance of neuromuscular blockade. At 1-2 PTCs (deep block), after the last dose of rocuronium or vecuronium, 4 mg/kg Bridion or 70 mcg/kg neostigmine was administered. The time from the start of administration of Bridion or neostigmine to recovery of the train-of-four (T4/T1) ratio of 0.9 was assessed. Generally, a T4/T1 ratio â‰¥0.9 correlates with recovery from neuromuscular blockade. Neostigmine was not expected to reverse neuromuscular blockade at a depth of 1-2 PTCs. The subjects treated with Bridion achieved rapid recovery of neuromuscular function from rocuronium-induced (n=37) deep block (1-2 PTCs) in a median time of 2.7 minutes with a 25th and 75th percentiles of 2.1 and 4.3 minutes respectively, and from vecuronium-induced (n=47) deep block in a median time of 3.3 minutes with a 25th and 75th percentiles of 2.3 and 6.6 minutes, respectively. There were 7 and 6 censored observations in the rocuronium and vecuronium groups, respectively.

Pharmacology/Toxicology,Campral (acamprosate calcium),"General Information
Campral (acamprosate) is a structural analogue of the amino acid homotaurine and the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). While it's specific mechanism of action is not entirely understood, neurotransmossion systems involving GABA and it's excitatory counterpart glutamate are observed to be thrown out of equilibrium when chronically exposed to alcohol; Campral, by mimicing GABA's actions and interacting with these systems directly, is thought to help restore this equilibrium.
It is specifically indicated for the maintenance of abstinence from alcohol in patients with alcohol dependence who are abstinent at treatment initiation. It has not been established as effective for initiating abstinence in patients who have not done so on their own prior to taking the drug, and it was designed to be a portion of a full behavioral and pharmacological treatment program. Campral has also not been shown to be effective in patients with multiple subtance dependencies including alcohol.
Campral is administered as an oral tablet, with a recommended dosage of two tablets (each containing 333 mg of Campral) thrice daily.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Campral was based on three double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies enrolling a combined total of 998 subjects. The trials ranged from 90 to 360 days, with all subjects receiving at least one dose of Campral or placebo. All subjects had a history of alcohol abuse and dependence, and all had undergone inpatient detoxification and were abstinent from alcohol on the day of randomization. All subjects received their treatment in combination with standard psychosocial couselling. In all three studies, treatment with Campral yielded a greater portion of subjects maintaining abstinence than with placebo.
A fourth clinical study invesigated the efficacy of Campral in subjects with multiple substance dependencies, and in patients who had not established abstinence prior to dosing. In these studies, Campral was not shown to be superior to placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Campral may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Diarrhea
Nausea
Flatulence
Pruritus
In addition to these events, acute kidney failure was observed in 3 subjects during the trials. A causal role of Campral has not been found, and it has not been determined if these events were relevant to clinical treatment.

Campral (acamprosate) is a structural analogue of the amino acid homotaurine, the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and the neuromodulatory amino acid taurine. The drug's specific mechanism of action is not entirely understood, but it is thought to help restore GABA-glutamate equilibrium by acting specifically on sites of alcohol dependence. It has been shown to have little to no additional CNS activity, and did not demonstrate significant behavioral effects (depression, anxiety, dizziness, etc.) significantly more often than placebo.

Egrifta contains tesamorelin, an analog of human growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF). Tesamorelin binds and stimulates human GRF receptors with similar potency as the endogenous GRF. Growth hormone-releasing factor is a hypothalamic peptide that acts on the pituitary somatotroph cells to stimulate the synthesis and pulsatile release of endogenous growth hormone, which is both anabolic and lipolytic.
Egrifta is specifically indicated for the reduction of excess abdominal fat in HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy.
Egrifta is supplied as a sterile, white to off-white lyophilized powder for reconstitution designed for subcutaneous administration. The recommended initial dose is 2 mg injected subcutaneously once a day. The recommended injection site is the abdomen. Injection sites should be rotated to different areas of the abdomen. Egrifta should not be injected into scar tissue, bruises or the navel.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Egrifta was based on two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy and excess abdominal fat (abdominal lipohypertrophy). Both studies consisted of a 26-week Main Phase and a 26-week Extension Phase. The subjects were randomized to receive 2 mg Egrifta or placebo subcutaneously daily for 26 weeks. The primary efficacy assessment for each of these studies was the percent change from baseline to Week 26 (Main Phase) in visceral adipose tissue (cm2), as assessed by computed tomography (CT) scan at L4-L5 vertebral level. In both studies, Egrifta- treated patients completing the 26-week treatment period were re-randomized to blinded therapy with either daily placebo or 2 mg Egrifta for an additional 26-week treatment period (Extension Phase) in order to assess maintenance of VAT reduction and to gather long-term safety data.
Study One
Main Phase
This study randomized 412 subjects. At Week 26, treatment with Egrifta resulted in a reduction from baseline in mean trunk fat of 1.0 kg compared with an increase of 0.4 kg in the placebo group. In addition, Egrifta resulted in an increase from baseline in mean lean body mass of 1.3 kg compared with a decrease of 0.2 kg in the placebo group.
Extension Phase
This study re-randomized 207 subjects. Those treated with Egrifta showed no change between Weeks 26 and 52 in mean trunk fat (increase of 0.1 kg vs. increase of 1.4 kg in placebo group) nor was there a change from Week 26 baseline in mean lean body mass (decrease of 0.1 kg vs. decrease of 1.8 kg in placebo group).
Study Two
Main Phase
This study randomized 404 subjects. At Week 26, treatment with Egrifta resulted in a reduction from baseline in mean trunk fat of 0.8 kg compared with an increase of 0.2 kg in the placebo group. In addition, Egrifta resulted in an increase from baseline in mean lean body mass of 1.2 kg compared with a decrease of 0.03 kg in the placebo group.
Extension Phase
This study re-randomized 177 subjects. Those treated with Egrifta showed no change between Weeks 26 and 52 in mean trunk fat (decrease of 0.5 kg vs. an increase of 1.09 kg in placebo group) nor was there a change from Week 26 baseline in mean lean body mass (increase of 0.1 kg vs. decrease of 1.7 kg in placebo group).

Pharmacology/Toxicology,Fusilev (levoleucovorin),"General Information
Fusilev is a folate analog injection. Fusilev protects against the toxic effects of methotrexate, which is a type of chemotherapy that prevents folates from being metabolized to the reduced active form , therefore leading to cell death. Specifically, methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist which binds and inhibits one enzyme involved in an early step of the activation of folic acid to folinic acid. The administration of Fusilev, therefore, bypasses the metabolic block effected by methotrexate.
Fusilev is specifically indicated after high-dose methotrexate therapy in osteosarcoma and to diminish the toxicity and counteract the effects of impaired methotrexate elimination and of inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists.
Fusilev is supplied as a powder for reconsitution into a solution for intravenous administration. The recommended dosages are based on a methotrexate dose of 12 grams/m2 administered by intravenous infusion over 4 hours. Fusilev rescue at a dose of 7.5 mg (approximately 5 mg/m2) every 6 hours for 10 doses starts 24 hours after the beginning of the methotrexate infusion. Fusilev administration, hydration, and urinary alkalinization (pH of 7.0 or greater) should be continued until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10-8 M (0.05 micromolar).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The safety and efficacy of Fusilev rescue following high-dose methotrexate were evaluated in 16 patients age 6-21 who received 58 courses of therapy for osteogenic sarcoma. High-dose methotrexate was one component of several different combination chemotherapy regimens evaluated across several trials. Methotrexate 12 g/m2 IV over 4 hours was administered to 13 patients, who received Fusilev 7.5 mg every 6 hours for 60 hours or longer beginning 24 hours after completion of methotrexate. Three patients received methotrexate 12.5 g/m2 IV over 6 hours, followed by Fusilev 7.5 mg every 3 hours for 18 doses beginning 12 hours after completion of methotrexate. The mean number of Fusilev doses per course was 18.2 and the mean total dose per course was 350 mg. The efficacy of Fusilev rescue following high-dose methotrexate was based on the adverse reaction profile.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Fusilev or the adverse effects of methotrexate therapy, please visit the Fusilev web page.","Mechanism of Action
Fusilev is a folate analog injection containing the active isomer of leucovorin (also called folinic acid), which is made up of a mixture of two isomers, one active, and one inactive. Folates are a group of vitamins that allow cells to reproduce. Specifically, they fuel the synthesis of purinic and pyrimidinic bases, the building blocks of DNA. Cells need to duplicate their own DNA before they can divide. Folate deficiency hinders DNA synthesis and cell division, most notably affecting rapidly proliferating tissues, such as normal bone marrow and cancer tissue. Fusilev was designed to protect against the toxic effects of methotrexate, a type of chemotherapy that prevents folates from being metabolized to the reduced active form, therefore leading to cell death.

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Kcentra was based on a randomized, controlled Phase IIIb study in 212 evaluable subjects. The study compared Kcentra (4-factor PCC) and vitamin K with plasma and vitamin K for urgent warfarin reversal in patients with acute major bleeding. Kcentra achieved the endpoints of hemostatic efficacy with respect to the adequacy of stopping a major bleed assessed at 24 hours from the start of infusion (72.4% of patients receiving Kcentra versus 65.4% receiving plasma) and INR reduction (1.3) at 30 minutes post treatment (62.2% of patients receiving Kcentra versus 9.6% receiving plasma). The secondary endpoints included plasma levels of major clotting factors (Factors II, VII, IX, X, proteins C and S); time to INR correction; and safety and tolerability (including all-cause mortality). A single Kcentra infusion produced a rapid and sustained increase in plasma levelsof clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X within 30 minutes post-treatment (p values<0.0001) with 87 percent less volume (105 mL +/-37 mL versus 865 mL +/- 269 mL) than plasma.

This labeling change was based in part on results from a double-blind multicenter trial in which 697 patients were randomized to receive either a single 2 mg dose of Kytril tablets or one 1 mg Kytril tablet one hour prior to chemotherapy and another 1 mg tablet 12 hours after the first tablet was given. Investigators evaluated the percentage of patients who achieved a complete response (no vomiting, no moderate or severe nausea and no rescue medication) and the incidence of emesis and nausea. Patients receiving a single 2 mg dose of Kytril tablets achieved a 64 percent response rate versus 69 percent for patients receiving Kytril tablets twice daily. This difference was not statistically significant.
","Side Effects
Kytril tablets are well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events are headache, asthenia and constipation.",,
Pharmacology/Toxicology,Lamisil (terbinafine hydrochloride) Tablets,"General Information
Lamisil has been approved as a treatment for nail fungal infections (onychomycosis). Lamisil leads to the death of the fungal cells that cause onychomycosis, as demonstrated by in vitro studies.
The course of treatment with Lamisil tablets is 12 weeks for toenail infections and 6 weeks for fingernail infections. The drug works faster than the nail grows. Therefore, it may be several months before new clear nails grow in. Lamisil is available in a once-a-day dosing with no dietary restrictions and can be taken with or without food.
","Side Effects
The most common side effects associated with Lamisil were gastrointestinal symptoms, headaches, and rash. These were generally mild and transient in nature. Lamisil is contraindicated in individuals who are hypersensitive to terbinafine. Rare instances of symptomatic hepatobiliary dysfunction and serious skin reactions have been reported. In such cases, therapy should be discontinued.
","Additional Information
Onychomycosis, one of the hardest to treat forms of external infection, aggressively discolors, thickens, and destroys the nail plate. An estimated 10 million individuals in the continental United States suffer from onychomycosis, an invasive infection of the nail caused by dermatophytes--fungi like Tricophyton rubrum and Tricophyton mentagrophytes.
People who work with their hands or on their feet, or those who are frequently exposed to detergents, perspiration, and water, are at high risk for contracting onychomycosis. Nail fungal infections are prevalent among the elderly, athletes, military personnel, and laborers, and may be more severe in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV.",
Pharmacology/Toxicology,Lucemyra (lofexidine),"General Information
Lucemyra (lofexidine) is a central alpha-2 adrenergic agonist.
Lucemyra is specifically indicated for mitigation of opioid withdrawal symptoms to facilitate abrupt opioid discontinuation in adults.
Lucemyra is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The usual starting dosage is three 0.18 mg tablets taken orally 4 times daily during the period of peak withdrawal symptoms (generally the first 5 to 7 days following last use of opioid) with dosing guided by symptoms and side effects. There should be 5 to 6 hours between each dose. The total daily dosage of Lucemyra should not exceed 2.88 mg (16 tablets) and no single dose should exceed 0.72 mg (4 tablets). Lucemyra treatment may be continued for up to 14 days with dosing guided by symptoms. Discontinue Lucemyra with a gradual dose reduction over a 2- to 4-day period to mitigate Lucemyra withdrawal symptoms.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Lucemyra was based on two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.
Study 1
Study 1 was a 2-part efficacy, safety, and dose-response study conducted in the United States in patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence who were physically dependent on short-acting opioids (e.g., heroin, hydrocodone, oxycodone). The first part of the study was an inpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design consisting of 7 days of inpatient treatment (Days 1-7) with Lucemyra 2.16 mg total daily dose (0.54 mg 4 times daily) (n=229), Lucemyra 2.88 mg total daily dose (0.72 mg 4 times daily) (n=222), or matching placebo (n=151). Patients also had access to a variety of support medications for withdrawal symptoms.The second part of the study (Days 8-14) was an open-label design where all patients who successfully completed Days 1-7 were eligible to receive open-label treatment with variable-dose Lucemyra treatment (as determined by the investigator, but not to exceed 2.88 mg total daily dose) for up to an additional 7 days (Days 8-14) in either an inpatient or outpatient setting as determined by the investigator and the patient. No patient received Lucemyra for more than 14 days. The two endpoints to support efficacy were the mean Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale of Gossop (SOWS-Gossop) total score on Days 1 â€“ 7 of treatment and the proportion of patients that completed 7 days of treatment. Of the randomized and treated patients, 28% of placebo patients, 41% of Lucemyra 2.16 mg, and 40% of Lucemyra 2.88 mg patients completed 7 days of treatment. The difference in proportion in both Lucemyra groups was significant compared to placebo. The mean SOWS-Gossop scores for Days 1 â€“ 7 were 8.8, 6.5, and 6.1 for placebo, Lucemyra 2.16 mg and Lucemyra 2.88 mg, respectively, which was also significant.
Study 2
This was an inpatient, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study carried out in the United States in patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence who were physically dependent on short-acting opioids (e.g., heroin, hydrocodone, oxycodone). Patients were treated with Lucemyra tablets (2.88 mg/day [0.72 mg four times daily]) or matching placebo for 5 days (Days 1-5). Patients also had access to a variety of support medications for withdrawal symptoms. All patients then received placebo on Days 6 and 7 and were discharged on Day 8. The two endpoints to support efficacy were the mean SOWS-Gossop total score on Days 1 â€“ 5 of treatment and the proportion of patients that completed 5 days of treatment. The SOWS-Gossop was administered at baseline and once daily 3.5 hours after the first morning dose on Days 1 â€“ 5. A total of 264 patients were randomized into the study. Of the randomized and treated patients, 33% of placebo patients and 49% of Lucemyra patients completed 5 days of treatment. The difference in proportion between the two groups was significant. The mean SOWS-Gossop scores for Days 1 â€“ 5 were 8.9 and 7.0 for placebo and Lucemyra 2.88 mg, respectively, which was statistically significant.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Lucemyra may include, but are not limited to, the following:
orthostatic hypotension

Pharmacology/Toxicology,Mesnex,"General Information
Mesnex Tablets are approved for use as a detoxifying agent to inhibit the hemorrhagic cystitis induced by Ifex (ifosfamide). This condition involves bladder problems, such as irritation due to blood being in the urine. Ifex is an antineoplastic drug used for treatment of testicular cancer. Along with Ifex, Mesnex Injection was approved for use in 1988.
Mesnex Tablets are to be used in a dosing regimen with Ifex and Mesnex Injection. If only using Mesnex Injection, the dosing regimen lasts eight hours. With the addition of Mesnex Tablets, it is reduced to six hours. Tablets also allow for quicker administration that can easily be done if not at home.
Clinical Results
Approval of Mesnex Tablets is supported by two clinical studies with over 100 cancer subjects receiving Ifex. Trials compared three intravenous doses of Mesnex to an initial intravenous dose followed by two oral doses for the prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis induced by treatment with Ifex. Both dosing regimens successfully reduced incidences of grade three or four hematuria, the primary efficacy endpoint.
Mesnex Tablets are given orally two and six hours after the co-administartion of Ifex and Mesnex Injection. Mesnex should only be prescribed along with Ifex.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Mesnex may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Nausea
Vomiting
Fatigue
Constipation
Leukopenia
Anemia
Asthenia
Because Mesnex is used in combination with Ifex, it is difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to Mesnex from those caused by Ifex.
","Additional Information
For additional information on the effects of chemotherapy, please visit National Cancer Institute.","Mechanism of Action
Mesnex (mesna) was developed as a prophylactic agent to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis induced by Ifex (ifosfamide). Mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite, mesna disulfide, which then remains in the intravascular compartment and is rapidly eliminated by the kidneys. In the kidney, mesna disulfide is reduced to mesna, which reacts with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites, resulting in their detoxification. (From Mesnex Prescribing Information)

Pneumonia,Avelox I.V. (moxifloxacin hydrochloride),"General Information
Avelox is an antibacterial agent indicated for the treatment of adults with infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the following conditions: acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community acquired pneumonia, and uncomplicated skin/skin structure infections.
The active ingredient is moxifloxacin hydrochloride. In its I.V. form, Avelox is administered as an introvenous 0.8% sodium chloride solution containing 400 mg moxifloxacin.
Avelox is also available in tablet form.
Clinical Results
A large, randomized, double-blind, contriolled clinical trial was conducted in the United States and Canada to compare the efficacy of Avelox I.V. versus an IV/PO fluroquinolone control (trovafloxacin or levofloxacin), in the treatment of community acquired pneumonia. Each of the 516 patients who were enrolled in the study were given one of the I.V. treatments over a period of 7-14 days. During the 7-30 day post-therapy visit, 362 were evaluated in the primary efficacy analysis. The Avelox therapy had a clinical success rate of 86%, while the fluroquinolone comparators had a 89% success rate.
Another study (open-label) enrolled 628 patients to compare Avelox to sequential IV/PO amoxicillin/clavulanate with or without high-dose IV/PO clarithromycin for the treatment of multiple bacteria. These comparitors are not FDA approved. At the primary efficacy timepoint (Day 5-7), the success rate of Avelox was 93%, while the comparators with or without clarithromycin had a lower success rate of 85%. During the 21-28 day post-therapy visit, the Avelox therapy showed a similar clinical superiority, with a 84% success rate, compared to 74% for the comparators.
","Side Effects
Most adverse reactions to Avelox in clinical trials were mild to moderate. Treatment was discontinued due to drug-related adverse reactions in 5.7% of patients treated sequentially (intravenous followed by oral) in the trials in which the patient population had community acquired pneumonia. The trials in which patients were treated with the tablet form of Avelox alone, saw 3.6% discontinuation due to adverse effects.
In clinical trials, the most common adverse effects were the following:
Nausea (7%)
Diarrhea (6%)
Dizziness (3%)
","Additional Information
For more information about Avelox I.V. and Avelox Tablets, please visit the following web site, sponsored by Bayer: www.Avelox.com.","Mechanism of Action
Moxifloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. The bactericidal action of moxifloxacin results from inhibition of the topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. It appears that the C8-methoxy moiety contributes to enhanced activity and lower selection of resistant mutants of Gram-positive bacteria compared to the C8-H moiety. The presence of the bulky bicycloamine substituent at the C-7 position prevents active efflux, associated with the NorA or pmrA genes seen in certain Gram-positive bacteria.
The mechanism of action for quinolones, including moxifloxacin, is different from that of macrolides, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, or tetracyclines; therfore, microorganisms resistant to these classes of drugs may be susceptible to moxifloxacin and other quinolones. There is no known cross-resistance between mosifloxacin and other classes of anitmicrobials. (From Avelox package insert)

Pneumonia,Prevnar 13 (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine),"General Information
Prevnar 13 is a sterile suspension of saccharides of the capsular antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F. B-cells produce antibodies in response to antigenic stimulation via T-dependent and T-independent mechanisms. Prevnar 13, comprised of polysaccharides conjugated to a carrier protein, elicits a T-cell dependent immune response. Protein carrier-specific T-cells provide the signals needed for maturation of the B-cell response and generation of B-cell memory. This type of response induces immune memory and elicits booster responses on re-exposure in infants and young children to pneumococcal polysaccharides.
Prevnar 13 is specifically indicated for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F and for the prevention of otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F. Prevnar 13 is approved for use in children 6 weeks through 5 years of age.
Prevnar 13 is supplied as a solution for intramuscular injection. The vaccine should be administered accordingly:

Prevnar 13 is a sterile suspension of saccharides of the capsular antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F. B-cells produce antibodies in response to antigenic stimulation via T-dependent and T-independent mechanisms. Prevnar 13, comprised of polysaccharides conjugated to a carrier protein, elicits a T-cell dependent immune response. Protein carrier-specific T-cells provide the signals needed for maturation of the B-cell response and generation of B-cell memory. This type of response induces immune memory and elicits booster responses on re-exposure in infants and young children to pneumococcal polysaccharides.

The duration of therapy should be guided by the severity and site of infection and the patientâ€™s clinical and bacteriological progress.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Zerbaxa was based on the following studies:
Complicated intra-abdominal infections:
A multinational, double-blind enrolled 979 adults hospitalized with cIAI who were randomized to Zerbaxa (ceftolozane/tazobactam 1 g/0.5 g intravenously every 8 hours) plus metronidazole (500 mg intravenously every 8 hours) or meropenem (1 g intravenously every 8 hours) for 4 to 14 days of therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical response, defined as complete resolution or significant improvement in signs and symptoms of the index infection at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit which occurred 24 to 32 days after the first dose of study drug. The primary efficacy analysis population was the microbiological intent-to-treat (MITT) population, which included all patients who had at least 1 baseline intra-abdominal pathogen regardless of the susceptibility to study drug. The MITT population consisted of 806 patients. Zerbaxa plus metronidazole was non-inferior to meropenem with regard to clinical cure rates at the TOC visit in the MITT population; 83% and 87.3%, respectively.
Complicated urinary tract infections:
A multinational, double-blind study enrolled 1,068 adults hospitalized with cUTI (including pyelonephritis) who were randomized to Zerbaxa (ceftolozane/tazobactam 1 g/0.5 g intravenously every 8 hours) or levofloxacin (750 mg intravenously once daily) for 7 days of therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as complete resolution or marked improvement of the clinical symptoms and microbiological eradication. The primary efficacy analysis population was the microbiologically modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) population, which included all patients who received study medication and had at least 1 baseline uropathogen. The mMITT population consisted of 800 patients with cUTI, including 656 (82%) with pyelonephritis. Zerbaxa demonstrated efficacy with regard to the composite endpoint of microbiological and clinical cure at the TOC visit in both the mMITT and ME populations. In the mMITT population, the composite cure rate in Zerbaxa-treated patients with concurrent bacteremia at baseline was 23/29 (79.3%). Although a statistically significant difference was observed in the Zerbaxa arm compared to the levofloxacin arm with respect to the primary endpoint, it was likely attributable to the 212/800 (26.5%) patients with baseline organisms non-susceptible to levofloxacin. Among patients infected with a levofloxacin-susceptible organism at baseline, the response rates were similar.
Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP)
A total of 726 adult patients hospitalized with HABP/VABP were enrolled in a multinational, double-blind study comparing Zerbaxa 3g (ceftolozane 2g and tazobactam 1g) intravenously every 8 hours to meropenem (1g intravenously every 8 hours) for 8 to 14 days of therapy. All patients had to be intubated and on mechanical ventilation at randomization. Efficacy was assessed based on all-cause mortality at Day 28 and clinical cure, defined as complete resolution or significant improvement in signs and symptoms of the index infection at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit which occurred 7 to 14 days after the end of treatment. The analysis population was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomized patients. Zerbaxa (ceftolozane and tazobactam) was non-inferior to meropenem for 28-day all-cause mortality in the ITT population (all randomized patients), 24.0% (87/362) and 25.3% (92/364) respectively, for a weighted proportion difference of 1.1. In addition, Zerbaxa was non-inferior to meropenem for clinical response at Test-of-Cure (7-14 days after the end of therapy) in the ITT population, 54.4% (197/362) and 53.3% (194/364) respectively, for a weighted proportion difference of 1.1. In the ventilated HABP sub-group, a favorable response for Zerbaxa in 28-day all-cause mortality was observed, 24.2% (24/99) for Zerbaxa and 37.0% (40/108) for meropenem, respectively, for a weighted proportion difference of 12.8. In the VABP subgroup, 28-day all-cause mortality was 24.0% (63/263) for Zerbaxa and 20.3% (52/256) for meropenem, for a weighted proportion difference of -3.6.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Zerbaxa or complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections, please visit www.zerbaxa.com","Mechanism of Action
Zerbaxa is a combination of ceftolozane and tazobactam. Ceftolozane belongs to the cephalosporin class of antibacterial drugs. The bactericidal action of ceftolozane results from inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis, and is mediated through binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Ceftolozane is an inhibitor of PBPs of P. aeruginosa (e.g. PBP1b, PBP1c, and PBP3) and E. coli (e.g., PBP3). Tazobactam sodium has little clinically relevant in vitro activity against bacteria due to its reduced affinity to penicillin-binding proteins. It is an irreversible inhibitor of some beta-lactamases (e.g., certain penicillinases and cephalosporinases), and can bind covalently to some chromosomal and plasmid-mediated bacterial beta-lactamases.

Pneumonia,Zosyn (sterile piperacillin sodium/tazobactam sodium),"General Information
Zosyn has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pneumonia caused by piperacillin-resistant beta-lactamase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Nosocomial pneumonia is a disease that has proven increasingly resistant to many available antibiotics.
Zosyn is an injectable antibiotic consisting of beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam, in combination with an extended-spectrum penicillin, piperacillin. The piperacillin component offers the safety and efficacy of a broad-spectrum, beta-lactam antibiotic. Tazobactam reduces the vulnerability of Zosyn to bacteria that produce beta-lactamase enzymes.
Because of its broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic organisms, Zosyn is also indicated as monotherapy for intra-abdominal infections (specifically appendicitis and peritonitis); skin and skin structure infections including cellulitis, cutaneous abscesses and ischemic/diabetic foot infections; and gynecologic infections (postpartum endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease).
Clinical Results
In a multicenter study of 300 subjects with nosocomial pneumonia, the rate of clinical cure or improvement for Zosyn plus tobramycin was 74%, compared with 50% for ceftazidime plus tobramycin (p is less than .01). The Zosyn regimen eradicated 78% of all pathogens, compared with 57% in the ceftazidime group.

Terbinafine hydrochloride is a synthetic allylamine derivative. Terbinafine hydrochloride is hypothesized to act by inhibiting the epoxidation of squalene, thus blocking the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. The allylamine derivatives, like the benzylamines, act at an earlier step in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway than the azole class of antifungal drugs. Depending on the concentration of the drug and the fungal species tested in vitro, terbinafine hydrochloride may be fungicidal. However, the clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown.

Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum, antifungal agent used for the treatment of superficial infections caused by species of pathogenic dermatophytes, yeasts, and Malassezia furfur. The mechanism of action involves inhibition of the synthesis of ergosterol, a major sterol in the fungal cell membrane. This leads to instability of the cell membrane and eventual death of the fungus.
Betamethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The exact mechanisms of action of corticosteroids in each disease are uncertain; however, betamethasone dipropionate has been shown to have dermatological and systemic pharmacologic and metabolic effects characteristic of this class of drugs.

Podiatry,Luzu (luliconazole) Cream 1%,"General Information
Luzu (luliconazole) Cream 1% is an antifungal that belongs to the azole class. Although the exact mechanism of action against dermatophytes is unknown, luliconazole appears to inhibit ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol demethylase. Inhibition of this enzymeâ€™s activity by azoles results in decreased amounts of ergosterol, a constituent of fungal cell membranes, and a corresponding accumulation of lanosterol.
Luzu is specifically indicated for the topical treatment of interdigital tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis caused by the organisms Trichophyton rubrum and Epidermophyton floccosum, in adults 18 years of age and older.
Luzu is supplied as a cream for topical administration. The recommended dose is as follows: Interdigital Tinea Pedis: Luzu Cream, 1% should be applied to the affected and immediate surrounding area(s) once a day for two weeks. Tinea Cruris and Tinea Corporis: Luzu Cream, 1% should be applied to the affected skin and immediate surrounding area(s) once a day for one week.

Subjects were randomized to receive LUZU Cream, 1% or vehicle. Subjects applied either Luzu Cream 1% or vehicle cream to the affected area and approximately 2.5 cm (1 in) of the surrounding area once daily for 7 days. Overall treatment success was defined as complete clearance (clinical cure and mycological cure) at 3 weeks post-treatment. Luzu Cream, 1% demonstrated complete clearance in subjects with tinea cruris: 21% versus 4% for placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Luzu may include, bu are not limited to, the following:
application site reactions
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Luzu or interdigital tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis, please visit the Valeant web page.","Mechanism of Action
Luzu (luliconazole) Cream 1% is an antifungal that belongs to the azole class. Although the exact mechanism of action against dermatophytes is unknown, luliconazole appears to inhibit ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol demethylase. Inhibition of this enzymeâ€™s activity by azoles results in decreased amounts of ergosterol, a constituent of fungal cell membranes, and a corresponding accumulation of lanosterol.

Polyps,Dupixent (dupilumab),"General Information
Dupixent (dupilumab) is a fully-human monoclonal antibody which inhibits the overactive signaling of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), two key proteins that contribute to inflammation.
Dupixent is specifically indicated for use with other medicines to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled.
Dupixent is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous administration. The recommended dose of Dupixent for adult patients is 300 mg given every other week.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Dupixent for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis in adults was based on two pivotal trials (the 24-week SINUS-24 and 52-week SINUS-52) that are part of the Phase 3 LIBERTY clinical trial program. These trials evaluated Dupixent 300 mg every two weeks with standard-of-care mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) compared to placebo injection plus MFNS. In these trials, Dupixent significantly improved key disease measures and met all primary and secondary endpoints. At 24 weeks, patients treated with Dupixent achieved statistically significant improvements in all primary and secondary endpoints, including:
Co-primary endpoints:
57% and 51% improvement in their nasal congestion/obstruction severity compared to a 19% and 15% improvement with placebo in SINUS-24 and SINUS-52, respectively (least squares [LS] mean change from baseline of -1.34 and -1.25 for Dupixent compared to -0.45 and -0.38 for placebo; difference between Dupixent and placebo: -0.89 and -0.87).

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Dupixent or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis in adults, please visit https://www.dupixent.com/crswnp","Mechanism of Action
Dupixent (dupilumab) is a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling by speciï¬�cally binding to the IL-4RÎ± subunit shared by the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes. Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor. Multiple cell types that express IL-4RÎ± (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, goblet cells) and inï¬‚ammatory mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines, chemokines) are involved in inï¬‚ammation. Blocking IL-4RÎ± with dupilumab inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine-induced inï¬‚ammatory responses, including the release of proinï¬‚ammatory cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide, and IgE.

Post Menopause,Arimidex (anastrozole),"General Information
Arimidex has been approved as a treatment for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following therapy with tamoxifen.
Clinical Results
The FDA made its decision after evaluating results of clinical studies involving more than 750 subjects. Results from the two studies showed that Arimidex is effective in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.
","Side Effects
Most commonly reported side effects, regardless of causality, included fatigue, nausea, headache, hot flashes, pain and back pain. Arimidex is not associated with significant weight gain reported with progestins.
","Additional Information
Approximately one woman in eight will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 184,300 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996. It is estimated that about 6% of patients with breast cancer in the United States. have advanced breast cancer.","Mechanism of Action
Results from studies suggest that growth of some breast cancer tumors is stimulated by the female hormone estrogen. Arimidex, a nonsteroidal compound, is the first entry in a new class of third-generation selective oral aromatase inhibitors. Inhibition of aromatase reduces the production of estrogen. Thus, Arimidex reduces serum concentration of estrogen, an effect that has been shown to be of benefit in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.

Post-Menopausal Osteoporosis,Alora,"General Information
Alora is an estrogen replacement therapy system approved for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. In 1996, Alora was approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor menopausal symptoms, specifically hot flashes. The Alora patch is thin, flexible and virtually transparent when worn on the skin. The patch can be placed on the abdomen, hip or buttock and is available in four dosage strengths. It is applied twice weekly and is worn continuously for three or four days.
Osteoporosis is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaken and more prone to breakage. Women who undergo menopause at an early age, are thin, smoke or have a family history of osteoporosis are more likely to develop this debilitating disease.
Clinical Results
Approval of Alora is supported by a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 268 postmenopausal women who experienced an average of at least 60 moderate-to-severe hot flashes during the screening period. At weeks four and 12, Alora was seen to be statistically better than placebo at relieving the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms.
Alora was also tested in clinical trials in 355 hysterectomized, non-osteoporotic women to measure the drug's effect on bone mineral density (BMD). Alora was shown to increase lumbar spine BMD statistically better than placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Alora may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Headache
Nausea
Vomiting
Breast tenderness or enlargement
Retention of excess fluid
Vaginal spotting or bleeding
","Additional Information
For additional information on Alora, please visit Alora.","Mechanism of Action
Alora (estradiol) is a transdermal system designed to deliver estradiol, a human estrogen. Estrogens bind to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues and modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogen replacement therapy acts to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.
The skin metabolizes estradiol only to a small extent compared to orally adminstered estradiol, which is rapidly metabolized into estrone, leading to higher circulating levels of estrone than estradiol. Transdermal administration then, produces therapeutic estradiol levels with lower levels of estrone and requires smaller doses.

Post-Menopausal Osteoporosis,Evenity (romosozumab-aqqg),"General Information
Evenity (romosozumab-aqqg) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG2) and inhibits sclerostin, a glycoprotein secreted by osteocytes that has anti-anabolic effects on bone.
Evenity is specifically indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.
Evenity is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous administration.
The anabolic effect of Evenity wanes after 12 monthly doses of therapy. Therefore, the duration of Evenity use should be limited to 12 monthly doses. If osteoporosis therapy remains warranted, continued therapy with an anti-resorptive agent should be considered.
Two separate syringes (and two separate subcutaneous injections) are needed to administer the total dose of 210 mg of Evenity. Inject two 105 mg/1.17 mL prefilled syringes, one after the other. Evenity should be administered by a healthcare provider.
The recommended dose of Evenity is 210 mg administered subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. Administer once every month. The treatment duration for Evenity is 12 monthly doses. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D during treatment with Evenity. If a dose is missed, administer as soon as it can be rescheduled. Thereafter, Evenity can be scheduled every month from the date of the last dose.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Evenity was based on two phase III trial, FRAME and ARCH.
FRAME (Fracture study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 7,180 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The study evaluated the efficacy of Evenity treatment (210 mg administered monthly), compared with placebo, in reducing the incidence of new vertebral fractures through 12 months. The study also evaluated the efficacy of treating with Evenity for 12 months followed by denosumab for 12 months, compared with placebo followed by denosumab, in reducing the incidence of new vertebral fractures through 24 months. Treatment with Evenity resulted in a significant reduction of new vertebral (spine) fracture at 12 months compared to placebo. This significant reduction in fracture risk persisted through the second year in women who received Evenity during the first year and transitioned to denosumab compared to those who transitioned from placebo to denosumab. In addition, Evenity significantly increased bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck compared to placebo at 12 months. Following the transition from Evenity to denosumab at month 12, BMD continued to increase through month 24.
ARCH (Active-controlled fracture study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture) was a randomized, double-blind, alendronate-controlled study of Evenity in 4,093 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and previous fracture history. This event-driven study evaluated 12 months of Evenity treatment (210 mg administered monthly) followed by at least 12 months of alendronate treatment (70 mg), compared with alendronate treatment alone, to assess its efficacy in reducing the risk of clinical fracture (non-vertebral fracture and symptomatic vertebral fracture) through the primary analysis period and the incidence of new vertebral fracture at 24 months. Treatment with Evenity for 12 months followed by 12 months of alendronate significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fracture at 24 months. Evenity followed by alendronate significantly reduced the risk of clinical fracture (defined as a composite of symptomatic vertebral fracture and nonvertebral fracture) after a median follow-up of 33 months. Evenity significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck at 12 months compared to alendronate. Twelve months of treatment with Evenity followed by 12 months of treatment with alendronate significantly increased BMD compared with alendronate alone.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Evenity may include, but are not limited to, the following:
arthralgia
headache
The Evenity drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning: Evenity may increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. Evenity should not be initiated in patients who have had a myocardial infarction or stroke within the preceding year. Consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. If a patient experiences a myocardial infarction or stroke during therapy, Evenity should be discontinued.
","Additional Information

Post-Menopausal Osteoporosis,Evista (raloxifene hydrochloride),"General Information
Evista (raloxifene hydrochloride) is an estrogen agonist/antagonist, referred to as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and belongs to the benzothiophene class of compounds. The biological actions of raloxifene are largely mediated through binding to estrogen receptors. This binding results in activation of estrogenic pathways in some tissues (agonism) and and the blockade of estrogenic pathways in other tissues (antagonism).
Evista is specifically approved for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, the reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and the reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at high risk of invasive breast cancer. Evista is supplied as a 60 mg tablet designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is one 60 mg tablet daily, which may be administered any time of day without regard to meals.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Evista was based on the results of several clinical trials.
Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Effect on Fracture Incidence
This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational trial enrolled 7,705 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. In the subjects with no baseline fractures, the percentage with one or more than one new vertebral fracture after three years was 1.9% in the Evista arm versus 4.3% in the placebo arm. In the subjects with one or more than one baseline fracture, the percentage of those with one or more than one additional fracture after three years was 14.1% in the Evista arm versus 20.2% in the placebo arm. In all randomized subjects the percentage with one or more than one new clinical (painful) vertebral fracture after three years was 1.8% in the Evista arm versus 3.1% in the placebo arm.
Effect on Bone Mineral Density
All women in this study received Evista (60 mg/day) in addition to calcium (500 mg/day) and vitamin D (400 to 600 IU/day). Treatment with Evista increased spine and hip BMD by 2 to 3%. It also decreased the incidence of the first vertebral fracture from 4.3% for placebo to 1.9% for Evista (relative risk reduction = 55%) and subsequent vertebral fractures from 20.2% for placebo to 14.1% for Evista (relative risk reduction = 30%). The increases in BMD for Lumbar Spine were as follows: 2.0 (12 months) 2.6 (24 months) and 2.6 (36 months); and for Femoral Neck were 1.3 (12 months), 1.9 (24 months) and 2.1 (36 months).
Bone Histology
Bone biopsies for qualitative and quantitative histomorphometry were obtained at baseline and after 2 years of treatment. Of 56 evaluable biopsies, there were statistically significant decreases in bone formation rate per tissue volume, consistent with a reduction in bone turnover. Normal bone quality was maintained, including no evidence of osteomalacia, marrow fibrosis, cellular toxicity, or woven bone.
Effect on Endometrium
Endometrial thickness was evaluated annually in a subset of the study population (1781 subjects) for 3 years. Placebo-treated women had a 0.27 mm mean decrease from baseline in endometrial thickness over 3 years, whereas the Evista-treated women had a 0.06 mm mean increase.
Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Three randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind osteoporosis prevention trials were conducted: a North American trial that enrolled 544 women; a European trial that enrolled 601 women; and an international trial that enrolled 619 women who had undergone hysterectomy. All the subjects received placebo or Evista (60 mg/day) both in combination with calcium supplementation (400 to 600 mg/day).
Effect on Bone Mineral Density
When compared to placebo the increases in BMD for each of the three studies were statistically significant at 12 months and were maintained at 24 months (p=0.001). This included BMD increases in total hip, femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter and lumbar spine. Evista also increased BMD compared with placebo in the total body by 1.3% to 2.0% and in Wardâ€™s Triangle (hip) by 3.1% to 4.0%.
Effect on Endometrium
Endometrial thickness was evaluated from 831 women in all dose groups every 6 months for 24 months. Placebo-treated women had a 0.04 mm mean increase from baseline in endometrial thickness over 2 years, whereas the Evista treated women had a 0.09 mm mean increase.
Reduction in Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis
MORE Trial
This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational trial evaluated the effect of Evista (60 mg/day) on the incidence of breast cancer as a secondary safety endpoint. After four years, Evista reduced the incidence of all breast cancers by 62%, compared with placebo (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.22-0.67). Evista also reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 71%, compared with placebo (ARR 3.1 per 1000 women-years); this was primarily due to an 80% reduction in the incidence of ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the Evista group compared with placebo.
CORE Trial
The effect of Evista on the incidence of invasive breast cancer was evaluated for 4 additional years in a follow-up study conducted in a subset of postmenopausal women originally enrolled in the MORE trial. The women were not re-randomized and thus continued on the 60 mg/day Evista therapy. Evista reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 56%, compared with placebo (ARR 3.0 per 1000 women-years); this was primarily due to a 63% reduction in the incidence of ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the Evista group compared with placebo. There was no reduction in the incidence of ER-negative breast cancer. In a subset of postmenopausal women followed for up to 8 years from randomization in MORE to the end of CORE, Evista (60 mg/day) reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 60% in women assigned Evista compared with placebo (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21, 0.77; ARR 1.95 per 1000 women-years); this was primarily due to a 65% reduction in the incidence of ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the Evista group compared with placebo.
RUTH Trial
This randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, multinational study enrolled 10,101 postmenopausal women at increased risk of coronary events. The women were followed for a median of 5.6 years after treatment. Evista (60 mg/day) reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 44% compared with placebo [absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2 per 1000 women-years]; this was primarily due to a 55% reduction in ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the Evista group compared with placebo (ARR 1.2 per 1000 women-years). There was no reduction in ER-negative invasive breast cancer.
Reduction in Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women at High Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer
STAR Trial
This randomized, double-blind trial enrolled 19,747 postmenopausal women in North America. The trial was designed to compare the effects of Evista (60 mg/day) versus tamoxifen (20 mg/day) over 5 years on reducing the incidence of invasive breast cancer. Evista was not superior to tamoxifen in reducing the incidence of invasive breast cancer. The observed incidence rates of invasive breast cancer were Evista 4.4 and tamoxifen 4.3 per 1000 women per year.
Effects on Cardiovascular Disease
In the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational trial, dubbed RUTH, 10,101 postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events, received Evista 60 mg/day. They were observed for a median follow-up of 5.6 years. No cardiovascular benefit was demonstrated after treatment with Evista and no significant increase or decrease was observed for coronary events. An increased risk of death due to stroke after treatment with Evista was observed: 59 (1.2%) Evista-treated women died due to a stroke compared to 39 (0.8%) placebo-treated women (2.2 versus 1.5 per 1000 women-years; hazard ratio 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.24; p=0.0499).

The biological actions of raloxifene are largely mediated through binding to estrogen receptors. This binding results in activation of estrogenic pathways in some tissues (agonism) and and the blockade of estrogenic pathways in other tissues (antagonism). The agonistic or antagonistic activity of raloxiffene depends on the extent of recruitment of coactivators and corepressors to estrogen receptor (ER) target gene promotors. Raloxifene appears to act as an estrogen agonist in bone. It decreases bone resorption and bone turnover, increases bone mineral density and decreases fracture incidence.

Evidence of efficacy is based on increases in spinal bone mineral density observed in 551 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who were studied for up to two years.
","Side Effects
Nasal irritation and other symptoms of the nose such as dryness, redness, itching, or bleeding were the most commonly reported side effects.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Miacalcin nasal spray, like natural calcitonin, acts primarily by inhibiting osteoclasts, the cells that break down existing bone, thereby decreasing the rate of bone breakdown, allowing the body to build bone naturally."
Post-Menopausal Osteoporosis,Premarin (conjugated estrogens),"General Information
Premarin for oral administration contains a mixture of conjugated estrogens obtained exclusively from natural sources.
Premarin is specifically indicated for the following:
1.Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause
2.Treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause.

5. For treatment of advanced androgen-dependent carcinoma of the prostate, for palliation only: 1.25 mg to 2 x 1.25 mg three times daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Premarin was based on the following studies:
Vasomotor symptoms
Data are from 2,805 postmenopausal women enrolled in the HOPE Study. The women were randomly assigned to one of eight treatment groups, receiving either placebo or conjugated estrogens, with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate. Efficacy for vasomotor symptoms was assessed during the first 12 weeks of treatment in a subset of symptomatic women (n = 241) who had at least seven moderate to severe hot flushes daily, or at least 50 moderate to severe hot flushes during the week before randomization. Premarin (0.3 mg, 0.45 mg, and 0.625 mg tablets) was shown to be statistically better than placebo at weeks 4 and 12 for relief of both the frequency and severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.
Effects on vulvar and vaginal atrophy
Results of vaginal maturation indexes at cycles 6 and 13 showed that the differences from placebo were statistically significant (p < 0.001) for all treatment groups (conjugated estrogens alone and conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment groups).
Effects on bone mineral density
Data is from the double-blind, randomized, placebo/active-drug-controlled, multicenter HOPE study. The study enrolled healthy postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, who were 2.3 Â± 0.9 years on average since menopause and took one 600-mg tablet of elemental calcium (Caltrate) daily. The subjects were treated with Premarin 0.625 mg, 0.45 mg, 0.3 mg, or placebo. Prevention of bone loss was assessed by measurement of bone mineral density (BMD), primarily at the anteroposterior lumbar spine (L2 to L4). Secondarily, BMD measurements of the total body, femoral neck, and trochanter were also analyzed. All active treatment groups showed significant differences from placebo in each of the four BMD endpoints at cycles 6, 13, 19, and 26. The mean percent increases in the primary efficacy measure (L2 to L4 BMD) at the final on-therapy evaluation (cycle 26 for those who completed and the last available evaluation for those who discontinued early) were 2.46% with 0.625 mg, 2.26% with 0.45 mg, and 1.13% with 0.3 mg. The placebo group showed a mean percent decrease from baseline at the final evaluation of 2.45%. These results supported the efficacy of the lower doses.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Premarin may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Headache Infection
Pain
Abdominal pain
Back pain
Arthralgia
Vaginal hemorrhage
Upper respiratory infection
","Additional Information

Premarin for oral administration contains a mixture of conjugated estrogens obtained exclusively from natural sources, occurring as the sodium salts of water-soluble estrogen sulfates blended to represent the average composition of material derived from pregnant mares' urine. It is a mixture of sodium estrone sulfate and sodium equilin sulfate.
"
Post-Menopausal Osteoporosis,Prempro & Premphase (conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets),"General Information
Prempro/Premphase is an estrogen plus progestin hormone replacement therapy.
Prempro/Premphase is specifically indicated for:
the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause
the treatment of moderate to severe vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause
the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis
The recommended dose is as follows:
Prempro: one tablet containing conjugated estrogens (CE) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) taken orally once daily. Premphase: one maroon tablet containing 0.625 mg CE taken orally on days 1 through 14, and one light-blue tablet containing 0.625 mg CE plus 5.0 mg MPA taken orally on days 15 through 28.
Clinical Results
Most studies have not shown a higher risk of breast cancer in women who have used estrogens. Some studies have reported that breast cancer developed more often in women who used estrogens for long periods of time or who used high doses for shorter time periods. The effects of added progestins on the risk of breast cancer are unknown. Some studies have reported a moderately increased risk in those taking combination estrogen/progestin therapy, even higher than the possible risk of taking estrogens alone. Other studies have not shown this relationship. The addition of progestin may have unfavorable effects on blood sugars and fats, which might make a diabetic condition worse.
","Side Effects
The most commonly reported side effects in the clinical study were breast tenderness, headache, and abdominal pain. Rarely, however, were these serious enough to cause women to stop therapy.
","Additional Information
Previously, physicians have prescribed estrogen and progestin for nonhysterectomized women needing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in a variety of different regimens. Until now, a woman taking estrogen and progestin at different times throughout the month had to keep track of where she was in her cycle and whether she needed to take one tablet (estrogen alone), or two tablets (estrogen and progestin) on any given day. As a result, many women found their HRT regimens difficult to follow.
Some women should not take HRT. A woman should make sure her doctor or health care provider is aware of her personal or family health history before taking HRT. This history should include instances of breast cancer, breast lumps, abnormal vaginal bleeding, abnormal blood clotting, severe headache, dizziness, and liver disease. Women who are pregnant should not take HRT. Estrogens have been reported to increase the risk of cancer of the uterus in postmenopausal women.",
Post-Menopausal Osteoporosis,Prolia (denosumab),"General Information
Prolia (denosumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to and inhibits the receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANK Ligand), the primary mediator of bone resorption. RANK Ligand is the protein responsible for activating osteoclasts, the cells that break down bone. An increased amount of the protein has been linked as the primary cause of a broad range of bone loss conditions including osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, bone erosions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and bone metastases.
Prolia is specifically indicated for the following patients at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture:
â€¢ Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.
â€¢ To increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.
â€¢ Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women at high risk of fracture who are either initiating or continuing systemic glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5mg or greater of prednisone and expected to remain on glucocorticoids for at least 6months.
â€¢ To increase bone mass in men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer.
â€¢ To increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer.
Prolia is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous administration. The recommended initial dose is 60 mg administered as a single subcutaneous injection once every 6 months. Prolia should be administered via subcutaneous injection in the upper arm, the upper thigh, or the abdomen.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Prolia for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was based on a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial enrolled 7,808 women aged 60 to 91 years with a baseline BMD T-score between -2.5 and -4.0 at either the lumbar spine or total hip. Women with other diseases or on therapy that affect bone were excluded. The women were randomized to receive SC injections of either placebo or Prolia 60 mg once every 6 months. All women received at least 1000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of new morphometric (radiologically-diagnosed) vertebral fractures at 3 years. Prolia significantly reduced the incidence of new morphometric vertebral fractures at 1, 2, and 3 years. The incidence of new vertebral fractures at year 3 was 7.2% in the placebo-treated women compared to 2.3% for the Prolia-treated women.
The FDA approval of Prolia to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis was based on a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled men (n=242) had a baseline BMD T-score between -2.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck. Men with a BMD T-score between -1.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck were also enrolled if there was a history of prior fragility fracture. The subjects were randomized to receive SC injections of either placebo (n=121) or Prolia 60mg (n =121) once every 6 months. All men received at least 1000mg calcium and at least 800IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine Bone Mineral Density (BMD) from baseline to 1-year. The treatment differences in BMD at 1-year were 4.8% (+0.9% placebo, +5.7% Prolia; at the lumbar spine, 2.0% (+0.3% placebo, +2.4% Prolia) at the total hip, and 2.2% (0.0% placebo, +2.1% Prolia) at femoral neck.
The FDA approval of Prolia in the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was based on the 12-month primary analysis of a 2-year, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled study of 795 patients (70% women and 30% men) aged 20 to 94 years (mean age of 63 years) treated with greater than or equal to 7.5mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent) for < 3 months prior to study enrollment and planning to continue treatment for a total of at least 6 months (glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation; n = 290) or â‰¥ 3 months prior to study enrollment and planning to continue treatment for a total of at least 6 months (glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation, n = 505). Enrolled patients <50 years of age were required to have a history of osteoporotic fracture. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either an oral daily bisphosphonate (active-control, risedronate 5mg once daily) (n = 397) or Prolia 60mg subcutaneously once every 6 months (n = 398) for one year. Patients received at least 1000mg calcium and 800IU vitamin D supplementation daily. In the glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation, Prolia significantly increased lumbar spine BMD compared to the active-control at one year (Active-control 0.8%, Prolia 3.8%) with a treatment difference of 2.9%. In the glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation, Prolia significantly increased lumbar spine BMD compared to active-control at one year (Active-control 2.3%, Prolia 4.4%) with a treatment difference of 2.2%.
The FDA approval of Prolia in the treatment of bone loss in men with non-metastatic prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was based on a 3-year, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national study conducted in 1,468 men. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -0.4, and 22% of men had a vertebral fracture at baseline. Men were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (n=734) or Prolia 60mg (n=734) once every 6 months for a total of 6 doses. Randomization was stratified by age (<70 years vs. â‰¥70 years) and duration of ADT at trial entry (â‰¤6 months vs. >6 months). Seventy-nine percent of patients received ADT for more than 6months at study entry. All men received at least 1000mg calcium and 400IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to month 24. Lumbar spine BMD was higher at 2 years in Prolia-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients [-1.0% placebo, +5.6% Prolia; treatment difference 6.7%].
The FDA approval of Prolia for the treatment of bone loss in women receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy for breast cancer was based on a 2-year, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study. Women (n=252) had baseline BMD T-scores between -1.0 to-2.5 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck, and had not experienced fracture after age 25. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -1.1,and 2.0% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline. Women were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (n=125) or Prolia 60mg (n=127) once every 6 months for a total of 4 doses. Randomization was stratified by duration of adjuvant AI therapy at trial entry (â‰¤6months vs. >6months). Sixty-two percent of patients received adjuvant AI therapy for more than 6 months at study entry. All women received at least 1000mg calcium and 400IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to month 12. Lumbar spine BMD was higher at 12 months in Prolia-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients [-0.7% placebo, +4.8% Prolia; treatment difference 5.5%].

Prolia (denosumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to RANKL, a transmembrane or soluble protein essential for the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. Prolia prevents RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone.

Post-Menopausal Osteoporosis,Reclast (zoledronic acid),"General Information
Reclast (zoledronic acid) is is a bisphosphonic acid inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption. Once administered, it rapidly moves to bone and preferentially localizes at sites of high bone turnover.
Reclast is specifically indicated for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.
Reclast is supplied as 5 mg in a 100 mL ready to infuse solution for intravenous administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is a 5 mg infusion once a year given intravenously over no less than 15 minutes.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Reclast was based on the results of a clinical trial. This randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, multinational study enrolled 7,736 women aged 65-89 years with osteoporosis. The subjects were stratified into two groups Stratum I: no concomitant use of osteoporosis therapy or Stratum II: baseline concomitant use of osteoporosis therapies which included calcitonin, raloxifene, tamoxifen and hormone replacement therapy. Reclast was administered once a year for three consecutive years, as a single 5 mg dose in 100 mL solution infused over at least 15 minutes, for a total of three doses. All subjects received 1000 to 1500 mg of elemental calcium plus 400 to 1200 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. The subjects in Stratum I were evaluated annually for incidence of vertebral fractures. The subjects in Stratum I and II were evaluated for the incidence of hip and other clinical fractures. The primary endpoints were the incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures at 3 years and the incidence of hip fractures over a median duration of 3 years.
Effect on vertebral fractures over three years
Reclast significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures over three years compared to placebo. In the Reclast arm, there was a 3.3% rate of at least one new vertebral fracture versus 10.9% in the placebo arm (p <0.0001) for a 7.6% absolute reduction in fracture incidence and 70% reduction in fracture incidence.
Effect on hip fracture over three years
Reclast demonstrated a 1.1% absolute reduction and 41% relative reduction in the risk of hip fractures over a median duration of 3 years. The hip fracture event rate was 1.4% for Reclast -treated subjects compared to 2.5% for placebo -treated subjects.
Reclast also had a positive effect over placebo in the following areas:
Bone Mineral Density
Reclast significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck, relative to treatment with placebo at time points 12, 24, and 36 months. Treatment with Reclast resulted in a 6.7% increase in BMD at the lumbar spine, 6.0 % at the total hip, and 5.1% at the femoral neck, over 3 years as compared to placebo.
Bone Histology
Bone biopsy specimens were obtained between months 33 and 36 from 82 subjects treated with 3 annual doses of Reclast. Qualitative, quantitative and micro CT assessments showed bone of normal architecture and quality without mineralization defects.
Effect on Height
Over the three-year study standing height was measured annually using a stadiometer. The Reclast group revealed less height loss compared to placebo (4.2 mm vs. 7.0 mm, respectively (p<0.001)).
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Reclast may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Post-Menopausal Osteoporosis,Tymlos (abaloparatide),"General Information
Tymlos (abaloparatide) is a human parathyroid hormone related peptide [PTHrP(1-34)] analog.
Tymlos is specifically indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.
Tymlos is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous injection. The recommended dosage of Tymlos is 80 mcg subcutaneously once daily. Cumulative use of Tymlos and parathyroid hormone analogs (e.g., teriparatide) for more than 2 years during a patientâ€™s lifetime is not recommended. Patients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approved Tymlos was based on the results at 18 months from the landmark ACTIVE trial and first six months of ACTIVExtend trial. Subjects were randomized to receive Tymlos 80 mcg (N = 824) or placebo (N = 821) given subcutaneously once daily. Data demonstrated consistent significant and rapid reductions in the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures regardless of age, years since menopause, presence or absence of prior fracture (vertebral or nonvertebral) and bone mineral density (BMD) at baseline. Specifically, in the ACTIVE trial, Tymlos demonstrated significant reductions in the relative risk of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures compared to placebo: 86% in new vertebral fractures and 43% in nonvertebral fractures. The absolute risk reductions were 3.6% and 2.0%, respectively.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Tymlos may include, but are not limited to, the following:
hypercalciuria

The Tymlos label comes with the following Black Box Warning:
Abaloparatide caused a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma, a malignant bone tumor, in male and female rats. It is unknown whether Tymlos will cause osteosarcoma in humans. Use of Tymlos is not recommended in patients at increased risk for osteosarcoma. Cumulative use of Tymlos and parathyroid hormone analogs (e.g., teriparatide) for more than 2 years during a patientâ€™s lifetime is not recommended.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Tymlos or postmenopausal osteoporosis, please visit http://tymlos.com/","Mechanism of Action
Tymlos (abaloparatide) is a human parathyroid hormone related peptide [PTHrP(1-34)] analog, which acts as an agonist at the PTH1 receptor (PTH1R). This results in activation of the cAMP signaling pathway in target cells. In rats and monkeys, abaloparatide had an anabolic effect on bone, demonstrated by increases in BMD and bone mineral content (BMC) that correlated with increases in bone strength at vertebral and/or nonvertebral site.

Post-Partum Depression,Zulresso (brexanolone),"General Information
Zulresso (brexanolone) is a neuroactive steroid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor positive modulator.
Zulresso is specifically indicated for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) in adults.
Zulresso is supplied as a solution for intravenous administration. Administer Zulresso as a continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over a total of 60 hours (2.5 days) as follows:
â€¢ 0 to 4 hours: Initiate with a dosage of 30 mcg/kg/hour
â€¢ 4 to 24 hours: Increase dosage to 60 mcg/kg/hour
â€¢ 24 to 52 hours: Increase dosage to 90 mcg/kg/hour (a reduction in dosage to 60 mcg/kg/hour may be considered during this time period for patients who do not tolerate 90 mcg/kg/hour)
â€¢ 52 to 56 hours: Decrease dosage to 60 mcg/kg/hour
â€¢ 56 to 60 hours: Decrease dosage to 30 mcg/kg/hour
If excessive sedation occurs at any time during the infusion, stop the infusion until the symptoms resolve. The infusion may be resumed at the same or lower dose as clinically appropriate.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The efficacy of Zulresso in the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) was demonstrated in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (referred to as Studies 1 and 2) in women (18 to 45 years) with PPD who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for a major depressive episode (DSM-IV) with onset of symptoms in the third trimester or within 4 weeks of delivery. In these studies, patients received a 60-hour continuous intravenous infusion of Zulresso or placebo and were then followed for 4 weeks. Study 1 included patients with severe PPD (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score â‰¥ 26), and Study 2 included patients with moderate PPD (HAM-D score of 20 to 25). A titration to the recommended target dosage of 90 mcg/kg/hour was evaluated in both studies (patients received 30 mcg/kg/hour for 4 hours, 60 mcg/kg/hour for 20 hours, 90 mcg/kg/hour for 28 hours, followed by a taper to 60 mcg/kg/hour for 4 hours and then 30 mcg/kg/hour for 4 hours). A titration to a target dosage of 60 mcg/kg/hour (patients received 30 mcg/kg/hour for 4 hours, 60 mcg/kg/hour for 52 hours, then 30 mcg/kg/hour for 4 hours) was also evaluated in Study 1. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in depressive symptoms as measured by the HAM-D total score at the end of the infusion (Hour 60). In both placebo-controlled studies, titration to a target dose of Zulresso 90 mcg/kg/hour was superior to placebo in improvement of depressive symptoms. In a group of 38 patients in Study 1, a Zulresso titration to a target dose of 60 mcg/kg/hour was also superior to placebo in improvement of depressive symptoms.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Zulresso may include, but are not limited to, the following:
sedation/somnolence
dry mouth
loss of consciousness
flushing/hot flush
The Zulresso drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning: Patients are at risk of excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness during administration of Zulreso â€¢ Because of the risk of serious harm, patients must be monitored for excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness and have continuous pulse oximetry monitoring. Patients must be accompanied during interactions with their child(ren). â€¢ Zulresso is available only through a restricted program called the Zulresso REMS.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Zulresso or post-partum depression please visit https://www.sagerx.com/","Mechanism of Action
Zulresso (brexanolone) is an allosteric modulator of both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. Allosteric modulation of neurotransmitter receptor activity results in varying degrees of desired activity rather than complete activation or inhibition of the receptor. The mechanism of action of brexanolone in the treatment of PPD in adults is not fully understood, but is thought to be related to its positive allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors.

Post-Surgical Pain,Exparel (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension),,,,
Posterior Uveitis,Humira (adalimumab),"General Information
Humira (adalimumab) is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker.
Humira is specifically indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis.
Humira is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous use. The recommended dose is 80 mg initial dose, followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after initial dose.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Humira for non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis was based on two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or Humira at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was time to treatment failure. Study UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15. Study UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19. Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in patients treated with Humira versus patients receiving placebo,(percentage in failure).

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Diclegis was based on a double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study in adult women in 7 to 14 weeks gestation (median 9 weeks of gestation) with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. The subjects were adminitered two tablets of Diclegis or placebo at bedtime on Day 1. If symptoms of nausea and vomiting persisted into the afternoon hours of Day 2, they were directed to take the usual dose of two tablets at bedtime that night and, beginning on Day 3, to take one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime. Based upon assessment of remaining symptoms at the clinic visit on Day 4, the subject may have been directed to take an additional tablet mid-afternoon. A maximum of four tablets (one in the morning, one in the mid-afternoon and two at bedtime) were taken daily. Over the treatment period, 19% of Diclegis-treated subjects remained on 2 tablets daily, 21% received 3 tablets daily, and 60% received 4 tablets daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Day 15 in the Pregnancy Unique-Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score. This score incorporates the number of daily vomiting episodes, number of daily heaves, and length of daily nausea in hours, for an overall score of symptoms rated from 3 (no symptoms) to 15 (most severe). At baseline, the mean PUQE score was 9.0 in the Diclegis arm and 8.8 in the placebo arm.

Makena is supplied as a solution for intramuscular injection. Makena should be aministered intramuscularly at a dose of 250 mg (1 mL) once weekly (every 7 days). Treatment should begin between 16 weeks, 0 days and 20 weeks, 6 days of gestation. Administration should be continued once weekly until week 37 (through 36 weeks, 6 days) of gestation or delivery, whichever occurs first.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Makena was based on a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle (placebo)-controlled clinical trial. The trial enrolled 463 women with a singleton pregnancy (age 16 to 43 years) who had a documented history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth (defined as delivery at less than 37 weeks of gestation following spontaneous preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes). The women were randomized to receive either Makena or vehicle at a dose of 250 mg administered weekly by intramuscular injection starting between 16 weeks, 0 days and 20 weeks, 6 days of gestation, and continuing until 37 weeks of gestation or delivery. Compared to controls, treatment with Makena reduced the proportion of women who delivered preterm at < 37 weeks. The proportions of women delivering at < 35 and < 32 weeks also were lower among women treated with Makena. The upper bounds of the confidence intervals for the treatment difference at < 35 and < 32 weeks were close to zero. After adjusting for time in the study, 7.5% of Makena-treated subjects delivered prior to 25 weeks compared to 4.7% of control subjects. A composite neonatal morbidity/mortality index evaluated adverse outcomes in livebirths. It was based on the number of neonates who died or experienced respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, proven sepsis, or necrotizing enterocolitis. Although the proportion of neonates who experienced 1 or more events was numerically lower in the Makena arm (11.9% vs. 17.2%), the number of adverse outcomes was limited and the difference between arms was not statistically significant.

â€¢ Adagen-naÃ¯ve patients: The starting dose of Revcovi is 0.4 mg/kg weekly based on ideal body weight, divided into two doses (0.2 mg/kg twice a week).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Revcovi was based on a Phase 3, open-label, multicenter, single-arm, one-way crossover study in 6 patients with ADA-SCID, 8 to 24 years of age, who were receiving therapy with Adagen. The study treatment consisted of three phases: Adagen Lead-in Phase (minimum of 3 weeks), the Revcovi Treatment Phase (weeks 1 through 21), and followed by the Revcovi Maintenance Phase. The starting weekly dose of Revcovi was calculated based on the last Adagen dose received in the study. Weekly Revcovi doses ranged from 0.188 mg/kg to 0.292 mg/k. Efficacy was assessed by 1) Trough dAXP level, 2) Trough plasma ADA activity and 3) Immune status (lymphocyte and B-, T-, and NK-lymphocyte subset counts as well as quantitative immunoglobulin [Ig] concentration [IgG, IgA, IgM]). The data showed treatment with Revcovi increased ADA activity, decreased concentrations of toxic metabolites, and improved total lymphocyte counts.

Contrave is specifically indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of: 30 kg/m2 or greater (obese) or 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbidity.
Contrave is supplied as an extended release table for oral administration. Dosing should be escalated according to the following schedule:
Week 1: Morning dose: 1 tablet Evening dose: no tablet
Week 2: Morning dose: 1 tablet Evening dose: 1 tablet
Week 3: Morning dose: 2 tablets Evening dose: 1 tablet
Week 4 - Onward: Morning dose: 2 tablets Evening dose: 2 tablets
Patients using Contrave at the maintenance dose should be evaluated after 12 weeks to determine if the treatment is working. If a patient has not lost at least 5 percent of baseline body weight, Contrave should be discontinued.
Contrave has the potential to cause suicidal thoughts and behaviors and neuropsychiatric reactions.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Contrave was based on multiple clinical trials that included approximately 4,500 obese and overweight patients with and without significant weight-related conditions treated for one year. All patients received lifestyle modification that consisted of a reduced- calorie diet and regular physical activity.
Results from a clinical trial that enrolled patients without diabetes showed that patients had an average weight loss of 4.1% over treatment with placebo (inactive pill) at one year. In this trial, 42% f patients treated with Contrave lost at least 5 percent of their body weight compared with 17% of patients treated with placebo. Results from another clinical trial that enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes showed that patients had an average weight loss of 2% over treatment with placebo at one year. In this trial, 36% of patients treated with Contrave lost at least 5 percent of their body weight compared with 18% of patients treated with placebo.

Contrave is combination of naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, and bupropion, an inhibitor of the neuronal reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. Nonclinical studies suggest that naltrexone and bupropion have effects on two separate areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake: the hypothalamus (appetite regulatory center) and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit (reward system). The exact neurochemical effects of Contrave leading to weight loss are not fully understood.

Obesity,MERIDIA,"General Information
In October of 2010 the FDA requested that Abbott Laboratoriesâ€”the manufacturer of Meridiaâ€”voluntarily withdraw this drug product from the United States market due to cardiovascular risks. Abbott agreed to voluntarily stop marketing of Meridia in the United States.
MERIDIA (sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate) has been approved for the management of obesity, including weight loss and maintenance of weight loss, when used in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet.
","Side Effects
Most side effects associated with MERIDIA are mild and transient in nature, including dry mouth, headache, constipation, and insomnia.
",,"Mechanism of Action
MERIDIA works in a different manner than other prescription weight management medications. It is a neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor that merely enhances the body's normal function. MERIDIA is not a releasing agent. It does not get inside the cells to boost the release of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin. Instead, as a reuptake inhibitor, MERIDIA works outside the cells to stop neurotransmitters from being reabsorbed. MERIDIA works by affecting natural chemicals in the brain involved in regulating appetite--allowing them to act longer. The appetite control center in the brain is believed to regulate the amount of food eaten through feelings of hunger and fullness."
Obesity,Qsymia (phentermine + topiramate extended-release),"General Information
Qsymia is a combination of phentermine, a sympathomimetic amine anorectic, and topiramate extended-release, an antiepileptic drug.
Qsymia is specifically indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obese), or 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight related comorbidity such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia.
Qsymia is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. Qsymia should be administered once daily in the morning with or without food. Avoid dosing with Qsymia in the evening due to the possibility of insomnia. The recommended dose is as follows: Start treatment with Qsymia 3.75 mg/23 mg (phentermine/topiramate extended-release) daily for 14 days; after 14 days increase to the recommended dose of Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg once daily. Evaluate weight loss after 12 weeks of treatment with Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg. If at least 3% of baseline body weight has not been lost on Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg, discontinue Qsymia or escalate the dose. To escalate the dose: Increase to Qsymia 11.25 mg/69 mg daily for 14 days; followed by dosing Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg daily. Evaluate weight loss following dose escalation to Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg after an additional 12 weeks of treatment. If at least 5% of baseline body weight has not been lost on Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg, discontinue Qsymia as directed.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Qsymia was based on two randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies in obese patients (Study 1) and in obese and overweight patients with two or more significant co-morbidities (Study 2). Both studies had a four-week titration period, followed by 52 weeks of treatment. Two co-primary efficacy outcomes were measured after 1 year of treatment (Week 56): 1) the percent weight loss from baseline; and 2) treatment response defined as achieving at least 5% weight loss from baseline. During the studies, a well-balanced, reduced-calorie diet to result in an approximate 500 kcal/day decrease in caloric intake was recommended and subjects were offered nutritional and lifestyle modification counseling.
Study One
Obese subjects (BMI greater than or equal to 35 kg/m2) were randomized to receive 1 year of treatment with placebo (N=514), Qsymia 3.75 mg/23 mg (N=241), or Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg (N=512). At the beginning of the study the average weight and BMI was 116 kg and 42 kg/m2, respectively. In this study 40% of randomized subjects withdrew prior to week 56. After 1 year of treatment with Qsymia, all dose levels resulted in statistically significant weight loss compared to placebo. A statistically significant greater proportion of the subjects randomized to Qsymia than placebo achieved 5% and 10% weight loss: 17%, 45% and 67% and 7%, 19% and 47% in the placebo, Qsymia 3.75 mg/23 mg and Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg arms, respectively.
Study Two
Overweight and obese subjects were randomized to receive 1 year of treatment with placebo (N=994), Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg (N=498), or Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg (N=995). Eligible subjects had to have a BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2 and less than or equal to45 kg/m2 (no lower limit on BMI for patients with type 2 diabetes) and two or more of the following obesity-related co-morbid conditions: elevated blood pressure, triglycerides greater than 200-400 mg/dL, elevated fasting blood glucose or diabetes and waist circumference greater than or equal to 102 cm for men or greater than or equal to 88 cm for women. The average weight and BMI at the start of the study was 103 kg and 36.6 kg/m2, respectively. In this study 31% of randomized subjects withdrew prior to week 56. After 1 year of treatment with Qsymia, all dose levels resulted in statistically significant weight loss compared to placebo. A statistically significant greater proportion of the subjects randomized to Qsymia than placebo achieved 5% and 10% weight loss: 21%, 62% and 70% and 7%, 37% and 48% in the placebo, Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg and Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg treatment arms, respectively.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Qsymia may include, but are not limited to, the following:
paraesthesia
dizziness
dysgeusia
insomnia
constipation
dry mouth
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Qsymia or chronic weight management, please visit the Qsymia web page.","Mechanism of Action
Qsymia is a combination of phentermine, a sympathomimetic amine anorectic, and topiramate extended-release, an antiepileptic drug. Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine. The effect of phentermine on chronic weight management is likely mediated by release of catecholamines in the hypothalamus, resulting in reduced appetite and decreased food consumption, but other metabolic effects may also be involved. The exact mechanism of action is not known. The precise mechanism of action of topiramate on chronic weight management is not known. Topiramateâ€™s effect on chronic weight management may be due to its effects on both appetite suppression and satiety enhancement, induced by a combination of pharmacologic effects including augmenting the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyrate, modulation of voltage-gated ion channels, inhibition of AMPA/kainite excitatory glutamate receptors, or inhibition of carbonic anhydrase.

Obesity,Redux (dexfenfluramine hydrochloride),"General Information
Redux, when combined with a reduced-calorie diet, has been indicated for the management of obesity, including weight loss and maintenance of that weight loss. The safety and effectiveness of Redux beyond one year have not been determined at this time.
Redux is recommended for obese subjects with an initial body mass index (BMI) of at least 30 kg/m2 (which is approximately 30% over desirable weight) or a BMI of at least 27 kg/m2 (which is approximately 20% over desirable weight) in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia). Redux is available by physician's prescription in 15 mg capsules to be taken twice daily.
Clinical Results
In clinical trials, Redux therapy was associated with decreased appetite and may make people feel full and lessen their desire to eat.
In a large, one-year clinical trial of more than 900 subjects, individuals taking Redux in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet loss significantly more weight than subjects on diet and placebo. Redux helped produce a significant reduction in weight during the first four to six months. This response was maintained during a year of therapy. At the end of the year, 64% of all subjects lost at least 5% of their initial total weight, 40% lost at least 10%, and 21% lost at least 15%. In a study of 60 obese subjects who had successfully lost weight by dieting alone (i.e., lost at least ten pounds in the previous year), the addition of Redux to their regimen resulted in the further loss of 26% of initial excess weight.
","Side Effects
The most commonly reported side effects in clinical trials included drowsiness, diarrhea, and dry mouth. These side effects were usually mild and disappeared in a few weeks.
There is a low incidence of a serious, potentially life-threatening cardiovascular condition, primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), associated with the use of all types of prescription weight loss drugs (anorexigens). A two-year study looked to investigate all incidences of PPH in Europe and identified 95 cases: 20 of these had been exposed to anorexigens in the past. Eighteen of the 20 cases identified a history of dexfenfluramine use. In an initial review of these cases (excluding ten additional cases where the specific drug or dates of use were unknown), the use of anorexigens for longer than three months was associated with a nine-fold increase in the risk of PPH. Therefore, the risk of PPH in obese subjects was estimated to be at least 18 cases per 1,000,000 subjects per year. The authors of the initial review are continuing to analyze the data. In the general population, the yearly occurrence of PPH is one to two cases per one million people.
Redux should not be used in subjects hypersensitive to dexfenfluramine or related compounds, in subjects with diagnosed pulmonary hypertension, or in subjects taking (or without 14 days of discontinuing) monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Redux should not be administered to patients using other serotoninergic drugs. Redux is not recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing or for pediatric subjects.
",,"Mechanism of Action
The mechanism of action of Redux is based upon its effects on serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain. Redux works primarily by decreased caloric intake associated with increased activity of serotonin in the brain."
Obesity,Saxenda (liraglutide [rDNA origin] injection),"General Information
Saxenda (liraglutide [rDNA origin] injection) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and calorie intake, and the GLP-1 receptor is present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation.
Saxenda is specifically indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obese), or 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition (e.g.,hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia).
Saxenda is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous administration. The recommended dose of Saxenda is 3 mg daily. Administer at any time of day, without regard to the timing of meals. Dosing should be initiated at 0.6 mg per day for one week. Increase the dose in weekly intervals until a dose of 3 mg is reached. Saxenda should be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. The injection site and timing can be changed without dose adjustment.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Saxenda for chronic weight management was based on three 56-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In all studies, Saxenda was titrated to 3 mg daily during a 4-week period. All patients received instruction for a reduced calorie diet (approximately 500 kcal/day deficit) and exercise counseling (recommended increase in physical activity of minimum 150 mins/week) that began with the first dose of study medication or placebo and continued throughout the trial. Study 1 was a 56-week trial that enrolled 3,731 patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2) or with overweight (BMI 27-29.9 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition such as treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. Study 2 was a 56-week trial that enrolled 635 patients with type 2 diabetes and with either overweight or obesity (as defined above). Patients were to have an HbA1c of 7-10% and be treated with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or a glitazone as single agent or in any combination, or with diet and exercise alone. Study 3 was a 56-week trial that enrolled 422 patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2) or with overweight (BMI 27-29.9 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition such as treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. All patients were first treated with a low-calorie diet (total energy intake 1200-1400 kcal/day) in a run-in period lasting up to 12 weeks. Patients who lost at least 5% of their screening body weight after 4 to 12 weeks during the run-in were then randomized, with equal allocation, to receive either Saxenda or placebo for 56 weeks. The subjects in Studies ! and 2 also received either Saxenda or placebo for 56 weeks. The proportions of patients who discontinued study drug in the 56-week trials were 27% for the Saxenda-treated group and 35% for the placebo-treated group. Approximately 10% of patients treated with Saxenda and 4% of patients treated with placebo discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction.
Study Results:
For Study 1 and Study 2, the primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in body weight and the percentages of patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% and 10% weight loss from baseline to week 56. For Study 3, the primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in body weight from randomization to week 56, the percentage of patients not gaining more than 0.5% body weight from randomization to week 56, and the percentage of patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% weight loss from randomization to week 56. After 56 weeks, treatment with Saxenda resulted in a statistically significant reduction in weight compared with placebo. Statistically significantly greater proportions of patients treated with Saxenda achieved 5% and 10% weight loss than those treated with placebo. In Study 3, statistically significantly more patients randomized to Saxenda than placebo had not gained more than 0.5% of body weight from randomization to week 56.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Saxenda may include, but are not limited to, the following:
nausea
hypoglycemia
diarrhea
constipation
vomiting
headache
decreased appetite

Liraglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice. It is unknown whether Saxenda causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Saxenda is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,LUVOX (fluvoxamine maleate),"General Information
LUVOX (fluvoxamine maleate) has been approved for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adolescents.
Clinical Results
A 10-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study of LUVOX Tablets involving 120 children ranging in age from 8 to 17 years showed that fluvoxamine is more effective than placebo for the treatment of OCD. LUVOX Tablets was also well-tolerated; only three children taking fluvoxamine dropped out of the study due to adverse effects, none of which were considered serious.
","Side Effects
Most commonly observed side effects included agitation, hyperkinesia, depression, dysmenorrhea, flatulence and rash.
","Additional Information
OCD can strike in children as young as three or four, but is often undetected at this early age. Although children and adults experience many of the same obsessions (fear of contamination, need for symmetry, excessive doubt) and compulsions (excessive cleaning/washing, arranging/organizing, checking/questioning), children and adolescents with OCD are more likely to involve family members in their rituals. For example, they may insist their laundry be washed several times, demand that parents check their homework repeatedly, or become upset if siblings ""contaminate"" their bedroom.
Research suggests that OCD is caused by an imbalance of the brain chemical called serotonin. This imbalance can be genetic, even thought the disorder itself may not be hereditary. People with OCD experience unwanted, recurrent and disturbing thoughts they are powerless to suppress. This causes overwhelming anxiety, prompting them to perform repetitive, ritualized, compulsive behavior to alleviate the anxiety.
According to the National Institutes of Health, childhood OCD is more prevalent than other childhood ailments such as juvenile diabetes (100,000 cases in children 19 and under), yet remains largely undiagnosed and untreated. In young children, the disorder is often unrecognized because parents may attribute obsessive-compulsive behavior to a developmental stage and youngsters may not realize their thoughts and actions are unusual. Older children may hide their behavior, fearing that they are going crazy. Keeping this secret is exhausting and typically undermines a childâ€™s ability to function normally in school and at home. Relationships with family and friends deteriorate, and parents agonize over their childâ€™s peculiar behavior and hope ""the phase"" will pass quickly.
Children with OCD experience physical exhaustion and mental anguish from compulsive rituals such as repeated checking of school assignments, and obsessive fears such as harm coming to a family member as a result of household items being in disarray. Juvenile OCD can be particularly devastating because it coincides with a crucial period of social and emotional development. Schoolwork, home life and friendships are often affected.",
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride),"General Information
Paxil has been approved for the treatment of panic disorder, a disabling condition that will affect three to six million Americans at some time in their lives. Paxil belongs to a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
For many years, the only drug indicated for panic disorder was the benzodiazepine tranquilizer alprazolam. However, alprazolam is associated with dependence and is not indicated for long-term treatment of this chronic condition. Paxil has not been associated with the development of dependence in clinical trials and is indicated for long-term treatment of panic disorder.
In addition, alprazolam is not indicated for major depression, and as many as 65% of patients with panic disorder may also suffer from depression. Paxil is indicated for the treatment of depression as well as panic disorder.
For the treatment of panic disorder, the recommended target dose of Paxil is 40 mg per day. The starting dose is 10 mg per day, and dosage should not exceed 60 mg per day. Paxil is available in 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg tablets.
Paxil has also been approved as treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts that are intrusive and inappropriate, as well as distressing or anxiety-provoking. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors such as hand-washing or mental acts such as repeating words silently, and are aimed at reducing the distress or preventing some dreaded event.
The recommended dosage of Paxil in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder is 40 mg daily. The starting dose is 20 mg per day, and dosage should not exceed 60 mg per day.
Clinical Results
In one 10-week double-blind clinical study, 76% of subjects treated with 40 mg per day of Paxil were completely free of full panic attacks at the end point, compared with 44% of subjects who received placebo. Patients who responded to Paxil during the initial 10-week phase and a three-month double-blind extension phase were randomly assigned to continue on Paxil or be switched to placebo for an additional three months. Of the subjects switched to placebo, 30% experienced a relapse, as compared with only 5% of those who were treated with Paxil.
Paxil is the only SSRI that has demonstrated long-term maintenance of efficacy in a six-month relapse-prevention clinical trial. This is important because OCD is a chronic condition and often requires long-term treatment.
","Side Effects
Paxil was well tolerated in clinical trials for panic disorder and OCD. Side effects with an incidence of 10% or greater and at least twice that of placebo were sleepiness, nausea, abnormal ejaculation, dry mouth, constipation, dizziness, and tremor.
","Additional Information
Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden, unprovoked episode in which sufferers experience physical symptoms such as racing, pounding heartbeat, chest pain, breathlessness, and choking and may fear they are losing control or are in imminent danger of dying. Panic disorder is diagnosed when a person has:
persistent anxiety about having another attack
concern over the implications of the attacks or their consequences, including fear of life-threatening illness or ""losing control""
behavioral changes due to the attacks, including avoidance of everyday activities
Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from panic disorder, and the most common age of onset is the late teens and early twenties. Yet, panic attacks and panic disorder are found in people of all ages. Despite its prevalence, panic disorder is under diagnosed, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, which estimates that only one out of three panic disorder sufferers has been correctly diagnosed and treated.",

Obstetrics/Gynecology (Womenâ€™s Health),Activella (Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate) Tablets,"General Information
Activella has been approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with an intact uterus for prevention of osteoporosis. It is also indicated for several other symptoms associated with menopause, such as severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Activella is a combination hormone replacement therapy (HRT) tablet containing both estrogen and progestin. The tablet is administered once daily with a dosage of 1 mg of the estrogen (17beta-estradiol) and 0.5 mg of the progestin (norethindrone acetate).
Activella has already been approved in Europe for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis and has been marketed there under the name Activelle or Kliovance. Pharmacia & Upjohn, under terms of an agreement with Novo Nordisk, will be marketing the new HRT in the U.S.
Clinical Results
The effects of Activella on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) was investigated in the U.S. and in Europe in two multi-center, placebo-controlled studies. Participants were all postmenopausal women with intact uteri and baseline BMD values for lumbar spine within two standard deviations of the mean in healthy young women. Patients were randomized to groups given different dosages of either estradiol alone, norethindrone alone, a combination of the two (Activella), or placebo. Treatment was supplemented with calcium (500-1000 mg/day). In the United States and European studies, the mean percentage change in BMD between Activella and placebo was 5.9% and 6.3%, respectively.
Also, Activella yielded a statistically significant reduction in serum and urine markers of bone turnover. This effect was apparent after three months of treatment and was retained for the entire two-year treatment period.
","Side Effects
Common side effects include:
Breast tenderness/pain
Upper respiratory tract infections
Headache
Postmenopausal bleeding
Women who have been diagnosed with the following, should NOT take Activella:
Known or suspected pregnancy
Breast cancer
Estrogen- dependent neoplasia
Active deep vein thrombosis
Thromboembolic disorders or stroke
Undiagnosed genital bleeding
Liver dysfunction or disease
Hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients in the drug
Women who have had hysterectomies should NOT take Activella, as the existing data suggests that the combination therapy of estrogen and progestin may increase risk of glucose intolerance and less favorable effects on lipid metabolism in women without a uterus.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism, and estrogen replacement therapy acts to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.
Progestin compounds enhance cellular differentiation and generally oppose the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels, increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites, or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen. Progestins exert their effects in target cells by binding to specific progesterone receptors that interact with progesterone response elements in target genes. Progesterone receptors have been identified in the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, and central nervous system. Progestins produce similar endometrial changes to those of the naturally occurring hormone progesterone.

Obstetrics/Gynecology (Womenâ€™s Health),Addyi (flibanserin),"General Information
Addyi (flibanserin) is a serotonin 1A receptor agonist and a serotonin 2A receptor antagonist.
Addyi is specifically indicated for the treatment of premenopausal women with acquired, generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) as characterized by low sexual desire that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.
Addyi is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dosage is 100 mg taken once daily at bedtime. Addyi should be dosed at bedtime because administration during waking hours increases risks of hypotension, syncope, accidental injury, and central nervous system (CNS) depression. Discontinue treatment after 8 weeks if no improvement is observed.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Addyi was based on three 24- week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3). The three trials included premenopausal women with acquired, generalized HSDD of at least 6 months duration. In the clinical trials, acquired HSDD was defined as HSDD that developed in subjects who previously had no problems with sexual desire. Generalized HSDD was defined as HSDD that was not limited to certain types of stimulation, situations or partners. The subjects were treated with Addyi 100 mg once daily at bedtime (n = 1187) or placebo (n = 1188). These trials each had two co-primary efficacy endpoints, one for satisfying sexual events (SSEs) and the other for sexual desire:
The change from baseline to Week 24 in the number of monthly SSEs (i.e., sexual intercourse, oral sex, masturbation, or genital stimulation by the partner). The SSEs were based on patient responses to the following questions: â€œDid you have a sexual event?â€� and â€œWas the sex satisfying for you?â€�
Studies 1 and 2 had a different sexual desire endpoint than Study 3:
In Studies 1 and 2, the sexual desire co-primary endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 24 in the calculated monthly sexual desire score and was based on patient responses to the question: â€œIndicate your most intense level of sexual desire.â€� Every day, patients rated their sexual desire level from 0 (no desire) to 3 (strong desire) and recorded their response in an electronic Diary (eDiary). These responses were summed over a 28-day period to yield the calculated monthly sexual desire score, which ranged from 0 to 84.
In Study 3, the desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI Desire) was the sexual desire co-primary endpoint. The desire domain of the FSFI has two questions. The first question asks patients â€œOver the past 4 weeks, how often did you feel sexual desire or interest?â€�, with responses ranging from 1 (almost never or never) to 5 (almost always or always). The second question asks patients â€œOver the past 4 weeks, how would you rate your level (degree) of sexual desire or interest?â€�, with responses ranging from 1 (very low or none at all) to 5 (very high). The FSFI Desire score was calculated by adding the patientâ€™s responses to these two questions then multiplying that sum by 0.6. The FSFI Desire domain score ranged from 1.2 to 6.
In all three trials, Addyi resulted in statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in the change from baseline in monthly SSEs at Week 24. In Study 1 and 2, there were no statistically significant differences between Addyi and placebo for the eDiary sexual desire endpoint (change in baseline to Week 24). In contrast, in Study 3 there was statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline to Week 24 in sexual desire (using the FSFI Desire Domain) with Addyi compared to placebo.

Afinitor (everolimus), an inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), is an antineoplastic agent.
Afinitor is specifically approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer (advanced HR+ BC) in combination with exemestane, after failure of treatment with letrozole or anastrozole.
Afinitor is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose of Afinitor for breast cancer is 10 mg, to be taken once daily, at the same time every day, either consistently with food or consistently without food.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Afinitor for the treatment of advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer was based on a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study in 724 postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, HER 2/neu-negative advanced breast cancer with recurrence or progression following prior therapy with letrozole or anastrozole. The subjects were randomized to Afinitor 10 mg/day plus exemestane 25 mg/day (n = 485) or to placebo plus exemestane 25 mg/day (n = 239). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), based on investigator (local radiology) assessment. The median progression-free survival at the time of the final PFS analysis was 7.8 and 3.2 months in the Afinitor and placebo arms, respectively [p < 0.0001].

Obstetrics/Gynecology (Womenâ€™s Health),Alesse (100 mcg levonorgestrel/20 mcg ethinyl estradiol tablets),"General Information
Alesse (100 mcg levonorgestrel/20 mcg ethinyl estradiol tablets), a new low-dose birth control pill, has been approved for marketing. New Alesse represents the lowest dose combination of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol marketed in the United States. Alesse contains 100 mcg of the progestin levonorgestrel, the most widely prescribed contraceptive progestin, and 20 mcg of ethinyl estradiol, the estrogen most frequently used in oral contraceptives. More than 40 percent of oral contraceptive prescriptions worldwide contain levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol. Alesse, packaged in the Mini-Pack, is available in 21- and 28-day regimens. The Mini-Pack, developed by Wyeth-Ayerst, represents the smallest oral contraceptive packaging available. It has several convenient features to help women remember to take their birth control pill daily and in the prescribed sequence.
Alesse, like other oral contraceptive, has proven to be more than 99 percent effective when taken as directed. In addition, birth control pills may provide protection from ovarian and endometrial cancer and pelvic inflammatory disease. They also may make a womanâ€™s period less painful by reducing cramps and increase menstrual cycle regularity. Women who use Alesse or other oral contraceptives may experience iron-deficiency anemia and ectopic pregnancy less frequently.
","Side Effects
Common side effects associated with oral contraceptives include nausea, headache and breast tenderness. Serious side effects occur infrequently, especially if a woman is in good health and does not smoke. These may include blood clots, heart disease, stroke, liver tumors and gallbladder disease. Several studies have found no overall increase in the risk of developing breast cancer in women taking oral contraceptives. Some women should not use oral contraceptives, including those who have had blood clots, certain cancers, or a history of heart attack or stroke, as well as those who are or may be pregnant.
","Additional Information
Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects. This risk increases with age and is most pronounced in women older than age 35. Women on oral contraceptives should not smoke. In addition, oral contraceptives do not protect a woman against HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases.",
Obstetrics/Gynecology (Womenâ€™s Health),Alora,"General Information
Alora is an estrogen replacement therapy system approved for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. In 1996, Alora was approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor menopausal symptoms, specifically hot flashes. The Alora patch is thin, flexible and virtually transparent when worn on the skin. The patch can be placed on the abdomen, hip or buttock and is available in four dosage strengths. It is applied twice weekly and is worn continuously for three or four days.
Osteoporosis is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaken and more prone to breakage. Women who undergo menopause at an early age, are thin, smoke or have a family history of osteoporosis are more likely to develop this debilitating disease.
Clinical Results
Approval of Alora is supported by a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 268 postmenopausal women who experienced an average of at least 60 moderate-to-severe hot flashes during the screening period. At weeks four and 12, Alora was seen to be statistically better than placebo at relieving the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms.
Alora was also tested in clinical trials in 355 hysterectomized, non-osteoporotic women to measure the drug's effect on bone mineral density (BMD). Alora was shown to increase lumbar spine BMD statistically better than placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Alora may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Headache
Nausea
Vomiting
Breast tenderness or enlargement
Retention of excess fluid
Vaginal spotting or bleeding
","Additional Information
For additional information on Alora, please visit Alora.","Mechanism of Action
Alora (estradiol) is a transdermal system designed to deliver estradiol, a human estrogen. Estrogens bind to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues and modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogen replacement therapy acts to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.
The skin metabolizes estradiol only to a small extent compared to orally adminstered estradiol, which is rapidly metabolized into estrone, leading to higher circulating levels of estrone than estradiol. Transdermal administration then, produces therapeutic estradiol levels with lower levels of estrone and requires smaller doses.

Obstetrics/Gynecology (Womenâ€™s Health),Aredia (pamidronate disodium for injection),"General Information
Aredia has been approved for treatment of osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer, in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy. Aredia is the first drug that has been proven to reduce the incidence of skeletal complications of metastatic breast cancer, thereby reducing the need for radiation therapy or surgery to the bone. It has also been shown to provide relief of bone pain caused by metastatic breast cancer, thereby reducing the need for narcotic analgesics. The drug is also indicated for the treatment of osteolytic bone lesions of multiple myeloma, moderate-to-severe hypercalcemia of malignancy, and moderate-to-severe Paget's disease.
Clinical Results
The marketing clearance was based upon data from two large, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies in breast cancer subjects with osteolytic bone metastases. These studies enrolled 372 subjects treated with hormonal therapy and 382 subjects treated with chemotherapy. All subjects enrolled had stage IV breast cancer with two or more lytic lesions, with at least one lesion that was one centimeter or greater in diameter. Subjects were randomized to receive Aredia 90 mg every three to four weeks via two-hour IV infusions for 12 months or matching placebo, in conjunction with either hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. The studies demonstrated that patients receiving Aredia had a significant reduction in skeletal complications, the primary endpoint, and significant relief of bone pain, a secondary endpoint. The Aredia treatment effect appeared to be less pronounced in the study of those receiving chemotherapy. Additionally, subjects receiving Aredia had fewer pathologic fractures and a decreased need for radiation therapy for pain or skeletal complications.
In these studies, skeletal morbidity was defined as the mean number of skeletal complications (pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, radiation therapy, or surgery to bone) per subject per year. In subjects receiving concomitant chemotherapy, Aredia provided a 36% reduction in the skeletal morbidity rate (2.1 vs. 3.3 with placebo). In subjects receiving concomitant hormonal therapy, skeletal morbidity was reduced by 31% with Aredia (2.4 vs. 3.5). For an average subject, these reductions mean one fewer major skeletal complication per year with Aredia.
Additional results of the trials show that subjects treated with Aredia had fewer skeletal complications than those subjects who received placebo. Also, fewer Aredia-treated subjects required radiation therapy for pain, or to prevent or treat fractures, compared to subjects treated with placebo. Among subjects who had pain at the beginning of the trials, Ardia-treated subjects had less severe pain, and experienced pain less often, in comparison to subjects who did not receive Aredia. Additionally, Aredia-treated subjects also had a decreased need for strong pain medication, unlike subjects receiving placebo. The statistical significance of these results may be overstated due to numerous analyses.
","Side Effects
The incidence and type of adverse events with Aredia were similar to those with placebo, with most events likely due to the underlying disease or concomitant antineoplastic therapy. The most frequent adverse events were fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, anemia, and skeletal pain. Transient arthralgias and myalgias were reported slightly more frequently with Aredia than with antineoplastic therapy alone (12% and 23% vs. 8% and 17%, respectively). Serum calcium and electrolytes must be closely monitored, as must subjects with preexisting anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia.
","Additional Information
Breast cancer is diagnosed in approximately 184,000 women each year, and has the highest incidence of associated metastatic bone disease among all cancers. Approximately 100,000 breast cancer subjects are currently living with cancer that has metastasized to the bone. Subjects with osteolytic bone metastases often suffer from skeletal complications including pathologic bone fractures, spinal cord compression, impaired mobility, and chronic and debilitating bone pain.",
Obstetrics/Gynecology (Womenâ€™s Health),Arimidex (anastrozole),"General Information
Arimidex has been approved as a treatment for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following therapy with tamoxifen.
Clinical Results
The FDA made its decision after evaluating results of clinical studies involving more than 750 subjects. Results from the two studies showed that Arimidex is effective in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.
","Side Effects
Most commonly reported side effects, regardless of causality, included fatigue, nausea, headache, hot flashes, pain and back pain. Arimidex is not associated with significant weight gain reported with progestins.
","Additional Information
Approximately one woman in eight will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 184,300 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996. It is estimated that about 6% of patients with breast cancer in the United States. have advanced breast cancer.","Mechanism of Action
Results from studies suggest that growth of some breast cancer tumors is stimulated by the female hormone estrogen. Arimidex, a nonsteroidal compound, is the first entry in a new class of third-generation selective oral aromatase inhibitors. Inhibition of aromatase reduces the production of estrogen. Thus, Arimidex reduces serum concentration of estrogen, an effect that has been shown to be of benefit in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.
"
Obstetrics/Gynecology (Womenâ€™s Health),Aromasin Tablets,"General Information
Aromasin, a new drug to treat post-menopausal advanced breast cancer in patients for whom treatment with tamofixen was ineffective, has been shown to inhibit the production of estrogen, upon which some breast cancer cells depend. Furthermore, studies indicate that Aromasin, which reduces the risk of tumor progression by 18 percent and the risk of death by 23 percent, is more beneficial than the hormone therapy, megestrol acetate.
In post-menopausal women, the principle source of estrogen comes from the conversion of adrenal and ovarian androgens to estrogens by the aromatase (exemestane) enzyme. For post-menopausal women with hormone-dependent breast cancer, Aromasin serves as an aromatase inhibitor. As a result, the concentrations of estrogen, on which breast cancer cells may depend, are lowered. This estrogen-depriving process nicknamed, ""suicide inhibition,"" is irreversible. However, it does not affect other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway up to a concentration at least 600 times higher than that inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.
Warnings/Precautions:
Aromasin should not be administered to premenopausal women. Neither should it be coadministered with estrogen-containing agents.
Pregnant women should not take Aromasin, as it could pose a potential hazard to the fetus, and could cause potential loss of the pregnancy.
Aromasin has not yet been tested for pediatric patients.
Clinical Results
A phase III, double blind, randomized study was conducted for 769 post-menopausal patients whose breast cancer had metastasized (spread). The study compared the effects of Aromasin versus those of megestrol acetate on survival, tumor reduction, and duration of disease stabilization. Patients taking megestrol acetate had a median survival (estimated time at which 50 percent of the patients were still alive) of approximately 28 months, while patients taking Aromasin had a median survival significantly longer than 28 months (p< 0.039). Moreover, the progression of cancer was delayed longer in patients taking Aromasin (4.7 months) than in patients taking megestrol acetate (3.8 months). Also, 15 percent of patients treated with Aromasin experienced at least a 50 percent or greater reduction in the size of the tumor or a complete disappearance of all known lesions. This suggested a possible advantage over the 12.4 percent of patients treated with megestrol acetate who experienced this effect, although the difference was not statistically significant. Finally, the regiment for taking Aromasin is one 25mg pill taken daily, versus the 40mg pill of megestrol acetate taken four times daily. Based on the study's results, researchers are confident that Aromasin provides greater benefit than megestrol acetate.
","Side Effects
In clinical trials, any adverse effects were generally described as mild to moderate. Some Aromasin use was associated with low-grade nausea, hot-flashes, fatigue, increased sweating, and increased appetite. However, only 7.6% of patients experienced undesirable weight gain (lower than the rate caused by magestrol acetate).
Warnings/Precautions
Aromasin should not be administered to premenopausal women. Neither should it be coadministered with estrogen-containing agents. Pregnant women should not take Aromasin, as it could pose a potential hazard to the fetus, and could cause potential loss of the pregnancy.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Exemestane is an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator, structurally related to the natural substrate androstenedione. It acts as a false substrate for the aromatase enzyme and is processed to an intermediate that binds irreversibly to the active site of the enzyme causing its inactivation. Exemestane significantly lowers circulating estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women, but has no detectable effect on adrenal biosynthesis of corticosteroids or aldosterone. (FDA Label)"

Obstetrics/Gynecology (Womenâ€™s Health),Bextra,"General Information
On April 7, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asked Pfizer to voluntarily remove Bextra (valdecoxib) from the market. This request was made citing the potential for increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and the well described, serious, potential life-threatening gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding outweighs the benefit of Bextra treatment.
Bextra is approved to treat the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA), adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the treatment of pain associated with menstrual cramping. Bextra has previously been approved for relief from arthritis pain. Bextra is a once-daily treatment in an oral tablet formulation.
More than 23 million Americans suffer from some form of arthritis. The most prevalent is OA, which affects approximately 21 million Americans. This chronic disorder is characterized by the degeneration of joint cartilage and bone, which can lead to severe pain and stiffness. RA, which affects joint lining, cartilage and bone, affects over two million Americans.
Clinical Results
The approval of Bextra is supported by results from clinical studies lasting from three to six months. In five double-blind trials with 3,918 subjects with OA of the knee or hip, Bextra was significantly superior to placebo and comparable to a naproxen control, in treating pain and stiffness and improving functional measures. In four double-blind trials with 3,444 subjects with RA, Bextra demonstrated significantly better results than placebo and comparable results to naproxen in improving the tenderness and number of swollen joints and the level of pain. Bextra was evaluated for treatment of menstrual pain in two placebo-controlled studies. The onset, magnitude and duration of analgesic effect of a 20 mg dose of Bextra was comparable to a 500 mg dose of naproxen.

Obstetrics/Gynecology (Womenâ€™s Health),Cenestin,"General Information
Cenestin has been approved to reduce moderate or severe menopausal symptoms.
Estrogens are hormones made by the ovaries of normal women. Between ages 45 and 55, the ovaries normally stop making estrogens. This leads to a drop in body estrogen levels which causes menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). If both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place, the sudden drop in estrogen levels causes surgical menopause.
When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden intense episodes of heat and sweating (hot flashes). Using estrogen drugs can help the body adjust to lower estrogen levels and reduce these symptoms. Most women have only mild menopausal symptoms or none at all and do not need to use estrogen drugs for these symptoms. Others may need to take estrogens for a few months while their bodies adjust to lower estrogen levels. The majority of women do not need estrogen replacement for longer than six months for these symptoms.
Clinical Results
A randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical study was conducted evaluating the effectiveness of Cenestin for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms in 120 menopausal women. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo or 0.625 mg Cenestin daily for 12 weeks. Dose titration was allowed after one week of treatment. The starting dose was either doubled (2 x 0.625 mg Cenestin or placebo taken daily) or reduced (0.3 mg Cenestin or placebo taken daily), if necessary.
Efficacy was assessed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. By Week 12, 10% of the study participants remained on a single 0.625 mg Cenestin tablet daily while 77% required two (0.625 mg) tablets daily. The results indicate that compared to placebo, Cenestin produced a reduction in moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms at all time points
","Side Effects
In addition to the risks listed above, the following side effects have been reported with estrogen use:
Nausea and vomiting
Breast tenderness or enlargement
Enlargement of benign tumors of the uterus (fibroids)
Retention of excess fluid
Spotty darkening of the skin, particularly on the face
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Estrogens should not be used in individuals with any of the following conditions:
Known or suspected pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS)
Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding
Known or suspected cancer of the breast (except in appropriately selected patients being treated for metastatic disease)
Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia
Active thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders
","Additional Information
Estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 Âµg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.
Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, leutinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism and estrogen replacement therapy acts to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.","Mechanism of Action
DESCRIPTION
Synthetic conjugated estrogens, A tablets contain a blend of nine (9) synthetic estrogenic substances. The estrogenic substances are sodium estrone sulfate, sodium equilin sulfate, sodium 17a-dihydroequilin sulfate, sodium 17a-estradiol sulfate, sodium 17b-dihydroequilin sulfate, sodium 17a-dihydroequilenin sulfate, sodium 17b-dihydroequilenin sulfate, sodium equilenin sulfate and sodium 17b-estradiol sulfate.

Obstetrics/Gynecology (Womenâ€™s Health),"Cervarix [Human Papillomavirus Bivalent (Types 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant","General Information
Cervarix is a virus-like particle combination vaccine consisting of self-assembling, virus-like particles based on HPV-16 and HPV-18. It was designed to elicit an immune response against the human papilloma virus (HPV).
Cervarix is specifically indicated for the prevention of the following diseases caused by oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18: cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or worse and adenocarcinoma in situ and CI) grade 1 in females 10 through 25 years of age.
Cervarix is supplied as a suspension for intramuscular injection. The recommended administration is 3 doses of 0.5-mL each, by intramuscular injection at 0, 1, and 6 months.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Cervarix was based on two double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical studies that enrolled a total of 19,778 females 15 through 25 years of age.
Study One (HPV001)
This study enrolled women who were negative for oncogenic HPV DNA in cervical samples, seronegative for HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies and had normal cytology. This population was presumed ""naÃ¯ve"" without current HPV infection at the time of vaccination and without prior exposure to either HPV-16 or HPV-18. Twelve-month persistent infection was evaluated as an efficacy endpoint. There were five cases of 12-month persistent HPV-16/18 infection (4 HPV-16; 1 HPV-18) in the control group and one HPV-16 case in the vaccine group in study 001.
Study Two (HPV008)
In this study women were vaccinated regardless of baseline HPV DNA status, serostatus or cytology. This population was naÃ¯ve (without current infection and without prior exposure) or non-naÃ¯ve (with current infection and/or with prior exposure) to HPV. Cervarix provided a high and statistically significant level of efficacy against pre-cancerous lesions associated with each of the HPV types included in the vaccine (HPV 16 and HPV 18). In addition, the data demonstrated that the vaccine also provided type-specific protection against pre-cancerous lesions associated with some additional common cancer-causing HPV types other than HPV 16 and HPV 18. In women without evidence of prior cancer-causing HPV infection the overall efficacy demonstrated against any lesion, regardless of HPV type, was much greater than would be expected for a vaccine targeting only HPV types 16 and 18.
Study 1 and Study 1 Extension
In Study 1 and Study 1 Extension, with up to 6.4 years of follow-up (mean 5.9 years), in naÃ¯ve females 15 through 25 years of age, efficacy against CIN2/3 or AIS associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18 was 100%. Efficacy against 12-month persistent infection with HPV-16 or HPV-18 was 100%.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use if Cervarix may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Pain
Redness
Swelling at the injection site
Fatigue
Headache
Myalgia
Gastrointestinal symptoms
Arthralgia
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Cervarix or the prevention of cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia caused by HPV types 16 and 18, please visit the Cervarix web page.","Mechanism of Action
Cervarix is a non-infectious recombinant, AS04-adjuvanted vaccine that contains recombinant L1 protein, the major antigenic protein of the capsid, of oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18. It is thought that the efficacy of the vaccine may be mediated by the development of IgG neutralizing antibodies directed against HPV-L1 capsid proteins generated as a result of vaccination.

Obstetrics/Gynecology (Womenâ€™s Health),Cetrotide,"General Information
Cetrotide has been developed to prevent premature ovulation in women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Cetrotide blocks the effects of a natural hormone, called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH controls the secretion of another hormone, called luteinizing hormone (LH), which induces ovulation during the menstrual cycle. During hormone treatment for ovarian stimulation, premature ovulation may lead to eggs that are not suitable for fertilization. Cetrotide blocks such undesirable premature ovulation.
Clinical Results
The effectiveness of Cetrotide has been examined in five clinical trials (two phase II and three phase III trials). Two dose regimens were investigated in these trials: either a single dose per treatment cycle or multiple dosing. In the phase II studies, a single dose of 3 mg was established as the minimal effective dose for the inhibition of premature LH surges with a protection period of at least four days. When Cetrotide is administered in a multidose regimen, 0.25 mg was established as the minimal effective dose. The extent and duration of LH-suppression was found to be dose dependent.
In the phase III program, efficacy of the single 3 mg dose regimen and the multiple 0.25 mg dose regimen was established separately in two controlled studies utilizing active comparitors. A third non-comparative study evaluated only the multiple 0.25 mg dose regimen of Cetrotide.
In the five phase II and phase III trials, 184 pregnancies have been reported out of a total of 732 patients (including 21 pregnancies following the replacement of frozen-thawed embryos). No drug related allergic reactions were reported from these clinical studies. (from FDA Label)
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with Cetrotide include (but are not limited to) the following:
Reddening, itching, or swelling at injection site
Nausea
Headache
Additionally, Cetrotide should not be used by individuals who are or may be pregnant.
","Additional Information
For further information on Cetrotide, please visit the web site of Asta Medica","Mechanism of Action
GnRH induces the production and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the gonadotrophic cells of the anterior pituitary. Due to a positive estradiol feedback at midcycle, GnRH liberation is enhanced resulting in an LH-surge. This LH-surge induces the ovulation of the dominant follicle, resumption of oocyte meiosis and subsequently luteinization as indicated by rising progesterone levels.
Cetrotide competes with natural GnRH for binding to membrane receptors on pituitary cells and thus controls the release of LH and FSH in a dose-dependent manner. The onset of LH suppression is approximately one hour with the 3 mg dose and two hours with the 0.25 mg dose. This suppression is maintained by continuous treatment and there is a more pronounced effect on LH than on FSH. An initial release of endogenous gonadotropins has not been detected with Cetrotide, which is consistent with an antagonist effect. (from FDA Label)

"
Ocular Hypertension,Betaxon,"General Information
Betaxon (levobetaxolol hydrochloride suspension, drops) is an ophthalmic suspension which, when instilled in the eye, reduces intraocular pressure (IOP), a major risk factor in glaucomatous field loss. Elevated IOP accounts for greater likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss. Most of the diseases of the eye which cause glaucoma are characterized by increased IOP.
Currently, there is no cure for glaucoma. Furthermore, since there are no obvious symptoms, it is difficult to detect glaucoma before serious loss of sight is experienced. The best defense is to have regular eye exams. See below for a list of populations that are of higher risk for developing glaucoma.
Clinical Results
In two clinical research studies in which a total of 365 patients were dosed for three months with the study drug, Betaxon was shown to significantly reduce IOP at all follow up visits.
","Side Effects
The main adverse effects experienced by patients in clinical trials included:
Discomfort of the eye upon treatment
Blurred vision
Cataracts and vitreous disorders (experienced by less than 2% of the patients)
In addition, the same adverse reactions that may occur with systemic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may result from this topically applied beta-adrenergic blocking agent. These effects may include:
Severe respiratory reactions
Severe cardiac reactions
Betaxon is contraindicated in patients with sinus bradycardia, greater than a first degree atrioventricular block, cardiogenic shock, or patients with over cardiac failure.
Results of clinical research indicate that this drug may have a minor effect on heart rate and blood pressure.
","Additional Information
According to the Glaucoma Foundation, you may be at greater risk for developing the glaucoma if:
you are over 45 and have not had your eyes examined regularly
someone in your family has a history of glaucoma
you have abnormally high intraocular pressure
you are of African descent
you have diabetes
you are myopic (nearsighted)
you have had regular, long-term steroid/cortisone use
you have had previous eye injury","Mechanism of Action
Since racemic betaxolol and other beta-adrenergic antagonists have been shown to reduce intraocular pressure by a reduction of aqueous production as demonstrated by tonography and aqueous flourophotometry, it is assumed that the mechanism of action of levobetaxolol is similar. The intraocular lowering effect of racemic betaxolol can generally be noted within 30 minutes and the maximal effect can usually be detected two hours after topical administration. It is assumed that the intraocular lowering time profile of levobetaxolol is similar. A single dose provides approximately a 12-hour reduction in intraocular pressure. (FDA Label)

Ocular Hypertension,Lumigan (bimatoprost ophthalmic solution),"General Information
Lumigan has been approved by the FDA for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are intolerant of or insufficiently responsive to other IOP-lowering medications. Bimatoprost, the active ingredient in Lumigan, is a synthetic prostamide analog - it acts by mimicking the effects of prostamides, which are naturally occurring substances. It is believed to lower intraocular pressure by increasing the outflow of fluid (known as aqueous humor) produced by the eye.
There are approximately two to three million individuals in the United States with glaucoma, a condition often associated with elevated intraocular pressure leading to optic nerve damage. Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness for which there is currently no cure; however, recent opinion suggests that achieving a low level of IOP may slow the progression of the disease.
Clinical Results
Phase III trial results demonstrated that 64% of subjects receiving Lumigan once daily achieved target IOP of less than or equal to 17 mm Hg, whereas 37% of subjects receiving timolol twice daily, a leading drug used to lower IOP, achieved the same target pressure. At six months, Lumigan produced a 33% reduction in IOP compared to 23% with timolol (8.1 mm Hg vs. 5.6 mm Hg, respectively).
","Side Effects
In clinical trials, adverse events occurring in approximately 15% to 45% of subjects included (but are not limited to) the following:

More than 60% of patients taking Rocklatan in the two MERCURY studies achieved an IOP reduction of 30% or more; nearly twice that achieved by patients taking latanoprost alone. Rocklatan also helped more patients get to low target pressures. Nearly twice as many patients taking Rocklatan reached 16 mmHg or lower and nearly three times as many reached 14 mmHg or lower compared to latanoprost.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Rocklatan may include, but are not limited to, the following:
conjunctival hyperemia
instillation site pain
corneal verticillata
conjunctival hemorrhage
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Rocklatan or elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, please visit http://investors.aeriepharma.com/","Mechanism of Action
Rocklatan is a fixed-dose combination of latanoprost (0.05 mg/mL (0.005%), a prostaglandin analog (PGA), and netarsudil (0.2 mg/mL (0.02%), a first-in-class Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. It is specifically designed to target the trabecular meshwork (the eyeâ€™s principal drainage pathway). The diseased trabecular meshwork is considered to be the main cause of elevated IOP in open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.

Ocular Hypertension,Travatan (travoprost ophthalmic solution),"General Information
Travatan has been approved by the FDA for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. It is indicated for patients who are intolerant of or insufficiently responsive to other intraocular pressure lowering medications.
Travoprost, the active ingredient in Travatan, is a synthetic prostaglandin analogue. It targets the prostanoid receptor and is believed to reduce intraocular pressure by increasing the drainage of fluid (aqueous humor) from the eye.
There are approximately two to three million individuals in the United States with glaucoma, a condition often associated with elevated intraocular pressure leading to optic nerve damage. Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness, accounting for approximately 12% of all new cases in the United States each year. While glaucoma significantly affects all races and ages, it appears to particularly target individuals of African descent, appearing at an earlier age and progressing at a more rapid rate. Travatan, unlike other glaucoma treatments, has demonstrated greater effectiveness in African-American patients.
Clinical Results
Trial results demonstrated that subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were treated with Travatan Ophthalmic Solution 0.004% experienced 7-8 mm Hg reductions in intraocular pressure. Subjects had a baseline pressure of 25-27 mm Hg and were dosed once-daily in the evening. Subgroup analyses of these trials showed that mean IOP reduction in African-American subjects was up to 1.8 mm Hg greater than in non-African-American subjects. At this time, it is not known whether this difference is due to race or to heavily pigmented irides.
A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of Travatan dosed adjunctively to Timoptic. Results showed that subjects with a mean baseline intraocular pressure of 24-26 mm Hg on Timoptic 0.5% BID who were treated with Travatan 0.004% dosed QD adjunctively to Timoptic 0.5% BID demonstrated 6-7 mm Hg reductions in intraocular pressure.
","Side Effects
The use of Travatan has been associated with possibly permanent changes in pigmented tissues, including increased pigmentation of the iris and periorbital tissue (eyelid) and increased pigmentation and growth of eyelashes.
The most common eye-related adverse event reported in clinical trials was ocular hyperemia, which was reported in 35 to 50% of subjects. Other events included (but are not limited to) the following:
Decreased visual acuity
Eye discomfort
Foreign body sensation
Pain
Pruritus
","Additional Information
Travatan should not be administered while wearing contact lenses - the drug contains benzalkonium chloride, which may be absorbed by the lens. Additionally, contact between the tip of the container and the eye or surrounding area should be avoided when administering Travatan. This contact could cause the tip to become contaminated and result in ocular infection.
If you are interested in learning more about glaucoma, please visit the National Institutes of Health, National Eye Institute.
Additional information on Travatan can be obtained by visiting Alcon.","Mechanism of Action
Travoprost free acid is a selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist which is believed to reduce intraocular pressure by increasing uveoscleral outflow. The exact mechanism of action is unknown at this time. (from Travatan Label)

Ocular Hypertension,Vyzulta (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution),"General Information
Vyzulta (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution) is a nitric oxide-donating prostaglandin F2-alpha analog.
Vyzulta is specifically indicated for the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
Vyzulta is supplied as a solution for topical ophthalmic administration. The recommended dosage is one drop in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. Do not administer Vyzulta 0.024% more than once daily as t has been shown that more frequent administration of prostaglandin analogs may lessen the intraocular pressure lowering effect. If Vyzulta is to be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower intraocular pressure, administer each drug product at least five (5) minutes apart.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Vyzulta was based on two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, parallel-group Phase III studies, APOLLO and LUNAR, comparing Vyzulta with timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.5% in subjects (N=831) with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The primary objective of these studies was to demonstrate that the mean IOP reduction over 3 months of treatment with Vyzulta once daily (QD) in the evening was non-inferior to timolol 0.5% twice daily (BID). A secondary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of Vyzulta QD to timolol 0.5% BID. In both studies, Vyzulta met the primary efficacy endpoint. VYZULTA also demonstrated significantly greater IOP lowering than timolol 0.5% throughout the day at 3 months of treatment resulting in a reduction in mean diurnal IOP of 32% from baseline.
In addition, in a phase II study, VOYAGER, (n=413), treatment with Vyzulta showed greater IOP reduction vs. Xalatan (latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005%) with differences reaching 1.23mmHg (P=0.005) for Vyzulta. More subjects in the Vyzulta arm achieved a mean diurnal IOP â‰¤18mmHg vs. the Xalatan arm. In the phase III JUPITER study (n=130), treatment with Vyzulta led to a 22% mean reduction in IOP at Week 4, which was sustained through Week 52. At Week 52, the data showed a 26% reduction from baseline in the study eye. In the phase III CONSTELLATION study, treatment with Vyzulta lowered IOP over 24 hours with a significantly greater nocturnal IOP reduction vs. timolol (P<0.004). Vyzulta-treated patients reported improved daytime ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) vs. baseline (P<0.001) and nocturnal OPP vs. timolol 0.5%(P=0.01) over a 24-hour period.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Vyzulta may include, but are not limited to, the following:
conjunctival hyperemia
eye irritation
eye pain
instillation site pain
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Vyzulta or the reduction of intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, please visit http://www.vyzulta.com/hcp/","Mechanism of Action
Vyzulta (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution) is a nitric oxide-donating prostaglandin F2-alpha analog. Latanoprostene bunod is thought to lower intraocular pressure by increasing outflow of aqueous humor through both the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral routes. Intraocular pressure is a major modifiable risk factor for glaucoma progression. Reduction of intraocular pressure reduces risk of glaucomatous visual field loss

Ocular Hypertension,Zioptan (tafluprost ophthalmic solution),"General Information
Zioptan (tafluprost ophthalmic solution) is a fluorinated analog of prostaglandin F2a. It acts on the same receptors in the eye as the natural prostaglandins. It causes an increase in the drainage of aqueous humour out of the eyeball, which decreases the pressure within the eye.
Zioptan was specifically approved for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
Zioptan is supplied as a solution for intraocular injection. The recommended initial dose is one drop in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Zioptan was based on clinical studies up to 24 months in duration. Subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and baseline pressure of 23 - 26 mm Hg were treated with Zioptan dosed once daily in the evening. Zioptan demonstrated reductions in intraocular pressure at 3 and 6 months of 6 to 8 mmHg and 5 to 8 mmHg, respectively.

Oncology,Abraxane (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension),"General Information
Abraxane (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) is an intravenous nanoparticle, albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel, a cancer chemotherapy, that is protein-stable and Cremophor-free. It was designed to deliver a greater amount of chemotherapy to cancer cells with fewer side effects.
Abraxane is specifically indicated for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in combination with carboplatin, in patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy.
Abraxane is supplied as a solution for intravenous injection. The recommended dose is 100 mg/m2 administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. The recommended dose of carboplatin is AUC = 6 mg min/mL on Day 1 only of each 21-day cycle, beginning immediately after the completion of Abraxane administration.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Abraxane for non-small cell lung cancer was based on a multicenter, randomized, open-label conducted in 1052 chemonaive patients with Stage IIIb/IV non-small cell lung cancer. The trial was designed to compare Abraxane in combination with carboplatin to paclitaxel injection in combination with carboplatin as first-line treatment. Abraxane was administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. Paclitaxel injection was administered as an intravenous infusion over 3 hours at a dose of 200 mg/m2, following premedication. In both treatment arms carboplatin at a dose of AUC = 6 mg min/mL was administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle after completion of Abraxane/paclitaxel infusion. Treatment was administered until disease progression or development of an unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy outcome was overall response rate. Subjects in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm had a statistically significantly higher overall response rate compared to those in the paclitaxel injection/carboplatin arm (33% versus 25%). There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two study arms.

For additional information regarding Abraxane or non-small cell lung cancer, please visit the Abraxane web page.","Mechanism of Action
Abraxane is a microtubule inhibitor that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. Paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays (or bundles) of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.

Oncology,Abstral (fentanyl sublingual tablets),"General Information
Abstral is a sublingual tablet formulation of fentanyl citrate, a potent opioid analgesic. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown.
Abstral is specifically indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving, and who are tolerant to, opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain.
Abstral is supplied as a sublingual tablet designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is a single 100 mcg tablet. If adequate analgesia is obtained within 30 minutes of administration of the 100 mcg tablet, continue to treat subsequent episodes of breakthrough pain with this dose. If adequate analgesia is not obtained after the initial dose, the patient may use a second Abstral dose (after 30 minutes) as directed by their health care provider. No more than two doses of Abstral may be used to treat an episode of breakthrough pain. Patients must wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough pain. The Abstral dose should be escalated in a stepwise manner, increased by 100 mcg multiples up to 400 mcg, over consecutive breakthrough episodes until adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects is achieved.
Clinical Results
FDA Approvals
The FDA approval of Abstral was based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 131 subjects experiencing breakthrough cancer pain. Breakthrough cancer pain was defined as a transient flare of moderate-to-severe pain occurring in patients experiencing persistent cancer pain otherwise controlled with maintenance doses of opioid medications. Of the 131 subjects who entered the titration phase of the study, 78 (60%) achieved a successful dose during the titration phase. Sixty-six patients entered the double-blind phase and 60 completed the study. The primary outcome measure, the mean sum of pain intensity difference at 30 minutes (SPID30) for Abstral-treated episodes was statistically significantly higher than for placebo-treated episodes. In a second open-label safety study using an identical titration regimen, 96 of 139 patients (69%) who entered the study titrated to a dose in which the patient obtained adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects during the titration phase.

Afinitor is an inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers. Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation and inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies.
Afinitor is specifically indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib.
Afinitor is supplied as a 5 mg or 10 mg tablet designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 10 mg, to be taken once daily at the same time every day, either with or without food. Afinitor tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water; they should not be chewed or crushed.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Afinitor was based on the results of a clinical trial. This international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study enrolled 416 subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with sunitinib, sorafenib, or both sequentially. The subjects received Afinitor 10 mg once daily or placebo, both in conjunction with best cupportive care. After documented radiological progression, subjects could be unblinded by the investigator: those randomized to placebo were then able to receive open-label Afinitor 10 mg daily. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), documented using RECIST criteria. The median progression-free survival was 4.9 months for Afinitor versus 1.9 months for placebo (p<0.0001).

Oncology,Akynzeo (netupitant and palonosetron),"General Information
Akynzeo is a fixed combination of netupitant, a substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist, and palonosetron, a serotonin-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist. Oral palonosetron prevents nausea and vomiting during the acute phase and netupitant prevents nausea and vomiting during both the acute and delayed phase after cancer chemotherapy.
Akynzeo is specifically indicated for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of cancer chemotherapy, including, but not limited to, highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
Akynzeo is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. Akynzeo should be administered approximately 1 hour prior to the start of chemotherapy, woth or without food.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Akynzeo was based on two trials.
Trial One
In a multicenter, randomized, parallel, double-blind, controlled clinical trial of 694 patients, the efficacy and safety of a single dose of oral netupitant in combination with oral palonosetron was compared with a single oral dose of palonosetron in cancer patients receiving a chemotherapy regimen that included cisplatin (median dose=75 mg/m2). The efficacy of Akynzeo was assessed in 135 patients who received Akynzeo (netupitant 300 mg and palonosetron 0.5 mg) and 136 patients who received oral palonosetron 0.5 mg. The efficacy endpoints were complete response (CR) (defined as no emetic episode and no use of rescue medication) for the 25-120 hour interval (delayed phase), CR for the 0-24 hour interval (acute phase), and CR within 120 hours (overall phase) after the start of the chemotherapy administration.
Complete Response- Delayed Phase: Akynzeo 90.4% and Palonosetron 80.1% (p-0.032)
Complete Response- Acute Phase: Akynzeo 98.5% and Palonosetron 89.7% (p- 0.002)
Complete Response- Overall Phase: Akynzeo 89.6% and Palonosetron 76.5% (p- 0.003)
Trial Two
In a multicenter, randomized, parallel, double-blind, active controlled, superiority trial, the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of Akynzeo was compared with a single oral dose of palonosetron 0.5 mg in cancer patients scheduled to receive the first cycle of an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) regimen for the treatment of a solid malignant tumor. All patients received a single oral dose of dexamethasone. After completion of cycle 1, patients had the option to participate in a multiple-cycle extension, receiving the same treatment as assigned in cycle 1. There was no pre-specified limit of the number of repeat consecutive cycles for any patient. A total of 1455 patients were randomized to the Akynzeo arm or palonosetron arm. A total of 1450 patients (Akynzeo n=725; palonosetron n=725) received study medication: of these, 1438 patients (98.8%) completed cycle 1 and 1286 patients (88.4%) continued treatment in the multiple-cycle extension. A total of 907 patients (62.3%) completed the multiple-cycle extension up to a maximum of eight treatment cycles. The primary efficacy endpoint was the CR rate in the delayed phase, 25-120 hours after the start of chemotherapy administration. Complete response in the Delayed Phase was achieved by 76.9% of the subjects in the Akynzeo arm and 69.5% in the Palonosetron arm (p - 0.001).

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Akynzeo or chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, please visit www.akynzeo.com","Mechanism of Action
Akynzeo is a fixed combination of netupitant and palonosetron. Netupitant is a selective antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. Delayed emesis has been largely associated with the activation of tachykinin family neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors (broadly distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems) by substance P. In in vitro and in vivo studies, netupitant inhibits substance P mediated responses. Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. Chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by stimulating the release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. Serotonin then activates 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. The development of acute emesis is known to depend on serotonin and its 5-HT3 receptors have been demonstrated to selectively stimulate the emetic response.

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Alimta for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer was based on the following data:
Initial Treatment in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy, for patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations
The efficacy of Alimta in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy was investigated in KEYNOTE-189, a randomized, double-blind, phase III study in patients (n=616) with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who received no prior treatment for metastatic disease. The patients were randomized, 2:1, to receive pemetrexed and a platinum-based chemotherapy plus either pembrolizumab (test arm) or placebo (control arm). Patients were stratified based on PD-L1 tumor proportion score (<1 percent or â‰¥ 1 percent), among other factors. After a median follow-up of 10.5 months, median OS was not reached in the test arm, versus 11.3 months in the control arm. Compared with patients in the control arm, those in the test arm were 51 percent less likely to die, and those in the high PD-L1 score group were 58 percent less likely to die. Median PFS was 8.8 months for the pembrolizumab arm, versus 4.9 months for the control arm.
Initial Treatment in combination with cisplatin for patients with locally advanced or metastatic, non-squamous NSCLC
Study JMDB was a multi-center, randomized (1:1), open-label study conducted in 1,725 chemotherapy-naive patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC. Patients were randomized to receive Alimta with cisplatin or gemcitabine with cisplatin. Randomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS 0 versus 1), gender, disease stage, basis for pathological diagnosis (histopathological/cytopathological), history of brain metastases, and investigative center. Alimta was administered intravenously over 10 minutes at a dose of 500mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Cisplatin was administered intravenously at a dose of 75mg/m2 approximately 30 minutes after Alimta administration on Day 1 of each cycle, gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 1250mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 8, and cisplatin was administered intravenously at a dose of 75mg/m2 approximately 30minutes after administration of gemcitabine, on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle. Treatment was administered up to a total of 6 cycles; patients in both arms received folic acid, vitaminB12, and dexamethasone. The primary efficacy outcome measure was overall survival. The median overall survival was 10.3 months for both arms.
As a single agent for the treatment of patients with recurrent, metastatic non-squamous, NSCLC after prior chemotherapy
Study JMEI was a multi-center, randomized (1:1), open-label study conducted in patients (n=571) with Stage III or IV NSCLC that had recurred or progressed following one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease. Patients were randomized to receive Alimta 500mg/m2 intravenously or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour intravenous infusion once every 21 days. Patients randomized to Alimta also received folic acid and vitaminB12. The primary endpoint was reached, with data showing that overall survival with Alimta was non-inferior to docetaxel.
Maintenance Treatment Following First-line Non-ALIMTA Containing Platinum-Based Chemotherapy
The efficacy of Alimta as maintenance therapy following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy was evaluated in Study JMEN, a multicenter, randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 663 patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC who did not progress after four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive Alimta 500 mg/m2 intravenously every 21 days or placebo until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Patients in both study arms received folic acid, vitamin B12, and dexamethasone. The major efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival based on assessment by independent review and overall survival. The median overall survival was 13.4 months in the Alimta arm and 10.6 months in the placebo arm. The median progression free survival was four months for the Alimta arm versus 2.0 months for the placebo arm.
Maintenance Treatment Following First-line ALIMTA Plus Platinum Chemotherapy
The efficacy of Alimta as maintenance therapy following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy was also evaluated in PARAMOUNT, a multi-center, randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in patients with Stage IIIb/IV non-squamous NSCLC who had completed four cycles of Alimta in combination with cisplatin and achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD). Patients were required to have an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Patients were randomized to receive Alimta 500mg/m2 intravenously every 21 days or placebo until disease progression. Randomization was stratified by response to Alimta in combination with cisplatin induction therapy (CR or PR versus SD), disease stage (IIIb versus IV), and ECOG PS(0 versus 1). Patients in both arms received folic acid, vitamin B12, and dexamethasone. The main efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS) and an additional efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). The median overall survival was 13.9 months for the Alimta arm versus 11.0 for the placebo arm. The median progression free survival was 4.1 months versus 2.8 months, respectively.

For additional information regarding Alimta or non-small cell lung cancer, please visit https://www.alimta.com/","Mechanism of Action
Alimta (pemetrexed) is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor that disrupts folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. Invitro studies show that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT),which are folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is taken into cells by membrane carriers such as the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT.

Oncology,Alimta (pemetrexed for injection),"General Information
Alimta (pemetrexed) is a chemotherapy drug that interferes with three folic acid related enzymes that work feed the cancer cell, the process that allows mesothelioma cells to spread.
Alimta is indicated, in combination with cisplatin, for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma whose disease is unresectable or who are otherwise not candidates for curative surgery.
The recommended dosage is 500 mg/m2 administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Alimta was based on a multi-center, randomized, single-blind study enrolling 448 chemonaive subjects with Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM). The study compared survival in subjects treated with Alimta in combination with cisplatin to cisplatin alone. Subjects received Alimta intravenously over 10 minutes at a dose of 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin was administered intravenously over 2 hours at a dose of 75 mg/. Some patients were given folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation.
Results from the trial demonstrated an objective tumor response rate for Alimta plus cisplatin that was greater than the objective tumor response rate for cisplatin alone. Data showed that the median overall survival for subjects treated with Alimta plus cisplatin were 12.1 months compared with 9.3 months with cisplatin alone. Subjects given supplements of folic acid and vitamin B12 showed a 13.3 months median survival rate with the combination treatment compared with 10.0 months with cisplatin alone.

Oncology,Aloxi (palonosetron),"General Information
Aloxi (palonosetron) is an injectable anti-vomiting and anti-nausea agent taken just chemotherapy treatments. Palonosetron belongs to a relatively new, but well-known, class of anti-emetics, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.
Aloxi is indicated for the prevention of acute or delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately and highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.
The recommended dosage of Aloxi is 0.25 mg administered as a single dose approximately 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy. In Europe, the Palonosetron trademark is licensed under the name Onicit. It will be marketed in Italy by Italfarmaco, a privately owned pharmaceutical company.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Aloxi is based on three phase III clinical trials and one phase II study. Complete response rates, defined as no emetic episodes and no rescue medication, and other efficacy parameters were assessed through a total of 120 hours of treatment of chemotherapy and palonosetron injection.
Two-phase III trials tested the efficacy of Aloxi against moderately emetogenic chemotherapy treatment. The multicenter, randomized, double blind studies (called 99-03 and 99-04) enrolled 1,132 subjects and designed to compare the efficacy and safety profile of palonosetron with that of a comparator agent for prevention of CINV. Subjects in the 99-03 study were randomized to receive single intravenous doses of 0.25 mg palonosetron, 0.75 mg palonosetron, or 32 mg ondansetron 30 minutes prior to moderately-emetogenic chemotherapy. In study 99-04, subjects in the comparator arm received 100 mg dolasetron as the comparator agent.
Results showed that the complete response rate for subjects in the 0.25 mg palonosetron arm was significantly greater than the complete response rate among patients who received 32 mg ondansetron. During the first 24 hours following chemotherapy, also called the acute phase, 81.0% of the subjects treated with a single intravenous 0.25 mg dose of palonosetron achieved a complete response, compared to 68.6% of patients treated with 32 mg ondansetron. During the delayed phase, 74.1% of subjects treated with 0.25 mg palonosetron had a complete response compared to 55.1% of patients in the 32 mg ondansetron study arm. Results from study 99-03 were presented in an ASCO Integrated Education Session entitled ""Pathogenesis-Based Treatment of Mucositis and Nausea and Vomiting"". Results from the 99-04 trial were reported in June 2002 at the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) International Symposium.
A third double-blind, phase 3 trial (99-05) enrolled 667 subjects and compared single-dose IV ALOXI with single-dose IV ondansetron (study 3) given 30 minutes prior to highly emetogenic chemotherapy including cisplatin Â¡Ã� 60 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide > 1500 mg/m2, and dacarbazine. Results showed that during the delayed phase 45.3% of subjects treated, with 0.25 mg palonosetron had a complete response compared to 38.9% of subjects in the 32 mg ondansetron trial arm. Additionally, 42.0% of the subjects given dexamethasone prior to chemotherapy and treated with a single intravenous 0.25 mg dose of palonosetron achieved a complete response during the delayed phase, compared to 28.6% of subjects treated with 32 mg ondansetron. Data showed that the median time to first emetic episode for subjects treated with palonosetron was more than 120 hours, compared to 42.7 hours for subjects treated with 32 mg ondansetron.
A double-blind, dose-ranging phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy of single-dose IV palonosetron from 0.3 to 90 Âµg/kg (equivalent to < 0.1 mg to 6 mg fixed dose) in 161 chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve adult cancer patients receiving highly-emetogenic chemotherapy (either cisplatin Â¡Ã� 70 mg/m2 or cyclophosphamide > 1100 mg/m2). Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically. Results indicated that 0.25 mg is the lowest effective dose in preventing acute nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

Ophthalmology,Acuvail (ketorolac tromethamine),"General Information
Acuvail is an advanced, preservative-free formulation of ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It blocks the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, which should be blocked in order to inhibit the development of prostaglandins, the primary sources of pain and inflammation following cataract surgery.
Acuvail is specifically indicated for the treatment of pain and inflammation following cataract surgery.
Acuvail is supplied as a solution for topical administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is one drop applied to the affected eye twice daily beginning 1 day prior to cataract surgery, continued on the day of surgery, and through the first 2 weeks of the postoperative period.
Use with other topical medications
Acuvail solution may be administered in conjunction with other topical ophthalmic medications such as alpha-agonists, beta-blockers, cycloplegics, and mydriatics. Drops should be administered at least 5 minutes apart.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Acuvail was based on two multi-center, randomized, double-masked, parallel group comparison studies involving more than 500 subjects. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as complete clearance of anterior chamber inflammation, measured by summed inflammation score (SOIS) and ocular pain relief following cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Results demonstrated that at day seven, nearly twice as many subjects receiving Acuvail solution had an SOIS score of zero when compared to subjects treated with placebo (32% versus 17%). In addition, Acuvail resulted in a significantly higher incidence of clearing of anterior chamber inflammation at day 14 versus placebo (53% versus 26%). Acuvail was also significantly superior to placebo in resolving ocular pain post-cataract surgery. On day one post-cataract surgery, the percentage of the Acuvail cohort with pain scores of zero was 72%, compared to 40% for the placebo cohort.

The recommended dose is 6 mg (0.05 mL of 120 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection monthly (approximately every 25-31 days) for the first three doses, followed by 6 mg (0.05 mL) by intravitreal injection once every 8-12 weeks.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Beovu was based on the phase 3 HAWK and HARRIER trials. The 96-week prospective, randomized, double-masked multi-center studies were designed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injections of brolucizumab 6 mg (HAWK and HARRIER) and 3 mg (HAWK only) versus aflibercept 2 mg in patients with wet AMD. The trials enrolled over 1,800 patients across nearly 400 centers worldwide. In both trials patients on Beovu achieved vision gains that were non-inferior to Regeneronâ€™s Eylea (aflibercept) at year one with longer treatment intervals in a majority of patients. In both clinical trials, approximately 30% of patients gained at least 15 letters at year one. Beovu showed greater reduction in central subfield thickness (CST) as early as week 16 and at year one, and fewer patients had intra-retinal (IRF) and/or sub-retinal fluid (SRF). Retinal fluid is a key marker of disease activity. In both trials eligible patients could be maintained on a three-month dosing interval immediately after the loading phase. At year one, over half of patients were maintained on the three-month dosing interval (56% in HAWK and 51% in HARRIER).

The recommended initial dose of the drug is one drop into the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) 4 times daily, beginning 24 hours after surgery and continuing throughout the first 2 weeks of the postoperative period. This should be followed by administration 2 times daily for a week and then a taper based on the response.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Durezol was based on the results of two clinical trials. These randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies enrolled 327 subjects with an anterior chamber cell grade of less than or equal to 2 (a cell count of 10 or higher) after cataract surgery. The subjects received one drop of Durezol or placebo, self instilled either 2 (BID) or 4 (QID) times per day for 14 days, beginning the day after surgery. The presence of complete clearing (a cell count of 0) was assessed 8 and 15 days post-surgery using a slit lamp binocular microscope. In the intent-to-treat analyses of both studies, a significant benefit was seen in the QID Durezol-treated group in ocular inflammation and reduction of pain when compared with placebo. The results are as follows: Day Eight Anterior Chamber cell clearing was seen in 22% of the Durezol QID arm compared to 7% in the placebo group and reduction of pain was reported in 58% of the Durezol arm and 27% of the placebo arm (p<0.01 for both endpoints). Day Fifteen Anterior Chamber cell clearing was seen in 41% of the Durezol QID arm compared to 11% of the placebo arm and reduction of pain was reported in 63% of the Durezol arm and 35% of the placebo arm (p<0.01 for both endpoints).

Durezol is a sterile, topical anti-inflammatory corticosteroid for ophthalmic use. Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents that may delay or slow healing. They inhibit edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotreines by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid.

Ophthalmology,Eylea (aflibercept),"General Information
Eylea (aflibercept) is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human . Vascular endothelial growth (VEGF) receptors 1 and 2. VEGF-A is a member of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. Activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in neovascularization and vascular permeability.
Eylea is specifically approved for neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration.
Eylea is supplied as a solution for intravitreal injection. The recommended dose is 2 mg (0.05 mL or 50 microliters) administered by intravitreal injection every four weeks (monthly) for the first 12 weeks (three months), followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (two months).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA Approval of Eylea was based on two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, active-controlled studies, VIEW1 and VIEW2. A total of 2,412 subjects were treated and evaluable for efficacy. The subjects were randomized to one of four dosing regimens: 1) Eylea administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following three initial monthly doses (Eylea 2Q8); 2) Eylea administered 2 mg every four weeks (Eylea 2Q4); 3) Eylea 0.5 mg administered every four weeks (Eylea 0.5Q4); and 4) ranibizumab administered 0.5 mg every four weeks (ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects who maintained vision, defined as losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at week 52 compared to baseline. Both Eylea 2Q8 and 2Q4 groups were shown to have efficacy that was clinically equivalent to the ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4 group. In VIEW1 this endpoint was reached by 94%, 95% and 94% of subjects in the Eylea 2Q8, Eylea 2Q4 and ranibizumab arms, respectively. In VIEW2 this endpoint was reached by 95% of subjects in all three treatment arms.

Ophthalmology,Eylea (aflibercept),"General Information
Eylea (aflibercept) is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor.
Eylea is specifically indicated for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy of all stages, including in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME).
Eylea is supplied as an intravitreal injection. The recommended dosage of Eylea in patients with diabetic retinopathy is 2 milligrams (mg) every two months (8 weeks) after five initial monthly injections. Although Eylea may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks, additional efficacy was not demonstrated when Eylea was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Eylea for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy in DME was based on two year data from the Phase III VISTA-DME and VIVID-DME studies of 862 patients, which compared Eylea 2 mg monthly, Eylea 2 mg every two months (after five initial monthly injections), or macular laser photocoagulation (at baseline and then as needed). In these studies, on the primary endpoint of mean change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at one year, patients treated with Eylea monthly or every two months showed statistically significant improvements compared to the control group. Patients in both Eylea groups gained, on average, the ability to read approximately two additional lines on an eye chart compared with almost no change in the control group.
The FDA approval of Eylea for diabetic retinopathy was based on six-month and one-year results from PANORAMA, a randomized, multi-center, controlled Phase 3 trial that enrolled 402 patients and was designed to investigate Eylea for the improvement of moderately severe to severe NPDR without diabetic macular edema (DME), compared to sham injection. There were three treatment arms â€“ an observational sham injection group and two Eylea treatment groups. Eylea was dosed every eight weeks (following five initial monthly doses) or every 16 weeks (following three initial monthly doses and one eight-week interval). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced a two-step or greater improvement in the diabetic retinopathy severity scale (DRSS) from baseline for the combined Eylea treatment groups at week 24, and for each Eylea treatment group separately (every eight-week group and every 16-week group) at week 52. The DRSS is a systematic grading scale to assess DR severity based on photographs of the retina.

Opioid Use Disorder,Lucemyra (lofexidine),"General Information
Lucemyra (lofexidine) is a central alpha-2 adrenergic agonist.
Lucemyra is specifically indicated for mitigation of opioid withdrawal symptoms to facilitate abrupt opioid discontinuation in adults.
Lucemyra is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The usual starting dosage is three 0.18 mg tablets taken orally 4 times daily during the period of peak withdrawal symptoms (generally the first 5 to 7 days following last use of opioid) with dosing guided by symptoms and side effects. There should be 5 to 6 hours between each dose. The total daily dosage of Lucemyra should not exceed 2.88 mg (16 tablets) and no single dose should exceed 0.72 mg (4 tablets). Lucemyra treatment may be continued for up to 14 days with dosing guided by symptoms. Discontinue Lucemyra with a gradual dose reduction over a 2- to 4-day period to mitigate Lucemyra withdrawal symptoms.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Lucemyra was based on two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.
Study 1
Study 1 was a 2-part efficacy, safety, and dose-response study conducted in the United States in patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence who were physically dependent on short-acting opioids (e.g., heroin, hydrocodone, oxycodone). The first part of the study was an inpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design consisting of 7 days of inpatient treatment (Days 1-7) with Lucemyra 2.16 mg total daily dose (0.54 mg 4 times daily) (n=229), Lucemyra 2.88 mg total daily dose (0.72 mg 4 times daily) (n=222), or matching placebo (n=151). Patients also had access to a variety of support medications for withdrawal symptoms.The second part of the study (Days 8-14) was an open-label design where all patients who successfully completed Days 1-7 were eligible to receive open-label treatment with variable-dose Lucemyra treatment (as determined by the investigator, but not to exceed 2.88 mg total daily dose) for up to an additional 7 days (Days 8-14) in either an inpatient or outpatient setting as determined by the investigator and the patient. No patient received Lucemyra for more than 14 days. The two endpoints to support efficacy were the mean Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale of Gossop (SOWS-Gossop) total score on Days 1 â€“ 7 of treatment and the proportion of patients that completed 7 days of treatment. Of the randomized and treated patients, 28% of placebo patients, 41% of Lucemyra 2.16 mg, and 40% of Lucemyra 2.88 mg patients completed 7 days of treatment. The difference in proportion in both Lucemyra groups was significant compared to placebo. The mean SOWS-Gossop scores for Days 1 â€“ 7 were 8.8, 6.5, and 6.1 for placebo, Lucemyra 2.16 mg and Lucemyra 2.88 mg, respectively, which was also significant.
Study 2
This was an inpatient, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study carried out in the United States in patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence who were physically dependent on short-acting opioids (e.g., heroin, hydrocodone, oxycodone). Patients were treated with Lucemyra tablets (2.88 mg/day [0.72 mg four times daily]) or matching placebo for 5 days (Days 1-5). Patients also had access to a variety of support medications for withdrawal symptoms. All patients then received placebo on Days 6 and 7 and were discharged on Day 8. The two endpoints to support efficacy were the mean SOWS-Gossop total score on Days 1 â€“ 5 of treatment and the proportion of patients that completed 5 days of treatment. The SOWS-Gossop was administered at baseline and once daily 3.5 hours after the first morning dose on Days 1 â€“ 5. A total of 264 patients were randomized into the study. Of the randomized and treated patients, 33% of placebo patients and 49% of Lucemyra patients completed 5 days of treatment. The difference in proportion between the two groups was significant. The mean SOWS-Gossop scores for Days 1 â€“ 5 were 8.9 and 7.0 for placebo and Lucemyra 2.88 mg, respectively, which was statistically significant.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Lucemyra may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Orthopedics/Orthopedic Surgery,Amrix (cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended release),"General Information
Amrix (cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride) is a once daily extended release skeletal muscle relaxant which relieves muscle spasm of local origin without interfering with muscle function. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. However, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride is thought to act primarily at brain stem (and to a lesser extent at spinal cord level) to relieve skeletal muscle spasms of local origin without altering muscle function.
Amris is specifically indicated as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions.
Amrix is supplied as 15mg and 30mg capsules for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is one (1) 15 mg capsule taken once daily. Some patients may require up to 30 mg/day, given as one (1) 30 mg capsule taken once daily or as two (2) 15 mg capsules taken once daily. It is recommended that doses be taken at approximately the same time each day. Use of Amrix for periods longer than two or three weeks is not recommended.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Amrix was based on the results of two identical double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies: Study 1105 evaluated 30 mg of Amrix and Study 1106 studied 15 mg of Amrix both taken once daily for 14 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the patientâ€™s rating of medication helpfulness, measured at Day 4 and Day 14, between the two Amrix arms versus placebo. The primary endpoint was reached with signifcance for both Amrix arms. In addition, one of the two studies demonstrated significant differences between the Amrix 30 mg group and the placebo group in terms of patient-rated relief from local pain due to muscle spasm at Day 4 and Day 8, in subject-rated restriction of movement at Day 4 and Day 8, and in patient-rated global impression of change at Day 4, Day 8, and Day 14.

Orthopedics/Orthopedic Surgery,Prolia (denosumab),"General Information
Prolia (denosumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to and inhibits the receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANK Ligand), the primary mediator of bone resorption. RANK Ligand is the protein responsible for activating osteoclasts, the cells that break down bone. An increased amount of the protein has been linked as the primary cause of a broad range of bone loss conditions including osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, bone erosions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and bone metastases.
Prolia is specifically indicated for the following patients at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture:
â€¢ Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.
â€¢ To increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.
â€¢ Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women at high risk of fracture who are either initiating or continuing systemic glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5mg or greater of prednisone and expected to remain on glucocorticoids for at least 6months.
â€¢ To increase bone mass in men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer.
â€¢ To increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer.
Prolia is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous administration. The recommended initial dose is 60 mg administered as a single subcutaneous injection once every 6 months. Prolia should be administered via subcutaneous injection in the upper arm, the upper thigh, or the abdomen.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Prolia for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was based on a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial enrolled 7,808 women aged 60 to 91 years with a baseline BMD T-score between -2.5 and -4.0 at either the lumbar spine or total hip. Women with other diseases or on therapy that affect bone were excluded. The women were randomized to receive SC injections of either placebo or Prolia 60 mg once every 6 months. All women received at least 1000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of new morphometric (radiologically-diagnosed) vertebral fractures at 3 years. Prolia significantly reduced the incidence of new morphometric vertebral fractures at 1, 2, and 3 years. The incidence of new vertebral fractures at year 3 was 7.2% in the placebo-treated women compared to 2.3% for the Prolia-treated women.
The FDA approval of Prolia to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis was based on a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled men (n=242) had a baseline BMD T-score between -2.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck. Men with a BMD T-score between -1.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck were also enrolled if there was a history of prior fragility fracture. The subjects were randomized to receive SC injections of either placebo (n=121) or Prolia 60mg (n =121) once every 6 months. All men received at least 1000mg calcium and at least 800IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine Bone Mineral Density (BMD) from baseline to 1-year. The treatment differences in BMD at 1-year were 4.8% (+0.9% placebo, +5.7% Prolia; at the lumbar spine, 2.0% (+0.3% placebo, +2.4% Prolia) at the total hip, and 2.2% (0.0% placebo, +2.1% Prolia) at femoral neck.
The FDA approval of Prolia in the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was based on the 12-month primary analysis of a 2-year, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled study of 795 patients (70% women and 30% men) aged 20 to 94 years (mean age of 63 years) treated with greater than or equal to 7.5mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent) for < 3 months prior to study enrollment and planning to continue treatment for a total of at least 6 months (glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation; n = 290) or â‰¥ 3 months prior to study enrollment and planning to continue treatment for a total of at least 6 months (glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation, n = 505). Enrolled patients <50 years of age were required to have a history of osteoporotic fracture. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either an oral daily bisphosphonate (active-control, risedronate 5mg once daily) (n = 397) or Prolia 60mg subcutaneously once every 6 months (n = 398) for one year. Patients received at least 1000mg calcium and 800IU vitamin D supplementation daily. In the glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation, Prolia significantly increased lumbar spine BMD compared to the active-control at one year (Active-control 0.8%, Prolia 3.8%) with a treatment difference of 2.9%. In the glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation, Prolia significantly increased lumbar spine BMD compared to active-control at one year (Active-control 2.3%, Prolia 4.4%) with a treatment difference of 2.2%.
The FDA approval of Prolia in the treatment of bone loss in men with non-metastatic prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was based on a 3-year, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national study conducted in 1,468 men. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -0.4, and 22% of men had a vertebral fracture at baseline. Men were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (n=734) or Prolia 60mg (n=734) once every 6 months for a total of 6 doses. Randomization was stratified by age (<70 years vs. â‰¥70 years) and duration of ADT at trial entry (â‰¤6 months vs. >6 months). Seventy-nine percent of patients received ADT for more than 6months at study entry. All men received at least 1000mg calcium and 400IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to month 24. Lumbar spine BMD was higher at 2 years in Prolia-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients [-1.0% placebo, +5.6% Prolia; treatment difference 6.7%].
The FDA approval of Prolia for the treatment of bone loss in women receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy for breast cancer was based on a 2-year, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study. Women (n=252) had baseline BMD T-scores between -1.0 to-2.5 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck, and had not experienced fracture after age 25. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -1.1,and 2.0% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline. Women were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (n=125) or Prolia 60mg (n=127) once every 6 months for a total of 4 doses. Randomization was stratified by duration of adjuvant AI therapy at trial entry (â‰¤6months vs. >6months). Sixty-two percent of patients received adjuvant AI therapy for more than 6 months at study entry. All women received at least 1000mg calcium and 400IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to month 12. Lumbar spine BMD was higher at 12 months in Prolia-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients [-0.7% placebo, +4.8% Prolia; treatment difference 5.5%].

Prolia (denosumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to RANKL, a transmembrane or soluble protein essential for the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. Prolia prevents RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone.

Orthopedics/Orthopedic Surgery,Rayos (prednisone) delayed-release tablets,"General Information
Rayos is an orally active modified-release formulation of prednisone, a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are primarily used for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems and they modify the bodyâ€™s immune responses to diverse stimuli.
Rayos is specifically indicated for certain allergic, dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hematologic, ophthalmologic, nervous system, renal, respiratory, rheumatologic, specific infectious diseases or conditions and organ transplantation.
Rayos is supplied as a delayed release tablet for oral administration. The dose of Rayos should be individualized according to the severity of the disease and the response of the patient. The initial dosage of Rayos may vary from 5 to 60 mg per day depending on the specific disease. Rayos should be taken daily with food.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Rayos was based in part on one multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 12-week trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This trial enrolled 350 adults not currently treated with corticosteroids but had received non-biologic DMARD therapy for at least 6 months and had an incomplete response to DMARD therapy alone. The subjects were randomized to Rayos 5 mg or placebo administered at 10 pm. The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects with improvement in rheumatoid arthritis at 12 weeks using ACR response criteria (ACR20). In the Rayos arm, 47% of subjects reached ACR20 versus 29% in the placebo arm. In addition, subjects treated with Rayos had a median decrease in the duration of morning stiffness of 55 minutes compared to 33 minutes in the placebo arm.

Orthopedics/Orthopedic Surgery,Strensiq (asfotase alfa),"General Information
Strensiq (asfotase alfa) is a tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase.
Strensiq is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with perinatal/infantile- and juvenile-onset hypophosphatasia.
Strensiq is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous administration. The recommended dosing is as follows:
Perinatal/Infantile-Onset HPP
Recommended dosage regimen is 2 mg/kg administered subcutaneously three times per week, or 1 mg/kg administered six times per week. Injection site reactions may limit the tolerability of the six times per week regimen. The dose may be increased to 3 mg/kg three times per week for insufficient efficacy.
Juvenile-Onset HPP
Recommended dosage regimen is 2 mg/kg administered subcutaneously three times per week, or 1 mg/kg administered six times per week. Injection site reactions may limit the tolerability of the six times per week regimen.
Preparation and Weight-Based Dosing
Caution: Do not use the 80 mg/0.8 mL vial in pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg because the systemic asfotase alfa exposure achieved with the 80 mg/0.8 mL vial (higher concentration) is lower than that achieved with the other strength vials (lower concentration). A lower exposure may not be adequate for this subgroup of patients. â€¢ See full prescribing information for tables of weight-based dosing by treatment regimen.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Strensiq was based on four prospective, open-label studies in 99 patients with perinatal, infantile- or juvenile-onset HPP who received treatment for up to 6.5 years during Study results showed that patients with perinatal- and infantile-onset HPP treated with Strensiq had improved overall survival and survival without the need for a ventilator (ventilator-free survival). Ninety-seven percent of treated patients were alive at one year of age compared to 42 percent of control patients selected from a natural history study group. Similarly, the ventilator-free survival rate at one year of age was 85 percent for treated patients compared to less than 50 percent for the natural history control patients. Patients with juvenile-onset HPP treated with Strensiq showed improvements in growth and bone health compared to control patients selected from a natural history database. All treated patients had improvement in low weight or short stature or maintained normal height and weight. In comparison, approximately 20 percent of control patients had growth delays over time, with shifts in height or weight from the normal range for children their age to heights and weights well below normal for age. Juvenile-onset patients also showed improvements in bone mineralization, as measured on a scale that evaluates the severity of rickets and other HPP-related skeletal abnormalities based on x-ray images. All treated patients demonstrated substantial healing of rickets on x-rays while some natural history control patients showed increasing signs of rickets over time.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Strensiq may include, but are not limited to, the following:
injection site reactions
lipodystrophy
ectopic calcifications
hypersensitivity reactions
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Strensiq or hypophosphatasia, please visit http://strensiq.com/","Mechanism of Action
Hypophosphatasia is caused by a deficiency in the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) enzyme, which leads to elevations in several TNSALP substrates, including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). Elevated extracellular levels of PPi block hydroxyapatite crystal growth which inhibits bone mineralization and causes an accumulation of unmineralized bone matrix which manifests as rickets and bone deformation in infants and children and as osteomalacia (softening of bones) once growth plates close, along with muscle weakness. Replacement of the TNSALP enzyme upon Strensiq treatment reduces the enzyme substrate levels.

Xgeva (denosumab) is a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds to human RANKL. Increased osteoclast activity, stimulated by RANKL, is a mediator of bone pathology in solid tumors with osseous metastases.
Xgeva is specifically indicated for the treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumor of bone that is unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity.
The recommended dose for giant cell tumor of the bone is 120 mg administered every 4 weeks with additional 120 mg doses on Days 8 and 15 of the first month of therapy. Administer subcutaneously in the upper arm, upper thigh, or abdomen.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xgeva for giant cell tumor of bone was based on two open-label trials (Trial 4 and 5). Subjects received 120 mg Xgeva subcutaneously every 4 weeks with additional doses on Days 8 and 15 of the first cycle of therapy. Trial 4 was a single arm, pharmacodynamic, and proof of concept trial conducted in 37 adult patients with unresectable or recurrent giant cell tumor of bone.Trial 5 was a parallel-cohort, proof of concept, and safety trial conducted in 282 adult or skeletally mature adolescent patients with histologically confirmed giant cell tumor of bone and evidence of measurable active disease. Trial 5 enrolled 10 patients who were 13 to 17 years of age. Patients enrolled into one of three cohorts: Cohort 1 enrolled 170 patients with surgically unsalvageable disease; Cohort 2 enrolled 101 patients with surgically salvageable disease where the investigator determined that the planned surgery was likely to result in severe morbidity; Cohort 3 enrolled 11 patients who previously participated in Trial 4. An independent review committee evaluated objective response in 187 patients enrolled and treated in Trials 4 and 5 for whom baseline and at least one post-baseline radiographic assessment were available.

Osteoarthritis,Duexis (ibuprofen and famotidine),"General Information
Duexis is a proprietary formulation of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen, combined with the potent H2 receptor antagonist famotidine, in a single pill. It was formulated to provide pain relief while reducing stomach acidity during the peak time of risk for ulceration.
Duexis is specifically indicated for the relief of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and to decrease the risk of developing upper gastrointestinal ulcers in patients who are taking ibuprofen for those indications.
Duexis is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is 800 mg/26.6 mg ((ibuprofen/famotidine) as a single tablet administered orally three times per day. The tablets should be swallowed whole, and should not be cut to supply a lower dose.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Duexis was based on two multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled, randomized, 24-week studies (Studies 301 and 303). A total of 1533 subjects were enrolled; all subjects were expected to require daily administration of an NSAID for at least the coming six months for conditions such as the following: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic low back pain, chronic regional pain syndrome, and chronic soft tissue pain. The subjects received either Duexis or ibuprofen (800 mg) three times a day for 24 consecutive weeks. In both trials, Duexis was associated with a statistically significantly reduction in the risk of developing upper gastrointestinal ulcers compared to taking ibuprofen only during the six month study period. Two analyses for each endpoint were conducted. In analysis one, patients who terminated early, without an endoscopic evaluation within 14 days of their last dose of study drug, were classified as not having an ulcer. In analysis two, those patients were classified as having an ulcer. Efficacy was based on the overall incidence rates of subjects who developed at least one upper gastrointestinal ulcer (primary endpoint) or gastric ulcer (secondary endpoint). The results are as follows:
Study 301
Primary endpoint: Analysis 1: Duexis- 10.5% vs. Ibuprofen - 20.0% (p0.002); Analysis 2: Duexis- 22.9% vs. Ibuprofen 32.1% (p0.020). Secondary endpoint: Analysis 1: Duexis- 9.7% vs. Ibuprofen - 17.9% (0.005); Analysis 2: Duexis- 22.4% vs. Ibuprofen 30.0% (p0.052).

Naprelan (naproxen sodium) is the once-a-day formulation of the arthritis medication Naprosyn (naproxen). Naprelan, a sodium salt formulation of Naprosyn, provides for more rapid absorption.
Naprelan tablets use a proprietary delivery system, IPDAS (Intestinal Protective Drug Absorption System), a matrix of naproxen sodium with immediate and controlled release components. Upon ingestion, and after rapid disintegration of the tablet matrix, an initial fraction (approximately 30%) of the medication is released for rapid systemic absorption achieving onset of analgesic action within 30 minutes. In addition, a sustained-release component of microparticles provide an extended absorption phase that both minimizes local gastrointestinal concentrations and prolongs therapeutic systemic levels of the drug, enabling 24-hour duration of action and once-a-day dosing (2-4).
","Side Effects
The most frequent complaints relate to the gastrointestinal tract. In subjects treated chronically with Naprelan, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, serious gastrointestinal toxicity such as perforation, ulceration, and bleeding can occur.

The bodyâ€™s own hyaluronan acts like a lubricant and a shock absorber in the joint and is needed for the joint to work properly. In osteoarthritis there may not be enough hyaluronan, and there may be a decrease in the quality of the hyaluronan in the joint.
Synvisc is specifically indicated for the treatment of pain in osteoarthritis of the knee in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative nonpharmacologic therapy and simple analgesics.
Synvisc is supplied as a gel for intra-articular injection. The recommended initial dose of the drug is an intra-articular injection once a week (one week apart) for a total of three injections.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Synvisc was based on the results of three clinical studies.
Study One This multicenter, randomized, double-blind prospective clinical trial enrolled 103 subjects at four sites in Germany. The study compared the safety and effectiveness of three weekly intra-articular injections of Synvisc and of physiological saline over a 26-week period. A significantly greater number of saline-treated patients took concurrent osteoarthritis medications than did patients treated with Synvisc. While both the Synvisc and the saline-treated groups improved significantly as compared to baseline in all effectiveness measures, the Synvisc group showed a significantly greater improvement in all outcome measures than did the saline-treated group.
Study Two This controlled, randomized, double-blind prospective clinical trial enrolled 29 subjects at a single center in Germany. The subjects received three weekly intra-articular injections of Synvisc or physiological saline and compared for safety and effectiveness over a 26-week period. The results of the study were similar to those in the German multicenter study, except that the significance levels in most comparisons were smaller. In both of these studies the most pain relief and the greatest amount of treatment success occurred 8 to 12 weeks after Synvisc treatment began.
Study Three This prospective, concurrently controlled, randomized, double-blind multicenter study enrolled 90 subjects at five U.S. sites. The study compared the safety and effectiveness of three weekly intra-articular injections of Synvisc and of three weekly arthrocenteses in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee over a four-week period after the first injection or arthrocentesis. Both the Synvisc-treated and the arthrocentesis-treated groups improved significantly as compared to baseline in all effectiveness measures. However, there were no significant differences between the Synvisc-treated and arthrocentesis-treated patients at any time during the four-week evaIuation period.

Osteoporosis,Boniva (ibandronate),"General Information
Boniva (ibandronate sodium) is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. In osteoporosis, where osteoclasts break down bone too quickly, inhibition of this pathway has been shown to slow bone turnover, leading to not only an attenuation of turnover but also a mean increase in bone mass.
Boniva is specifically indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The recommended dose of Boniva is 2.5 mg (oral tablet) once daily.
Boniva is approved as a once-daily oral tablet, with a recommended dosage of 2.5 mg.
Update: In March 2005, Boniva received approval in a new formulation, as a once-monthly oral tablet, with a recommended dosage of 150 mg on the same date each month. This approval made Boniva the first ever once-monthly oral treatment for any chronic disease.
Clinical Results
Treatment Study
FDA approval of Boniva for the treatment of osteoporosis was based on a three-year, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multinational pivotal phase III trial, called BONE. The study enrolled 2,946 post-menopausal women between age 55 and 80 years with osteoporosis. Subjects were treated with either placebo or one of two oral ibandronate schedules: daily (2.5 mg) or intermittent (20 mg) taken every other day for 24 days followed by a between-dose interval of greater than two months. All participants received daily oral calcium (500 mg) and vitamin D (400 IU) supplementation. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of new radiographically diagnosed fractured of the vertebrae after 3 years of treatment.
Results showed that 2.5mg daily of ibandronate reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures by 62% compared with placebo. In addition, data demonstrated an intermittent (20mg) dose of oral ibandronate taken every other day for 24 days reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures by 50% compared with placebo. The cumulative incidence of vertebral fractures in the placebo group was 9.6% over three years, 4.7% in the 2.5mg daily group and 4.9% in the 20mg intermittent group. In the study, ibandronate demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile, with the most commonly reported adverse events being upper respiratory tract infection, back pain, arthralgia, dyspepsia and bronchitis. The percentage of subjects who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was approximately 18% in each of the three groups.
Prevention Study FDA approval of Boniva for the prevention of osteoporosis was based on a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, two year trial. The study enrolled 653 postmenopausal women aged 41 to 82 years of age without osteoporosis. Subjects were given Boniva at .5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.5 mg or placebo. All subjects were given 500 mg of supplemental calcium daily. The primary endpoint was the change in bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine after two years of treatment.
Results showed that treatment with 2.5 mg daily of Boniva achieved a mean increase in lumbar spine BMD of 3.1% compared with placebo after two years of treatment. Data also showed that Boniva (2.5 mg daily) achieved an increase in hip BMD by 1.8%, the femoral neck by 2.0% and the trochanter by 2.1%.
Update: Once-Monthly Dosing Study
Approval of the once-monthly dosing formulation was based on a 12-month, double-blind, placebo controlled noninferiority study which compared the safety and efficacy of the 150 mg once-monthly dose of Boniva to the approved 2.5 mg once-daily dose. The trial enrolled 1602 postmenopausal women with low BMD due to confirmed osteoporosis, who were randomized to receive one of the two regimens. Primary efficacy data indicated that the once-monthly dose produced a mean increase in BMD of 4.85%, vs. an increase of 3.86% for the daily dose. This 0.99% relative increase exceeded the non-inferiority endpoint, establishing the once-monthly regimen's statistical superiority in improving BMD (p=0.002).
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Boniva may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Dyspepsia
Diarrhea
Tooth Disorder
Vomiting
Gastritis
Allergic Reaction
Infection
Update: Results from a 1 year trial comparing the safety of once monthly Boniva to the approved daily regimen produced similar tolerability profiles. Serious events occurred in 7.1% or subjects in the once-monthly group, compared to 4.8% in the daily group. Overall adverse events which may occur more often with once-monthly dosing vs. once daily include, but are not limited to, the following:
Constipation
Influenza-like Illness
Pain in the extremities
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Boniva or osteoporosis, please visit the Boniva web page.","Mechanism of Action
Boniva has a high binding affinity for hydroxypatite, a calcium compound which is part of the mineral matrix of bone. Binding to the site allows the drug to be taken up by mature osteoclasts during the resorption process, and it appear to act intracellularly as an isoprenoid diphosphate lipid analogue, disrupting the farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signaling proteins and potentiating selective osteoclast apoptosis.

Osteoporosis,Duavee (conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene),"General Information
Duavee pairs conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene. Bazedoxifene (TSE-424) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) designed to mimic the beneficial qualities of estrogens, while blocking estrogen in tissues where it can be harmful. The pairing of conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene produces a composite effect that is specific to each target tissue.
Duavee is specifically indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
Duavee is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is one tablet once a day.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Duavee was based on the following clinical trials:
Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms Associated with Menopause
A double blind, randomized placebo controlled trial enrolled 318 women ages 42 to 64 with at least 7 moderate to severe hot flashes per day or 50 per week at baseline. Duavee significantly reduced the number and severity of moderate to severe hot flushes, as measured by the daily severity score, compared with placebo at Weeks 4 and 12.
Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Two studies were conducted: Study 1 and 2. Study 1 was a 24-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of multiple combinations of conjugated estrogen/bazedoxifene (including conjugated estrogens 0.45 mg/bazedoxifene 20 mg) compared to placebo. A total of 3,397 women were enrolled. Duavee significantly increased lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at 24 months compared to placebo. Duavee also significantly increased total hip BMD. The treatment difference (or difference from placebo) in total hip BMD at 24 months was 1.96% (Duavee minus placebo) in women who had been postmenopausal between 1 and 5 years and 1.73% (Duavee minus placebo) in women who had been postmenopausal for more than 5 years. Study 2 was a 12-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled study. Duavee significantly increased mean lumbar spine BMD (treatment difference, 1.51%), at 12 months compared to placebo in women who had been postmenopausal between 1 and 5 years. Treatment with Duavee also increased total hip BMD. The treatment difference in total hip BMD at 12 months was 1.21%. The effect of Duavee on endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial malignancy were also assessed in Study 1 and Study 2. By endometrial biopsy, the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy for Duavee was below 1% in both studies.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Duavee may include, but are not limited to, the following:
muscle spasms
nausea
diarrhea
dyspepsia
abdominal pain
oropharyngeal pain
dizziness
neck pain
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Duavee or vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, please visit the Duavee web page.","Mechanism of Action
Duavee pairs conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene. Conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene function by binding to and activating estrogen receptors (ER) a and ÃŸ, which vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Conjugated estrogens are composed of multiple estrogens and are agonists of ER- a and ÃŸ. Bazedoxifene is an estrogen agonist/antagonist that acts as an agonist in some estrogen-sensitive tissues and an antagonist in others. The pairing of conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene produces a composite effect that is specific to each target tissue. The bazedoxifene component reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia that can occur with the conjugated estrogens component.

Osteoporosis,Evenity (romosozumab-aqqg),"General Information
Evenity (romosozumab-aqqg) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG2) and inhibits sclerostin, a glycoprotein secreted by osteocytes that has anti-anabolic effects on bone.
Evenity is specifically indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.
Evenity is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous administration.
The anabolic effect of Evenity wanes after 12 monthly doses of therapy. Therefore, the duration of Evenity use should be limited to 12 monthly doses. If osteoporosis therapy remains warranted, continued therapy with an anti-resorptive agent should be considered.
Two separate syringes (and two separate subcutaneous injections) are needed to administer the total dose of 210 mg of Evenity. Inject two 105 mg/1.17 mL prefilled syringes, one after the other. Evenity should be administered by a healthcare provider.
The recommended dose of Evenity is 210 mg administered subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. Administer once every month. The treatment duration for Evenity is 12 monthly doses. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D during treatment with Evenity. If a dose is missed, administer as soon as it can be rescheduled. Thereafter, Evenity can be scheduled every month from the date of the last dose.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Evenity was based on two phase III trial, FRAME and ARCH.
FRAME (Fracture study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 7,180 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The study evaluated the efficacy of Evenity treatment (210 mg administered monthly), compared with placebo, in reducing the incidence of new vertebral fractures through 12 months. The study also evaluated the efficacy of treating with Evenity for 12 months followed by denosumab for 12 months, compared with placebo followed by denosumab, in reducing the incidence of new vertebral fractures through 24 months. Treatment with Evenity resulted in a significant reduction of new vertebral (spine) fracture at 12 months compared to placebo. This significant reduction in fracture risk persisted through the second year in women who received Evenity during the first year and transitioned to denosumab compared to those who transitioned from placebo to denosumab. In addition, Evenity significantly increased bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck compared to placebo at 12 months. Following the transition from Evenity to denosumab at month 12, BMD continued to increase through month 24.
ARCH (Active-controlled fracture study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture) was a randomized, double-blind, alendronate-controlled study of Evenity in 4,093 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and previous fracture history. This event-driven study evaluated 12 months of Evenity treatment (210 mg administered monthly) followed by at least 12 months of alendronate treatment (70 mg), compared with alendronate treatment alone, to assess its efficacy in reducing the risk of clinical fracture (non-vertebral fracture and symptomatic vertebral fracture) through the primary analysis period and the incidence of new vertebral fracture at 24 months. Treatment with Evenity for 12 months followed by 12 months of alendronate significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fracture at 24 months. Evenity followed by alendronate significantly reduced the risk of clinical fracture (defined as a composite of symptomatic vertebral fracture and nonvertebral fracture) after a median follow-up of 33 months. Evenity significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck at 12 months compared to alendronate. Twelve months of treatment with Evenity followed by 12 months of treatment with alendronate significantly increased BMD compared with alendronate alone.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Evenity may include, but are not limited to, the following:
arthralgia
headache
The Evenity drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning: Evenity may increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. Evenity should not be initiated in patients who have had a myocardial infarction or stroke within the preceding year. Consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. If a patient experiences a myocardial infarction or stroke during therapy, Evenity should be discontinued.

Osteoporosis,Evista (raloxifene hydrochloride),"General Information
Evista (raloxifene hydrochloride) is an estrogen agonist/antagonist, referred to as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and belongs to the benzothiophene class of compounds. The biological actions of raloxifene are largely mediated through binding to estrogen receptors. This binding results in activation of estrogenic pathways in some tissues (agonism) and and the blockade of estrogenic pathways in other tissues (antagonism).
Evista is specifically approved for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, the reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and the reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at high risk of invasive breast cancer. Evista is supplied as a 60 mg tablet designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is one 60 mg tablet daily, which may be administered any time of day without regard to meals.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Evista was based on the results of several clinical trials.
Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Effect on Fracture Incidence
This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational trial enrolled 7,705 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. In the subjects with no baseline fractures, the percentage with one or more than one new vertebral fracture after three years was 1.9% in the Evista arm versus 4.3% in the placebo arm. In the subjects with one or more than one baseline fracture, the percentage of those with one or more than one additional fracture after three years was 14.1% in the Evista arm versus 20.2% in the placebo arm. In all randomized subjects the percentage with one or more than one new clinical (painful) vertebral fracture after three years was 1.8% in the Evista arm versus 3.1% in the placebo arm.
Effect on Bone Mineral Density
All women in this study received Evista (60 mg/day) in addition to calcium (500 mg/day) and vitamin D (400 to 600 IU/day). Treatment with Evista increased spine and hip BMD by 2 to 3%. It also decreased the incidence of the first vertebral fracture from 4.3% for placebo to 1.9% for Evista (relative risk reduction = 55%) and subsequent vertebral fractures from 20.2% for placebo to 14.1% for Evista (relative risk reduction = 30%). The increases in BMD for Lumbar Spine were as follows: 2.0 (12 months) 2.6 (24 months) and 2.6 (36 months); and for Femoral Neck were 1.3 (12 months), 1.9 (24 months) and 2.1 (36 months).
Bone Histology
Bone biopsies for qualitative and quantitative histomorphometry were obtained at baseline and after 2 years of treatment. Of 56 evaluable biopsies, there were statistically significant decreases in bone formation rate per tissue volume, consistent with a reduction in bone turnover. Normal bone quality was maintained, including no evidence of osteomalacia, marrow fibrosis, cellular toxicity, or woven bone.
Effect on Endometrium
Endometrial thickness was evaluated annually in a subset of the study population (1781 subjects) for 3 years. Placebo-treated women had a 0.27 mm mean decrease from baseline in endometrial thickness over 3 years, whereas the Evista-treated women had a 0.06 mm mean increase.
Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Three randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind osteoporosis prevention trials were conducted: a North American trial that enrolled 544 women; a European trial that enrolled 601 women; and an international trial that enrolled 619 women who had undergone hysterectomy. All the subjects received placebo or Evista (60 mg/day) both in combination with calcium supplementation (400 to 600 mg/day).
Effect on Bone Mineral Density
When compared to placebo the increases in BMD for each of the three studies were statistically significant at 12 months and were maintained at 24 months (p=0.001). This included BMD increases in total hip, femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter and lumbar spine. Evista also increased BMD compared with placebo in the total body by 1.3% to 2.0% and in Wardâ€™s Triangle (hip) by 3.1% to 4.0%.
Effect on Endometrium
Endometrial thickness was evaluated from 831 women in all dose groups every 6 months for 24 months. Placebo-treated women had a 0.04 mm mean increase from baseline in endometrial thickness over 2 years, whereas the Evista treated women had a 0.09 mm mean increase.
Reduction in Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis
MORE Trial
This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational trial evaluated the effect of Evista (60 mg/day) on the incidence of breast cancer as a secondary safety endpoint. After four years, Evista reduced the incidence of all breast cancers by 62%, compared with placebo (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.22-0.67). Evista also reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 71%, compared with placebo (ARR 3.1 per 1000 women-years); this was primarily due to an 80% reduction in the incidence of ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the Evista group compared with placebo.
CORE Trial
The effect of Evista on the incidence of invasive breast cancer was evaluated for 4 additional years in a follow-up study conducted in a subset of postmenopausal women originally enrolled in the MORE trial. The women were not re-randomized and thus continued on the 60 mg/day Evista therapy. Evista reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 56%, compared with placebo (ARR 3.0 per 1000 women-years); this was primarily due to a 63% reduction in the incidence of ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the Evista group compared with placebo. There was no reduction in the incidence of ER-negative breast cancer. In a subset of postmenopausal women followed for up to 8 years from randomization in MORE to the end of CORE, Evista (60 mg/day) reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 60% in women assigned Evista compared with placebo (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21, 0.77; ARR 1.95 per 1000 women-years); this was primarily due to a 65% reduction in the incidence of ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the Evista group compared with placebo.
RUTH Trial
This randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, multinational study enrolled 10,101 postmenopausal women at increased risk of coronary events. The women were followed for a median of 5.6 years after treatment. Evista (60 mg/day) reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 44% compared with placebo [absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2 per 1000 women-years]; this was primarily due to a 55% reduction in ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the Evista group compared with placebo (ARR 1.2 per 1000 women-years). There was no reduction in ER-negative invasive breast cancer.
Reduction in Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women at High Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer
STAR Trial
This randomized, double-blind trial enrolled 19,747 postmenopausal women in North America. The trial was designed to compare the effects of Evista (60 mg/day) versus tamoxifen (20 mg/day) over 5 years on reducing the incidence of invasive breast cancer. Evista was not superior to tamoxifen in reducing the incidence of invasive breast cancer. The observed incidence rates of invasive breast cancer were Evista 4.4 and tamoxifen 4.3 per 1000 women per year.
Effects on Cardiovascular Disease
In the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational trial, dubbed RUTH, 10,101 postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events, received Evista 60 mg/day. They were observed for a median follow-up of 5.6 years. No cardiovascular benefit was demonstrated after treatment with Evista and no significant increase or decrease was observed for coronary events. An increased risk of death due to stroke after treatment with Evista was observed: 59 (1.2%) Evista-treated women died due to a stroke compared to 39 (0.8%) placebo-treated women (2.2 versus 1.5 per 1000 women-years; hazard ratio 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.24; p=0.0499).

Osteoporosis,Evista (raloxifene hydrochloride),"General Information
Evista (raloxifene hydrochloride, 60 mg) has been approved for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Evista, the first in a class of new drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) to be approved by the FDA for marketing for the prevention of osteoporosis, is being studied for its selective ability to act like estrogen in some tissues but not in others.
Clinical Results
The FDA reviewed data from 50 studies conducted in 28 countries to establish the safety and efficacy of Evista for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. More than 12,000 women have participated in the clinical program to date.
A total of 1,764 postmenopausal women participated in pivotal phase III osteoporosis prevention studies. In two studies, women were randomly assigned to take Evista or placebo. In the third study, women took Evista, placebo, or estrogen replacement therapy. All the women took calcium supplements. In each study, Evista was superior when compared with placebo in preventing bone loss in the lumbar spine and hip. These pivotal clinical trials also showed that Evista builds bone, although to a lesser extent than estrogen.
","Side Effects
As with most drugs, Evista was associated with some side effects, the majority of which were reported as mild. A rare but serious side effect associated with Evista was an increase in venous thromboembolic events. The most-commonly observed side effect was hot flashes. Women taking Evista also reported a higher rate of leg cramps than women taking placebo. The leg cramps, generally reported as mild, did not cause women to discontinue Evista therapy.",,

Osteoporosis,Femhrt Tablets,"General Information
femhrt 1/5 is a combination of an estrogen hormone, ethinyl estradiol, and a progestin hormone, norethindrone acetate. It should be used to relieve symptoms associated with menopause, and also for the prevention of osteoporosis.
For the treatment of menopausal symptoms:
Femhrt 1/5 will replace the dropping levels of estrogen in women experiencing menopause. The treatment will reduce moderate to severe symptoms, such as hot flashes or feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest. Femhrt should be taken to relieve these symptoms only as long as the symptoms persist, especially if patient is taking hormones for other reasons.
For the prevention of osteoporosisFemhrt is most effective in the prevention of osteoporosis (the thinning of the bones) when taken as part of an osteoporosis-prevention regimen, including exercise and calcium supplements.
Clinical Results
Although the full clinical trial profile was not available by the FDA, a study on 18 post-menopausal women tested the effects of the femhrt hormone replacement therapy in an altered dose (1mg NA/10mcg EE). Results indicated that the hormones were rapidly absorbed, with the highest plasma concentrations of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol occurring at 1 to 2 hours postdose. The 1/10 dose were generally found to be proportional to the marketed 1/5 dose.
","Side Effects
Taking estrogen-containing drugs increases the risk of cancer of the uterus, and may, under some conditions, increase the risk of breast cancer. Although the risk is not as severe when progestins accompany the estrogen (as in the femhrt 1/5 combination), patients taking femhrt should get regular check-ups and perform regular breast self-examinations. Gallbladder disease, blood clotting, and vaginal bleeding are all also possible serious side-effects to the hormone treatment.
Additional side-effects reported by women taking the estrogen hormone include:
nausea and vomiting, breast tenderness or enlargement, headache, retention of extra fluid (edema), runny nose, abdominal pain, enlargement of non-cancerous tumors (fibroids) of the uterus, skin rashes and other skin abnormalities.
","Additional Information
Visit the following web sites for more information about the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and related subjects:
www.pslgroup.com/MENOPAUSE.HTM","Mechanism of Action
After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulphate conjugated form, estrone sulphate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. The pharmacologic effects of ethinyl estradiol are similar to those of endognous estrogens. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogen replacement therapy acts to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.
Progestin compounds enhance cellular differentiation and generally oppose the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels, increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites, or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen. (FDA Label)

Osteoporosis,Forteo (teriparatide),"General Information
Forteo is a synthetic form of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is naturally found in the body. The synthetic hormone is to be given by subcutaneous injection for the treatment of osteoporosis in men and post-menopausal women who are at high risk for a fracture.
Forteo is supplied in a disposable pen device that can be used for up to 28 days to give once-daily self-administered injections. Forteo is available in a 20 microgram (mcg) dose and should be taken for a period of up to 24 months.
Clinical Results
The FDA's approval of Forteo was based on 24 clinical trials enrolling more than 2,800 postmenopausal women and men with osteoporosis. Phase III clinical trial data showed that Forteo stimulated new bone formation, lowered the risk of vertebral (spinal) fractures and increased bone mineral density (BMD) compared with placebo in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis during an average of 19 months of treatment. The data also showed that Forteo reduced the relative risk of spinal fractures by 65 percent (9.3 % absolute risk reduction), compared with placebo, and lowered the relative risk of nonspinal fractures overall (sites such as the wrist, ribs, hip, ankle/foot, etc.) by 53% (2.9% absolute risk reduction), compared with placebo.
In addition, Forteo also significantly increased spine BMD in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis beginning at three months of treatment. The data showed that 96% of women had an increase from baseline, with 72 percent achieving at least a 5 percent increase in spine BMD and 44% gaining 10 percent or more compared with placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Forteo (teriparatide) may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Pain
Headache
Asthenia
Neck pain
Hypertension
Angina pectoris
Syncope
Nausea
Constipation
Dizziness
Depression
Insomnia
Vertigo
","Additional Information
For additional information on Forteo (teriparatide), please contact The Eli Lilly and Company Web Site","Mechanism of Action
Forteo [teriparatide (rDNA origin) injection] contains recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1-34), [rhPTH(1-34)], which has an identical sequence to the 34 N-terminal amino acids (the biologically active region) of the 84-amino acid human parathyroid hormone. Studies have shown that PTH acts on bone building cells called osteoblasts to stimulate new bone growth and improve bone density. Unlike agents already in use that prevent further bone loss (such as estrogen and bisphosphonate), synthetic PTH may have the potential to replace depleted bone stores.

Osteoporosis,Fosamax (alendronate sodium),"General Information
Fosamax reduces the activity of the cells that cause bone loss and helps build healthy bone. It is the first nonhormonal medicine for women after menopause who have osteoporosis.
The FDA also cleared Fosamax for the treatment of Paget's disease of bone, a chronic disorder that affects up to 1.3 million Americans and may result in enlarged and deformed bones in one or more regions of the skeleton.
Clinical Results
The FDA clearance of Fosamax to treat osteoporosis is based on efficacy data from five clinical trials involving 1,827 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in 16 countries who were followed for at least two years.
In clinical trials, Fosamax significantly increased bone mineral density (closely related to bone strength) at the spine (8.2%), hip (7.2%), and other sites. While the studies were not designed to detect fracture risk, further analysis supports that Fosamax reduced the number of women with new spinal fractures by nearly half (48%), reduced the total number of new spinal fractures by 63%, and reduced overall height loss by 35%. Women treated with Fosamax lost an average of 3 mm in height, compared with women on placebo who lost an average of 4.6 mm in height.
","Side Effects
Side effects observed in clinical trials were generally mild. The most commonly reported drug-related side effects in subjects taking Fosamax were abdominal and musculoskeletal pain. Less frequently reported were other digestive disturbances such as nausea, heartburn, and irritation or pain of the esophagus.
","Additional Information
Fosamax is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Osteoporosis is a progressive disease of the skeleton caused by an imbalance in the body's bone-rebuilding cycle. Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass, which results in bones that are prone to fracture, or by the presence or history of an osteoporotic fracture. Bone mass is closely related to bone strength; the greater the bone mass, the stronger the bones and the less likely they are to fracture.
Osteoporosis affects more than 25 million Americans, 80 percent of them women. Each year, osteoporosis causes more than 1.3 million fractures, including 500,000 spinal fractures, 250,000 hip fractures, and 240,000 wrist fractures.
Bone is constantly being rebuilt (or remodeled) throughout life in a process in which old bone tissue is broken down (or resorbed) by cells called osteoclasts and replaced with new bone tissue by cells called osteoblasts. In healthy young adults, the overall rate of remodeling is usually in balance so that the amount of bone lost is about equal to the amount that is replaced.
However, after menopause, more bone is broken down than is replaced, causing bone loss to occur and bones to become weaker. This is due to a drop in the level of estrogen. In the first five years after menopause, women may lose as much as 25% of their bone mass. In fact, menopause is the single most important risk factor for osteoporosis in women.
In patients with Paget's disease of bone, excessive remodeling causes the bone to be enlarged but fragile, and may result in bone pain, deformities, fractures and in some cases, arthritis and neurological complications.
Merck estimates that the retail price for a daily dose of 10 mg will be between $1.65 and $1.80.",
Osteoporosis,Miacalcin (calcitonin-salmon) Nasal Spray,"General Information
Miacalcin Nasal Spray (MNS) is a synthetic form of the hormone calcitonin, which inhibits bone loss. Previously available only in injectable form, Miacalcin is now available in a nasal spray.
Miacalcin is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women who are more than five years past menopause and who have low bone mass compared with women before menopause. MNS is recommended for women who refuse or cannot tolerate estrogens or in whom estrogens should not be used. MNS should be taken with adequate calcium (at least 1000 mg elemental calcium per day) and vitamin D (400 international units) per day.
The medication has been used by thousands of women in 72 countries outside the U.S.
Clinical Results
Evidence of efficacy is based on increases in spinal bone mineral density observed in 551 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who were studied for up to two years.
","Side Effects
Nasal irritation and other symptoms of the nose such as dryness, redness, itching, or bleeding were the most commonly reported side effects.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Miacalcin nasal spray, like natural calcitonin, acts primarily by inhibiting osteoclasts, the cells that break down existing bone, thereby decreasing the rate of bone breakdown, allowing the body to build bone naturally."
Osteoporosis,Ortho-Prefest,"General Information
ORTHO-PREFEST is a single-tablet prescription hormone replacement therapy (HRT) indicated in women with an intact uterus for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, and prevention of osteoporosis.
Clinical Results
Clinical trials tested post-menopausal women and found that ORTHO-PREFEST was safe and effective in reducing hot-flashes and providing relief from vaginal atrophy.
","Side Effects
The most common side effects in clinical trials over a one-year period were headache and breast pain. These effects were rarely serious enough to cause women to discontinue treatment. Other side-effects experienced by patients during trials included back pain, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, abdominal pain, nausea, arthralgias (joint pain), dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation), vaginal bleeding, vaginitis, pharyngitis (inflammation of the throat), sinusitis and URIs (upper respiratory infections).
Warnings/Precautions
Estrogens have been associated with increased risks of serious side-effects including thromboembolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, and endometrial carcinoma in post-menopausal women.
Do not take this drug (or any estrogens) if you have a known or suspected pregnancy, breast cancer, or estrogen-dependent neoplasia. Also, do not take estrogens if you have undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding, active thrombophlebitis, or thromboembolic disorders.
Women should consult their doctor before beginning hormone replacement therapy.

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Premarin was based on the following studies:
Vasomotor symptoms
Data are from 2,805 postmenopausal women enrolled in the HOPE Study. The women were randomly assigned to one of eight treatment groups, receiving either placebo or conjugated estrogens, with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate. Efficacy for vasomotor symptoms was assessed during the first 12 weeks of treatment in a subset of symptomatic women (n = 241) who had at least seven moderate to severe hot flushes daily, or at least 50 moderate to severe hot flushes during the week before randomization. Premarin (0.3 mg, 0.45 mg, and 0.625 mg tablets) was shown to be statistically better than placebo at weeks 4 and 12 for relief of both the frequency and severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.
Effects on vulvar and vaginal atrophy
Results of vaginal maturation indexes at cycles 6 and 13 showed that the differences from placebo were statistically significant (p < 0.001) for all treatment groups (conjugated estrogens alone and conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment groups).
Effects on bone mineral density
Data is from the double-blind, randomized, placebo/active-drug-controlled, multicenter HOPE study. The study enrolled healthy postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, who were 2.3 Â± 0.9 years on average since menopause and took one 600-mg tablet of elemental calcium (Caltrate) daily. The subjects were treated with Premarin 0.625 mg, 0.45 mg, 0.3 mg, or placebo. Prevention of bone loss was assessed by measurement of bone mineral density (BMD), primarily at the anteroposterior lumbar spine (L2 to L4). Secondarily, BMD measurements of the total body, femoral neck, and trochanter were also analyzed. All active treatment groups showed significant differences from placebo in each of the four BMD endpoints at cycles 6, 13, 19, and 26. The mean percent increases in the primary efficacy measure (L2 to L4 BMD) at the final on-therapy evaluation (cycle 26 for those who completed and the last available evaluation for those who discontinued early) were 2.46% with 0.625 mg, 2.26% with 0.45 mg, and 1.13% with 0.3 mg. The placebo group showed a mean percent decrease from baseline at the final evaluation of 2.45%. These results supported the efficacy of the lower doses.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Premarin may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Osteoporosis,Prempro & Premphase (conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets),"General Information
Prempro/Premphase is an estrogen plus progestin hormone replacement therapy.
Prempro/Premphase is specifically indicated for:
the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause
the treatment of moderate to severe vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause
the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis
The recommended dose is as follows:
Prempro: one tablet containing conjugated estrogens (CE) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) taken orally once daily. Premphase: one maroon tablet containing 0.625 mg CE taken orally on days 1 through 14, and one light-blue tablet containing 0.625 mg CE plus 5.0 mg MPA taken orally on days 15 through 28.
Clinical Results
Most studies have not shown a higher risk of breast cancer in women who have used estrogens. Some studies have reported that breast cancer developed more often in women who used estrogens for long periods of time or who used high doses for shorter time periods. The effects of added progestins on the risk of breast cancer are unknown. Some studies have reported a moderately increased risk in those taking combination estrogen/progestin therapy, even higher than the possible risk of taking estrogens alone. Other studies have not shown this relationship. The addition of progestin may have unfavorable effects on blood sugars and fats, which might make a diabetic condition worse.
","Side Effects
The most commonly reported side effects in the clinical study were breast tenderness, headache, and abdominal pain. Rarely, however, were these serious enough to cause women to stop therapy.
","Additional Information
Previously, physicians have prescribed estrogen and progestin for nonhysterectomized women needing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in a variety of different regimens. Until now, a woman taking estrogen and progestin at different times throughout the month had to keep track of where she was in her cycle and whether she needed to take one tablet (estrogen alone), or two tablets (estrogen and progestin) on any given day. As a result, many women found their HRT regimens difficult to follow.
Some women should not take HRT. A woman should make sure her doctor or health care provider is aware of her personal or family health history before taking HRT. This history should include instances of breast cancer, breast lumps, abnormal vaginal bleeding, abnormal blood clotting, severe headache, dizziness, and liver disease. Women who are pregnant should not take HRT. Estrogens have been reported to increase the risk of cancer of the uterus in postmenopausal women.",

Osteoporosis,Reclast (zoledronic acid),"General Information
Reclast (zoledronic acid) is is a bisphosphonic acid inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption. Once administered, it rapidly moves to bone and preferentially localizes at sites of high bone turnover.
Reclast is specifically indicated for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.
Reclast is supplied as 5 mg in a 100 mL ready to infuse solution for intravenous administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is a 5 mg infusion once a year given intravenously over no less than 15 minutes.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Reclast was based on the results of a clinical trial. This randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, multinational study enrolled 7,736 women aged 65-89 years with osteoporosis. The subjects were stratified into two groups Stratum I: no concomitant use of osteoporosis therapy or Stratum II: baseline concomitant use of osteoporosis therapies which included calcitonin, raloxifene, tamoxifen and hormone replacement therapy. Reclast was administered once a year for three consecutive years, as a single 5 mg dose in 100 mL solution infused over at least 15 minutes, for a total of three doses. All subjects received 1000 to 1500 mg of elemental calcium plus 400 to 1200 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. The subjects in Stratum I were evaluated annually for incidence of vertebral fractures. The subjects in Stratum I and II were evaluated for the incidence of hip and other clinical fractures. The primary endpoints were the incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures at 3 years and the incidence of hip fractures over a median duration of 3 years.
Effect on vertebral fractures over three years
Reclast significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures over three years compared to placebo. In the Reclast arm, there was a 3.3% rate of at least one new vertebral fracture versus 10.9% in the placebo arm (p <0.0001) for a 7.6% absolute reduction in fracture incidence and 70% reduction in fracture incidence.
Effect on hip fracture over three years
Reclast demonstrated a 1.1% absolute reduction and 41% relative reduction in the risk of hip fractures over a median duration of 3 years. The hip fracture event rate was 1.4% for Reclast -treated subjects compared to 2.5% for placebo -treated subjects.
Reclast also had a positive effect over placebo in the following areas:
Bone Mineral Density
Reclast significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck, relative to treatment with placebo at time points 12, 24, and 36 months. Treatment with Reclast resulted in a 6.7% increase in BMD at the lumbar spine, 6.0 % at the total hip, and 5.1% at the femoral neck, over 3 years as compared to placebo.
Bone Histology
Bone biopsy specimens were obtained between months 33 and 36 from 82 subjects treated with 3 annual doses of Reclast. Qualitative, quantitative and micro CT assessments showed bone of normal architecture and quality without mineralization defects.
Effect on Height
Over the three-year study standing height was measured annually using a stadiometer. The Reclast group revealed less height loss compared to placebo (4.2 mm vs. 7.0 mm, respectively (p<0.001)).
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Reclast may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Arthralgia
Pyrexia
Hypertension
Headache

Osteoporosis,Vivelle (estradiol transdermal system),"General Information
Vivelle provides estrogen replacement therapy by releasing estradiol through a controlled release patch. Estradiol is an estrogenic hormone secreted by the human ovary. Estrogen levels decrease after menopause, which may in turn increase the risk of osteoporosis. Vivelle works to counteract this loss through the continual release of estradiol. The hormone is contained in the adhesive of the patch, and the system is designed to release estradiol upon application to the skin.
Clinical Results
In two controlled clinical trials of 356 subjects, two dose levels of Vivelle were tested. The 0.075 and 0.1 mg doses were superior to a placebo in relieving vasomotor symptoms at week four, and maintained efficacy through weeks eight and 12 of treatment. An additional 12-week placebo-controlled study in 255 patients was performed to test the lowest dose of 0.0375 mg. The 0.0375 mg dose was also superior to a placebo in reducing both the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms.
The Vivelle system's possible benefits in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis have also been examined. A 2-year double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel group study was conducted with a total of 261 individuals. The enrolled group consisted of hysterectomized (161) and non-hysterectomized (100), surgically or naturally menopausal women (within 5 years of menopause), with no evidence of osteoporosis. There was an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) of the AP lumbar spine in all Vivelle groups, compared to a decrease in AP lumbar spine BMD observed in placebo patients. All Vivelle doses were significantly superior to a placebo at all time points with the exception of Vivelle 0.05 mg/day at 6 months. The highest dose of Vivelle was superior to the three lower doses.

","Side Effects
Adverse reactions associated with Vivelle include (but are not limited to) the following:
Headache
Skin irritation at the application site
Nausea
Breast tenderness or enlargement
Back pain
Vaginal spotting or bleeding
Additionally, estrogens should not be used by individuals with any of the following conditions:
Known or suspected pregnancy
Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding
Known or suspected breast cancer
","Additional Information
For more information on osteoporosis, please visit the web site of The Endocrine Society. This site provides fact sheets for patients on a variety of topics.","Mechanism of Action
Vivelle provides systemic estrogen replacement therapy through the release of estradiol. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.
Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism and estrogen therapy acts to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

"Otolaryngology (Ear, Nose, Throat)",Bactroban Nasal 2% (mupirocin calcium ointment),"General Information
Bactroban Nasal has been approved as an intranasally administered topical agent for the eradication of nasal colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This treatment has been approved for adult subjects and health care workers as part of a comprehensive infection control program to reduce the risk of MRSA infection during institutional outbreaks of infections with this pathogen. A problem first confined to tertiary care centers and large teaching hospitals, MRSA outbreaks increasingly affect hospitals and other health care institutions of all sizes and, once established, have proven extremely difficult to eradicate.
Bactroban Nasal is available in a one-gram single-use applicator tube and is formulated specifically for intranasal use. The recommended course of therapy is twice daily application for five days.
Clinical Results
Analysis of six U.S. clinical trials designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Bactroban Nasal in eliminating S. aureus from the nostrils in health care workers showed that of the volunteers evaluated for efficacy, nasal carriage of S. aureus was eliminated in 91% of volunteers receiving Bactroban Nasal, but only 6% of volunteers receiving placebo. In addition, 74% of the volunteers treated with Bactroban Nasal who were free of S. aureus at the end of therapy (five days) remained free of the bacteria four weeks after treatment compared with 12.5% of the placebo volunteers. No serious side effects were reported. Only one of 339 participants withdrew from the study due to a side effect.
","Side Effects
The most frequently reported side effects associated with Bactroban Nasal were headache (9%), rhinitis (6%), and respiratory disorder including upper respiratory tract congestion (5%).
","Additional Information
According to an estimate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), each year approximately two million patients in the United States contract hospital-acquired infections. Further complicating this problem is antibiotic resistance, which hampers treatment of the infections.
Subjects at high risk of MRSA infection may include those undergoing surgery and those being treated in intensive care units. For this reason, it is important to contain nasal carriage of MRSA. By eradicating MRSA from the nose, Bactroban Nasal interrupts the transmission of the bacteria to a potential site of infection.",

Depakote ER is an extended-release product used to prevent or reduce the occurrence of migraines. It is indicated for the prevention of migraine headaches in adults; however, there is no evidence that it is useful in the acute treatment of migraine headaches. Depakote ER is provided in tablet form.
About 23 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches, and approximately 75% of migraine sufferers are women. Migraines may also include nausea and/or vomiting, as well as sensitivity to light and sound.
Clinical Results
The results of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial demonstrated the effectiveness of Depakote ER in the prevention of migraine headaches. Patients who experienced two migraine headaches in a four-week baseline period were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Depakote ER or placebo and treated for 12 weeks. Patients began treatment on 500 mg once daily for one week, and were then increased to 1000 mg once daily with an option to decrease the dose back to 500 mg during the second week if intolerance occurred. 98 of 114 Depakote ER-treated patients (86%) and 100 of 110 placebo-treated patients (91%) treated at least two weeks maintained the 1000 mg once daily dose for the duration of their treatment. Treatment outcome was based on the reduction of the four-week migraine headache rate in the treatment period compared to the baseline period.
Two hundred and two patients (101 in each treatment group) completed the treatment period. The mean reduction in the four-week migraine headache rate was 1.2 from a baseline mean of 4.4 in the Depakote ER group, versus 0.6 from a baseline mean of 4.2 in the placebo group.

Dupixent (dupilumab) is a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling by speciï¬�cally binding to the IL-4RÎ± subunit shared by the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes. Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor. Multiple cell types that express IL-4RÎ± (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, goblet cells) and inï¬‚ammatory mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines, chemokines) are involved in inï¬‚ammation. Blocking IL-4RÎ± with dupilumab inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine-induced inï¬‚ammatory responses, including the release of proinï¬‚ammatory cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide, and IgE.

Grastek is specifically indicated for use in subjects ages 5 through 65 years as immunotherapy for the treatment of grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis confirmed by positive skin test or in vitro testing for pollen-specific IgE antibodies for Timothy grass or cross-reactive grass pollens.
Grastek is is supplied as a tablet for sublingual (under the tongue) administration. The recommended dose is one tablet daily. The first dose should be administered in a healthcare setting under the supervision of a physician with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases. The patient should be observed for at least 30 minutes to monitor for signs or symptoms of a severe systemic or a severe local allergic reaction. If the patient tolerates the first dose, subsequent doses may be taken at home. Treatment should be initiated at least 12 weeks before the expected onset of each grass pollen season and continue treatment throughout the season.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Grastek in the treatment of allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis in Timothy grass pollen allergic subjects 5 years of age and older, with or without mild asthma, was evaluated during the first grass pollen season in two trials of approximately 24 weeks treatment duration. The sustained effect of Grastek was evaluated in one trial conducted over 5 grass pollen seasons. All three trials were randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials. Subjects had a history of grass pollen induced rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis and sensitivity to Timothy grass pollen as determined by specific testing (IgE). In these three studies, subjects initiated Grastek or placebo approximately 12 weeks prior to the pollen season. In the long-term study, subjects received Grastek or placebo daily for 3 consecutive years and were followed for 2 years without treatment. Subjects were allowed to take symptom relieving medications. Efficacy was established by self-reporting of rhinoconjunctivitis daily symptom scores (DSS) and daily medication scores (DMS). Daily rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms included four nasal symptoms (runny nose, stuffy nose, sneezing, and itchy nose), and two ocular symptoms (gritty/itchy eyes and watery eyes). The rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms were measured on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The sums of the DSS and DMS were combined into the Total Combined Score (TCS) which was averaged over the entire grass pollen season.
First Season Efficacy
Adults and Children
This placebo-controlled trial evaluated 1,501 subjects 5 through 65 years of age and compared Grastek to placebo administered as a sublingual tablet daily for approximately 24 weeks. TCS score over Entire season: Grastek: 3.24 versus placebo: 4.22. TCS score over Peak season: Grastek: 3.33 versus placebo: 4.22.
Children
This double-blind clinical trial of approximately 24 weeks duration evaluated 344 pediatric subjects 5 to 17 years of age who were treated with either Grastek or placebo once daily. TCS score for Grastek: 4.62 versus for placebo: 6.25.

Keytruda is supplied as an injection for intravenous administration. The recommended dose of Keytruda for esophageal cancer is 200 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Keytruda for esophageal cancer was based on the KEYNOTE-181 and KEYNOTE-180 clinical trials.
KEYNOTE-181 was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial that enrolled 628 patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 and who progressed on or after one prior line of systemic treatment for advanced disease. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either Keytruda 200 mg every three weeks or investigatorâ€™s choice of any of the following chemotherapy regimens, all given intravenously: paclitaxel 80-100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every four-week cycle, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every three weeks, or irinotecan 180 mg/m2 every two weeks. Treatment with Keytruda or chemotherapy continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The trial met its primary endpoint of significantly improving overall survival (OS), with a 31% decrease in the risk of death compared to a chemotherapy regimen of paclitaxel, docetaxel or irinotecan.
KEYNOTE-180 was a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label trial that enrolled 121 patients with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer who progressed on or after at least two prior systemic treatments for advanced disease. With the exception of the number of prior lines of treatment, the eligibility criteria were similar to and the dosage regimen identical to KEYNOTE-181. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR). The ORR in the 35 patients with ESCC expressing PD-L1 (CPS â‰¥10) was 20%. Among the seven responding patients, the DoR ranged from 4.2 to 25.1+ months, with five patients (71%) having responses of six months or longer and three patients (57%) having responses of 12 months or longer.

Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD 1)-blocking, humanized monoclonal IgG4 kappa antibody. Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response.

For children and adolescents 10 through 17 years of age, the dose is increased over the first three days as follows: Day 1: 100 IR, Day 2: 200 IR and Day 3: 300 IR.
The first dose of Oralair should be administered in a healthcare setting in which acute allergic reactions can be treated under the supervision of a physician with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of severe allergic reactions. After receiving the first dose of Oralair, the patient should be observed for at least 30 minutes to monitor for signs or symptoms of a severe systemic or a severe local allergic reaction. If the patient tolerates the first dose, the patient may take subsequent doses at home.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Oralair was based on five trials; four natural field studies and one environmental exposure chamber study.
Natural Field Studies:
These included three trials, each conducted over a single season (two in adults and one in adolescents and children) and one five-year study (adults). Subjects received Oralair or placebo daily for four months prior to grass pollen season and throughout grass pollen season. The efficacy of Oralair was assessed via daily recording of symptoms and rescue medication use. The daily Combined Score (CS, range: 0-3) equally weights symptoms and rescue medication use. The daily Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score (RTSS, range 0-18) is the total of the six individual symptom scores (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, nasal congestion, ocular pruritus and watery eyes) each graded by participants on a 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms) scale. The daily Rescue Medication Score (RMS, range 0-3) grades the intake of rescue medication as 0 = absent, 1 = antihistamine, 2 = nasal corticosteroid, 3 = oral corticosteroid. The primary endpoints were reached in each of the studies, with significant improvements in each of the the measurements of efficacy over placebo..
Allergen environmental chamber study
In an allergen environmental chamber study, 89 adults with grass pollen-associated allergic rhinoconjunctivitis were challenged with four of the five grass pollens contained in Oralair at baseline and after 4 months of treatment with Oralair (n=45) or placebo (n=44). The average Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score (RTSS) of each group during the 4 hours of the allergen challenge was assessed. The primary endpoints were achieved; with significant improvements in the measurement of efficacy over placebo.

"Otolaryngology (Ear, Nose, Throat)",Patanase (olopatadine hydrochloride),"General Information
Patanase is an antihistamine with selective H1 -receptor antagonist activity: its principal effects are mediated via inhibition of H1 receptors.
Patanase is specifically indicated for the relief of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 12 years of age and older.
Patanase is supplied as a metered-dose manual spray pump designed for intranasal administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is two sprays per nostril twice daily. Patanase must be primed before initial use and when it has not been used for more than 7 days.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Patanase was based on the results of three clinical trials. These randomized, double blind, parallel group, multicenter, placebo (vehicle nasal spray)-controlled clinical trials 1,598 subjects, aged 12 years and older, in the United States. The subjects received Patanase Nasal Spray 0.6%, Patanase Nasal Spray 0.4%, or vehicle nasal spray, two sprays per nostril, twice-daily. The duration of the study was two weeks. Efficacy was based on patient recording of 4 individual nasal symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy nose, and sneezing) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 3 = severe) as reflective or instantaneous scores. Reflective scoring recorded symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; instantaneous scoring recorded symptom severity at the time of recording. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference from placebo in the percent change from baseline in the sum of morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) at the end of the treatment period. In all studies Patanase exhibited statistically significantly greater decreases in rTNSS compared to vehicle nasal spray. Study One: In the Patanase 0.6% and 0.4% groups, the change from baseline was -3.63 and -3.38, respectively, compared to -2.67 for the placebo group (p <0.0001 for the high dose group). Study Two: In the Patanase 0.6% and 0.4% groups, the change from baseline was -2.90 and -2.63, respectively, compared to -1.92 in the placebo group (p<0.0001 for the high dose group).
Onset of action was evaluated in three environmental exposure unit studies. In these studies, subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to high levels of pollen in an environmental exposure unit and then treated with either Patanase Nasal Spray or vehicle nasal spray, two sprays in each nostril. Afterwards they self-reported their allergy symptoms hourly as instantaneous scores for the subsequent 12 hours. Patanase 0.6% was found to have an onset of action of 30 minutes after dosing in the environmental exposure unit and a twelve hour duration of effect.

"Otolaryngology (Ear, Nose, Throat)",Protonix (pantoprazole sodium) Delayed-Release Tablets,"General Information
Protonix is an acid suppressant indicated for the short-term treatment (up to eight weeks) in the healing and symptomatic relief of erosive esophagitis associated with GERD. An additional 8-week treatment with Protonix may be considered if healing has not commenced after the first 8 week treatment period.
Protonix has been shown to relieve both daytime and night-time heartburn. It is effective when stomach acids exceed a certain level: pH less than 4.
Esophagitis may be caused by irritation of the esophagus due to acid reflux from the stomach to the esophagus. Although 36% of healthy Americans experience this sort of reflux at least once a month, perhaps up to 10% of American adults suffer from GERD on a daily basis. Erosive esophagitis can be a precursor to more serious esophageal diseases.
Clinical Results
In a US, multi-center double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Protonix was administered in 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg doses once daily in patients with reflux symptoms and endoscopically diagnosed erosive esophagitis (EE) of grade 2 or above (Hetzel-Dent scale). All three dosages yielded significantly better healing rates than the placebo. The 40 mg dose resulted in better healing rates than the 20 mg or 10 mg doses. Patients taking the 40 mg dose experienced complete cessation of heartburn and consumed significantly fewer antacid tablets per day starting on the first day of treatment.
Another clinical research study compared 20 mg and 40 mg once daily doses of Protonix with nizatidine 150 mg twice daily. Nizatidine is a histamine H2-blocker indicated for ulcers and other gastric disorders. Results of this study indicated that both doses of Protonix yielded significantly superior rates of healing at both 4 and 8 weeks compared with the twice daily dose of nizatidine. Patients taking Protonix also experienced relief of heartburn faster and took significantly fewer antacid tablets per day than those taking nizatidine.
Clinical results also indicated that Protonix is effective in preventing relapse of EE.
","Side Effects
In general, pantoprazole was well tolerated in clinical studies. Adverse effects were not dose related. The following side effects were experienced by 1% or more of patients taking Protonix and had incidence greater than placebo and/or nizatidine:
Diarrhea
Rash
Hyperglycemia
Flatulence
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not yet been established.
No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age, renal impairment, or for patients undergoing hemodialysis.
Safety and effectiveness for long-term treatment (greater than 16 weeks) has not yet been determined.

For more information about GERD and erosive esophagitis, visit the GERD Information Resource Center, sponsored by AstraZeneca LP: www.gerd.com","Mechanism of Action
Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses the final step in gastric acid production by forming a covalent bond to two sites of the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. The binding to the (H+, K+)-ATPase results in a duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours. (From FDA Label)

"Otolaryngology (Ear, Nose, Throat)",Qnasl (beclomethasone dipropionate) nasal aerosol,"General Information
Qnasl nasal aerosol contains the active ingredient beclomethasone dipropionate, an anti-inflammatory steroid.
Qnasl is specifically indicated for the treatment of the nasal symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older.
Qnasl is supplied as a non-aqueous nasal spray solution designed for intranasal inhalation. The recommended dose of Qnasl is 320 mcg per day administered as two nasal aerosol sprays in each nostril (80 mcg/aerosol spray) once daily (maximum total daily dose of four nasal aerosol sprays per day).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Qnasl was based on three randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trials in a total of 1,049 subjects. The three clinical trials included one two-week dose-ranging trial in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis, one two-week efficacy trial in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis, and one six-week efficacy trial in subjects with perennial allergic rhinitis. The subjects received Qnasl 320 mcg once daily administered as two sprays in each nostril or placebo. Assessment of efficacy was based on the total nasal symptom score (TNSS), with the primary endpoint of improvement on TNSS versus placebo when measured from baseline to the end of treatment. TNSS was measured as reflective (rTNSS) or instantaneous (iTNSS). rTNSS required the subjects to record symptom severity over the previous 12 hours; iTNSS required the subjects to record symptom severity over the previous 10 minutes.
Dose-Ranging Trial:
This two-week trial evaluated the efficacy of three doses of beclomethasone dipropionate nasal aerosol (80, 160, and 320 mcg, once daily) in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The 320 mcg/day dose resulted in statistically significant improvements compared with placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint, rTNSS, as well as a statistically significant decrease in morning iTNSS versus placebo, indicating that the effect was maintained over the 24-hour dosing interval.
Seasonal and Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Trials:
In both trials once daily treatment with Qnasl nasal aerosol for two weeks in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis and for six weeks in subjects with perennial allergic rhinitis resulted in statistically significant greater decreases from baseline in the rTNSS and morning iTNSS than placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Qnasl may include, but are not limited to, the following:
nasal discomfort
epistaxis
headache
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Qnasl or seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, please visit the Qnasl web page.","Mechanism of Action
Qnasl contains the active ingredient beclomethasone dipropionate, an antiinflammatory steroid. Beclomethasone dipropionate is a prodrug that is extensively converted to the active metabolite, beclomethasone-17-monopropionate. The precise mechanism through which beclomethasone dipropionate affects rhinitis symptoms is unknown. Corticosteroids have been shown to have multiple anti-inflammatory effects, inhibiting both inflammatory cells (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) and the release of inflammatory mediators.

Ragwitek contains pollen allergen extract from Short Ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia). The precise mechanisms of action of allergen immunotherapy are not known.
Ragwitek allergen extract is specifically indicated as immunotherapy, for use in adults 18 to 65 years of age, for the treatment of short ragweed pollen-induced allergic rhinitis, with or without conjunctivitis, confirmed by positive skin test or in vitro testing for pollen-specific IgE antibodies for short ragweed pollen.
Ragwitek is supplied as a tablet for sublingual (under the tongue) administration. The recommended dose is one tablet daily. The first dose should be administered in a healthcare setting under the supervision of a physician with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases. The patient should be observed for at least 30 minutes to monitor for signs or symptoms of a severe systemic or a severe local allergic reaction. If the patient tolerates the first dose, subsequent doses may be taken at home. Treatment should be initiated at least 12 weeks before the expected onset of ragweed pollen season and continue treatment throughout the season.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ragwitek was based on two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 767 adults 18 through 50 years of age. The population included subjects with asthma. Subjects received Ragwitek or placebo for approximately 12 weeks prior to the start of the ragweed pollen season and throughout the ragweed pollen season. Symptom-relieving medications were allowed as needed. Efficacy was established by self-reporting of rhinoconjunctivitis daily symptom scores (DSS) and daily medication scores (DMS). Daily rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms included four nasal symptoms (runny nose, stuffy nose, sneezing, and itchy nose), and two ocular symptoms (gritty/itchy eyes and watery eyes). The rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms were measured on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The sums of the DSS and DMS were combined into the Total Combined Score (TCS) which was averaged over the peak ragweed pollen season. Also, in each study, the average TCS over the entire ragweed season was assessed. A decrease in TCS during the peak ragweed season for subjects treated with Ragwitek compared to placebo treated subjects was demonstrated in both trials. Subjects treated with Ragwitek also showed a decrease in the average TCS from the start of and throughout the entire ragweed pollen season. TCS score Peak season: Ragwitek: 6.22 versus placebo: 8.46. TCS score Entire season: Ragwitek: 5.21 versus placebo: 7.01.

Hycamtin has been approved for the treatment of subjects with metastatic ovarian cancer after failure of initial or subsequent chemotherapy. After initial therapy, cancer cells frequently become resistant to existing chemotherapies. Hycamtin produced responses after progression with prior chemotherapy used to treat ovarian cancer, including platinum compounds and paclitaxel.
Clinical Results
In an open, randomized comparison study, 20% of subjects receiving Hycamtin responded to treatment compared to 12% of subjects receiving paclitaxel. Response was defined as 50% or greater shrinkage in tumor size. Median progression-free survival or time to progression for all treated subjects, defined as the time when the tumor progresses, was both statistically and clinically significant, indicating that subjects receiving Hycamtin experienced progressive disease less rapidly--23 weeks compared to 14 weeks for paclitaxel.
The efficacy of Hycamtin was confirmed in an additional open, noncomparative study. In each study, the dosage of Hycamtin was 1.5 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes daily for five days and repeated every 21 days.
","Side Effects
As with many cancer chemotherapeutic agents, the main side effect demonstrated by Hycamtin in clinical trials was suppression of blood cells produced in the bone marrow that was predictable, noncumulative, reversible, and manageable. The most frequently reported non-hematologic side effects were gastrointestinal, including nausea and vomiting. However, only 8% of all subjects experienced severe nausea.

Lynparza (olaparib) is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. It selectively binds to and inhibits PARP, inhibiting PARP-mediated repair of single strand DNA breaks; PARP inhibition enhances the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents and reverses tumor cell chemoresistance and radioresistance.
Lynparza is specifically indicated as monotherapy in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutated (as detected by an FDA-approved test) advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy.
Lynparza is supplied as capsules for oral administration. The recommended dose is 400 mg taken twice daily. Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Lynparza was approved for ovarian cancer under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. The FDA approval of Lynparza was based on a single-arm study in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) advanced cancers. A total of 137 patients with measurable, gBRCAm associated ovarian cancer treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy were enrolled. All patients received Lynparza at a dose of 400 mg twice daily as monotherapy until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) were assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. The percentage of patients with ORR was 34% and the median DOR was 7.9 months.

Zejula is specifically indicated for the maintenance treatment of adults with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.
Zejula is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended dose of Zejua as monotherapy is 300 mg (three 100 mg capsules) taken orally once daily. Zejula should be administered at approximately the same time each day. Each capsule should be swallowed whole and may be taken with or without food. Patients should start treatment with Zejula no later than 8 weeks after their most recent platinum-containing regimen. Zejula treatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the case of a missed dose, the next dose should be administered at its regularly scheduled time. If a patient vomits or misses a dose of Zejula, an additional dose should not be taken.
Please see drug label for additional modifications.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Zejula was based on NOVA, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 553 patients with platinum sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer were randomized 2:1 to Zejula 300 mg orally daily or matched placebo within 8 weeks of the last therapy. All patients had received at least two prior platinum-containing regimens and were in response (complete or partial) to their most recent platinum-based regimen. The major efficacy outcome measure, PFS (progression-free survival), was determined primarily by central independent assessment per RECIST. Among patients who were germline BRCA mutation carriers, the niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical significance over the control arm for the primary endpoint of PFS. The median PFS for patients treated with niraparib was 21.0 months, compared to 5.5 months for control (p < 0.0001). For patients who were not germline BRCA mutation carriers but whose tumors were determined to be HRD positive, the niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical significance over the control arm for the primary endpoint of PFS. The median PFS for patients with HRD-positive tumors who were treated with niraparib was 12.9 months, compared to 3.8 months for control (p < 0.0001). Niraparib also showed statistical significance in the overall non-germline BRCA mutant cohort, which included patients with both HRD-positive and HRD-negative tumors. The niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical significance over the control arm for the primary endpoint of PFS. The median PFS for patients treated with niraparib was 9.3 months, compared to 3.9 months for control (p < 0.0001).

Zejula (niraparib) is an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, PARP-1 and PARP-2, which play a role in DNA repair. In vitro studies have shown that niraparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes resulting in DNA damage, apoptosis and cell death. Increased niraparib-induced cytotoxicity was observed in tumor cell lines with or without deficiencies in BRCA1/2. Niraparib decreased tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and in human patient-derived xenograft tumor models with homologous recombination deficiency that had either mutated or wild type BRCA1/2.

Wakix (pitolisant) is a histamine-3 (H3) receptor antagonist/inverse agonist.
Wakix is specifically indicated for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adult patients with narcolepsy.
Wakix is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dosage range for Wakix is 17.8 mg to 35.6 mg administered orally once daily in the morning upon wakening. Titrate dosage as follows: Week 1: Initiate with a dosage of 8.9 mg (two 4.45 mg tablets) once daily Week 2: Increase dosage to 17.8 mg (one 17.8 mg tablet) once daily Week 3: May increase to the maximum recommended dosage of 35.6 mg (two 17.8 mg tablets) once daily
Dose may be adjusted based on tolerability. If a dose is missed, patients should take the next dose the following day in the morning upon wakening.
It may take up to 8 weeks for some patients to achieve a clinical response.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Wakix was based on two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Patients â‰¥18 years of age who met the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) criteria for narcolepsy and who had an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score â‰¥14 were eligible to enroll in the studies. EDS was assessed using the ESS, an 8-item questionnaire by which patients rate their perceived likelihood of falling asleep during usual daily life activities. Each of the 8 items on the ESS is rated from 0 (would never doze) to 3 (high chance of dozing); the maximum score is 24. Study 1 and Study 2 included an 8-week treatment period, a 3-week dose titration phase followed by a 5-week stable dose phase. These studies compared Wakix to both a placebo and an active control.
In Study 1, 95 patients were randomized to receive Wakix placebo, or active control. The dose of Wakix was initiated at 8.9 mg once daily and could be increased at weekly intervals to 17.8 mg or 35.6 mg, based on efficacy response and tolerability. No dose adjustments were permitted during the 5-week stable dose phase. Wakix demonstrated statistically significantly greater improvement on the primary endpoint, the least square mean final ESS score compared to placebo.
Wakix (n=31)/Placebo (n=30)
Baseline ESS Score Mean was 17.8 and 18.9, respectively
Final ESS Score LS Mean at Week 8 was 12.4 and 15.5, respectively.
In Study 2, 166 patients were randomized to receive Wakix, placebo, or active control. The dose of Wakix was initiated at 4.45 mg and could be increased at weekly intervals to 8.9 mg or 17.8 mg, based on efficacy response and tolerability. No dose adjustments were permitted during the 5-week stable-dose phase.

Elzonris (tagraxofusp-erzs) is a CD123-directed cytotoxin.
Elzonris is specifically indicated for the treatment of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) in adults and in pediatric patients 2 years and older.
Elzonris is supplied as an injection for intravenous administration. The recommended dose of Elzonris is 12 mcg/kg intravenously over 15 minutes once daily on days 1 to 5 of a 21-day cycle. The dosing period may be extended for dose delays up to day 10 of the cycle. Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Prior to the first dose of the first cycle, ensure serum albumin is greater than or equal to 3.2 g/dL before administering Elzonris. Premedicate patients with an H1-histamine antagonist (e.g., diphenhydramine hydrochloride), H2-histamine antagonist (e.g., ranitidine), corticosteroid (e.g., 50 mg intravenous methylprednisolone or equivalent) and acetaminophen (or paracetamol) approximately 60 minutes prior to each Elzonris infusion. Administer Cycle 1 of Elzonris in the inpatient setting with patient observation through at least 24 hours after the last infusion. ï‚· Administer subsequent cycles of Elzonris in the inpatient setting or in a suitable outpatient ambulatory care setting that is equipped with appropriate monitoring for patients with hematopoietic malignancies undergoing treatment. Observe patients for a minimum of 4 hours following each infusion.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Elzonris was based on a multicenter, multi-cohort, open-label, single-arm, clinical trial (STML-401-0114) which enrolled 47 patients with BPDCN, including 32 treatment-naÃ¯ve and 15 previously-treated patients, at seven sites in the U.S. Patients received Elzonris intravenously on days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle for multiple consecutive cycles. The trial consisted of three stages: Stage 1 (lead-in, dose escalation), Stage 2 (expansion) and Stage 3 (pivotal, confirmatory). Patients were also enrolled in an additional cohort (Stage 4) to enable uninterrupted access to Elzonris. In the Stage 3 (pivotal) cohort, 13 patients with treatment-naÃ¯ve BPDCN received Elzonris at the labeled dose and schedule. Efficacy was based on the rate of complete response or clinical complete response (CR/CRc), with CRc defined as complete response with residual skin abnormality not indicative of active disease. In this pivotal cohort, the CR/CRc rate was 53.8% (7/13). The median duration of CR/CRc was not reached (range: 3.9 to 12.2 months). In addition, in 29 treatment-naÃ¯ve patients who received Elzonris at 12 mcg/kg/day, the overall response rate (ORR) was 90% (26/29). In these patients, the CR/CRc rate was 72% (21/29) with a median duration of CR/CRc not reached (range: 1.3 to 32.2 months). Forty-five percent (13/29) of these patients were bridged to stem cell transplant (SCT), following remission on Elzonris. The median overall survival (OS), among 29 treatment-naÃ¯ve patients who received Elzonris at 12 mcg/kg/day was not reached (range: 0.2 to 42.0 months, with median follow-up of 23.0 months [range: 0.2 to 41+ months]).

Nephrology,Afinitor (everolimus),"General Information
Afinitor is an inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers. Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation and inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies.
Afinitor is specifically indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib.
Afinitor is supplied as a 5 mg or 10 mg tablet designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 10 mg, to be taken once daily at the same time every day, either with or without food. Afinitor tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water; they should not be chewed or crushed.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Afinitor was based on the results of a clinical trial. This international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study enrolled 416 subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with sunitinib, sorafenib, or both sequentially. The subjects received Afinitor 10 mg once daily or placebo, both in conjunction with best cupportive care. After documented radiological progression, subjects could be unblinded by the investigator: those randomized to placebo were then able to receive open-label Afinitor 10 mg daily. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), documented using RECIST criteria. The median progression-free survival was 4.9 months for Afinitor versus 1.9 months for placebo (p<0.0001).

Anturol is a topical gel formulation of the muscarinic ACh antagonist oxybutynin, based on Antares' Advanced Transdermal Delivery (ATD) technology platform. Oxybutynin results in relaxation of bladder smooth muscle. In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary detrusor contractions, oxybutynin increases maximum urinary bladder capacity and increases the volume to first detrusor contraction.
Anturol is specifically indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency.
Anturol gel is supplied in a metered dose pump for toplical administration. The recommended dosage is three pumps (84 mg/day) applied once daily to clean, dry, intact skin on the abdomen, or upper arms/shoulders, or thighs.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Anturol was based on a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter 12-week study. The trial enrolled approximately 620 subjects with urinary frequency and urge and mixed urinary incontinence with a predominance of urge incontinence episodes. The subjects were either treatment-naÃ¯ve or had demonstrated a beneficial response to anticholinergic treatment for OAB. The subjects received 84 mg/day oxybutynin, 56 mg/day oxybutynin, or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to week 12 in the number of urinary incontinence episodes (UIE) per week, as determined from a 3-day patient daily diary. Subjects treated with Anturol (84 mg) experienced a statistically significant decrease in the number of UIE per week from baseline to endpoint compared with placebo (p=0.0445).

Nephrology,Auryxia (Ferric citrate),"General Information
Auryxia (Ferric citrate) is an iron-based compound that has the capacity to bind to phosphate and form non-absorbable complexes. It lowers phosphate levels without raising calcium or aluminum levels.
Ferric citrate is specifically indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis.
Ferric citrate is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended starting dose is 2 tablets orally 3 times per day with meals. Serum phosphorus levels should be monitored and the dose of Ferric Citrate titrated in decrements or increments of 1 to 2 tablets per day as needed to maintain serum phosphorus at target levels, up to a maximum dose of 12 tablets daily. Dose can be titrated at 1-week or longer intervals.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ferric citrate was based on one 56-week, safety and efficacy trial, consisting of a 52-week active-controlled phase and a 4-week, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal period, and one 4-week open-label trial of different fixed doses of Ferric Citrate. Both trials excluded subjects who had an absolute requirement for aluminum containing drugs with meals.
Long-term, Randomized, Controlled, Safety and Efficacy Trial
After the 2-week washout period during which phosphate binders were held, patients with a mean serum phosphorus of 7.5 mg/dL during washout were randomized 2:1 to Ferric Citrate (N=292) or active control (calcium acetate and/or sevelamer carbonate; N=149). The majority of subjects were on hemodialysis. The starting dose of Ferric Citrate was 6 tablets/day, divided with meals. The starting dose of active control was the patientâ€™s dose prior to the washout period. The dose of phosphate binder was increased or decreased as needed to maintain serum phosphorus levels between 3.5 and 5.5 mg/dL, to a maximum of 12 tablets/day. Following completion of the 52-week active-controlled phase, Ferric Citrate-treated patients were eligible to enter a 4-week placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal phase, in which patients were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Ferric Citrate (N=96) or placebo (N=96). The study met the primary endpoint by demonstrating a highly statistically significant change in serum phosphorus versus placebo over the four-week Placebo Control Period. During the placebo-controlled period, the serum phosphorus concentration rose by 2.2 mg/dL in the placebo arm relative to the Ferric Citrate arm. Ferric citrate also demonstrated statistically significant increases in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT), and significant reductions in the use of IV iron and ESAs, versus an active control of sevelamer carbonate and/or calcium acetate over the 52-week Active Control Period of the study. In addition, mean hemoglobin levels were higher in subjects treated with Zerenex as compared to subjects treated with active control.
Fixed-Dose Trial
Following a 1- to 2-week washout from all phosphate-binding agents, 154 patients with hyperphosphatemia (mean serum phosphorus of 7.5 mg/dL) and CKD on dialysis were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1, 6, or 8 tablets/day of Ferric Citrate for 4 weeks. Ferric Citrate was administered with meals; subjects receiving 1 tablet/day were instructed to take it with their largest meal of the day, and subjects on 6 or 8 tablets/day took divided doses in any distribution with meals. Dose-dependent decreases in serum phosphorus were observed by Day 7 and remained relatively stable for the duration of treatment. The demonstrated reductions from baseline to Week 4 in mean serum phosphorus were significantly greater with 6 and 8 tablets/day than with 1 tablet/day (p<0.0001). Mean reduction in serum phosphorus at Week 4 was 0.1 mg/dL with 1 tablet/day, 1.9 mg/dL with 6 tablets/day, and 2.1 mg/dL with 8 tablets/day.

Nephrology,Bavencio (avelumab) plus Inlyta (axitinib),"General Information
Bavencio (avelumab) is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody. Inlyta (axitinib) is a kinase inhibitor.
Bavencio in combination with Inlyta is specifically indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
The recommended dose of Bavencio is 800 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks in combination with Inlyta 5 mg orally taken twice daily (12 hours apart) with or without food until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. When Inlyta is used in combination with Bavencio, dose escalation of Inlyta above the initial 5 mg dose may be considered at intervals of two weeks or longer.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The approval of Bavencio in combination with Inlyta was based on the Phase III JAVELIN Renal 101 study. The randomized (1:1), multicenter, open-label study of Bavencio in combination with Inlyta enrolled 886 patients with untreated advanced RCC regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression [intent-to-treat (ITT) population]. Patients with autoimmune disease or conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded. The major efficacy outcome measures were PFS as assessed by a Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) using RECIST v1.1 and OS in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors using a clinical trial assay (PD-L1 expression level â‰¥1%). If PFS was statistically significant in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors, it was then tested in the ITT population. The combination significantly improved median progression-free survival (PFS) compared with sunitinib by more than five months in the intent-to-treat (ITT) patient population (median PFS for Bavencio in combination with Inlyta: 13.8 months versus sunitinib: 8.4 months). The ITT population included patients regardless of PD-L1 expression and across IMDC (International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database) prognostic risk groups (favorable 21%, intermediate 62% and poor 16%). The objective response rate (ORR) was doubled in the ITT population with Bavencio in combination with Inlyta versus sunitinib (51.4% vs. 25.7%). With a median overall survival (OS) follow-up of 19 months, data for the trial's other primary endpoint of OS were immature, with 27% of deaths in the ITT population.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Bavencio plus Inlyta may include, but are not limited to, the following:
diarrhea
fatigue
hypertension
musculoskeletal pain
nausea
mucositis
palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia
dysphonia
decreased appetite
hypothyroidism
rash
hepatotoxicity,

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Bavencio plus Inlyta or advanced renal cell carcinoma, please visit the Bavencio page","Mechanism of Action
Inlyta (axitinib) is a kinase inhibitor. It has been shown to inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 at therapeutic plasma concentrations. These receptors are implicated in pathologic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression.
Bavencio (avelumab) is a programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody. PD-L1 may be expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells and can contribute to the inhibition of the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors found on T cells and antigen presenting cells suppresses cytotoxic T-cell activity, T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Avelumab binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors PD-1 and B7.1. This interaction releases the inhibitory effects of PD-L1 on the immune response resulting in the restoration of immune responses, including anti-tumor immune responses.

Nephrology,Carbaglu (carglumic acid),"General Information
Carbaglu contains the active substance carglumic acid, a synthetic structural analogue of N-acetylglutamate (NAG), which is an essential allosteric activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS 1) in liver mitochondria. CPS 1 is the first enzyme of the urea cycle, which converts ammonia into urea. NAG is the product of N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), a mitochondrial enzyme. Carglumic acid acts as a replacement for NAG in NAGS deficiency patients by activating CPS 1.
Carbaglu is specifically indicated as an adjunctive therapy in pediatric and adult patients for the treatment of acute hyperammonemia due to the deficiency of the hepatic enzyme N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) and for maintenance therapy in pediatric and adult patients for chronic hyperammonemia due to the deficiency of the hepatic enzyme NAGS.
Carbaglu is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. Carbaglu tablets should not be swallowed whole or crushed. The tablets should be dispersed in water immediately before use. The recommended dosage is as follows:
Adults
100 mg/kg/day to 250 mg/kg/day. Dosing should be titrated based on individual patient plasma ammonia levels and clinical symptoms. The recommended maintenance dose should be titrated to target normal plasma ammonia level for age. In clinical studies, the maintenance doses were usually less than 100 mg/kg/day. The total daily dose should be divided into 2 to 4 doses and rounded to the nearest 100 mg.
Pediatrics
100 mg/kg/day to 250 mg/kg/day. Dosing should be titrated based on individual patient plasma ammonia levels and clinical symptoms. The recommended maintenance dose should be titrated to target normal plasma ammonia level for age. In clinical studies, maintenance doses were usually less than 100 mg/kg/day. The total daily dose should be divided into 2 to 4 doses.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The efficacy of Carbaglu in the treatment of hyperammonemia due to NAGS deficiency was evaluated in a retrospective review of the clinical course of 23 NAGS deficiency patients who received Carbaglu treatment for a median of 7.9 years (range 0.6 to 20.8 years). Short-term efficacy was evaluated using mean and median change in plasma ammonia levels from baseline to days 1 to 3. Persistence of efficacy was evaluated using long-term mean and median change in plasma ammonia level. All 13 patients had abnormal ammonia levels at baseline. The overall mean baseline plasma ammonia level was 271 Âµmol/L. By day 3, normal plasma ammonia levels were attained in patients for whom data were available. Long-term efficacy was measured using the last reported plasma ammonia level for each of the 13 patients analyzed (median length of treatment was 6 years; range 1 to 16 years). The mean and median ammonia levels were 23 Âµmol/L and 24 Âµmol/L, respectively, after a mean treatment duration of 8 years.

Nephrology,Caverject (alprostadil),"General Information
Caverject is the first prescription drug approved for impotence.
It is self-injected into the penis shortly before sexual intercourse. The drug creates an erection by relaxing the smooth muscle tissue and dilating the major artery in the penis, which enhances the blood flow to the penis.
","Side Effects
The drug's most common side effect is penile pain. Other side effects include bleeding at the injection site and an unhealthy, prolonged erection of four to six hours.

Prostaglandin E1 as Treatment for Erectile Failure in Elderly Men, Journal of American Geriatrics Society 1994; 42:1263-1265.
","Additional Information
For the estimated 10 to 20 million American men who suffer from impotence, Caverject provides an alternative to devices previously approved by FDA. A vacuum device involves placing a cylinder-like device and attached pump over the penis. By using the pump, blood is drawn into the penis, creating an erection. A constriction band is then placed at the base of the penis to maintain erection. A second treatment option, the penile implant, involves the surgical placement of cylinders in the penis and is available in a variety of designs.
FDA approved Caverject to treat impotence caused by neurological, vascular or psychological dysfunction. While psychological factors such as anxiety and depression can lead to sexual dysfunction, more than 85% of impotence cases have a physical cause, according to the Impotence Institute of America. A complete physical examination is important so that any underlying condition can be diagnosed and treated. Some common causes of impotence are diabetes, arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), and high blood pressure. Also impotence has reportedly been caused by 16 of the 200 most commonly prescribed drugs, including drugs for high blood pressure, heart disease, and depression.",

Nephrology,Detrol LA (tolterodine tartrate),"General Information
Detrol LA (tolterodine tartrate) is indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency and frequency. It is available by prescription only in a 2 and 4 mg extended release capsule formulation.
Clinical Results
Three placebo-controlled, 12 week studies were held involving a total of 339 patients who received Detrol 2 mg twice daily and 177 patients who received the placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (75%), with the mean age being 60 years of age (range 19-91). At their entrance into the study almost all patients perceived symptoms of urgency (98%) and increased frequency of micturitions (89%) and urge incontinence (83%). These characteristics were balanced across treatment groups for all three studies.
","Side Effects
The most common side effects include, but are not limited to:
dry mouth
dyspepsia
headache
constipation
xerophthalmia (eye disorder that results from a deficiency of vitamin A)
abnormal vision
Many of these side effects are expected of antimuscarinic agents. Detrol is present in the breast milk of nursing mice. It is not known if it is present in the milk of nursing mothers. This drug also causes increased fetal abnormalities in mice. No studies have been done with pregnant mothers. Therefore the drug should only used by pregnant mothers if the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
Detrol is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention, gastric retention, or uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma. Detrol is also contraindicated in patients who have showed hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.
Drug Interactions:

Patients receiving cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors should not receive doses of Detrol greater than 1 mg twice daily. (From FDA Label)
",,"Mechanism of Action
Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. In the anesthetized cat, tolterodine shows a selectivity for the urinary bladder over salivary glands; however, the clinical relevance of this finding has not been established.
After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, a major pharmacologically active metabolite. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite exhibit a high specificity for the muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels.
Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function in healthy volunteers. The main effects following a 6.4-mg single dose of tolterodine were an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure. These findings are consistent with a potent antimuscarinic action on the lower urninary tract. (From FDA Label)"

Nephrology,Doribax (doripenem),"General Information
Doribax is a synthetic, parenteral carbapenem antibiotic. It targets penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) to inhibit the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall.
Doribax is specifically indicated for the treatment of the following infections caused by designated susceptible bacteria: complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis. Doribax is supplied as a solution designed for intravenous infusion. The initial recommended dose of the drug for complicated intra-abdominal infections is 500 mg administered every 8 hours, by intravenous infusion over one hour, in patients 18 years of age or older, for 5 to 14 days. The initial recommended dose of the drug for complicated urinary tract infections is 500 mg administered every 8 hours, by intravenous infusion over one hour, in patients 18 years of age or older, for 10 days. This may be extended to 14 days for patients with concurrent bacteremia.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Doribax was based on the results of four clinical trials.
Complicated intra-abdominal infections
Two identical, multinational, multi-center, randomized, double-blind studies enrolled a total of 946 adult subjects. The subjects received Doribax (500 mg administered over 1 hour every 8 hours) or meropenem (1 g administered over 3-5 minutes every eight hours). Subjects in both treatment arms were given the option to switch to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg twice daily) after a minimum of 3 days of intravenous therapy for a total of 5-14 days of intravenous and oral treatment. Doribax was shown to be non-inferior to meropenem in clinical cure rates 25-45 days post-treatment. In the microbiologically evaluable population enrolled in Study 1, the Doribax clinical cure rate was 82.8% and in the meropenem arm the clinical cure rate was 85.9%, a -3.1 treatment difference. In the microbiologically evaluable population enrolled in the Study 2, the Doribex clinical cure rate was 81% and the meropenem clinical cure rate was 82.1%, a treatment difference of -1.1.
Complicated urinary tract infections
Two multi-center, multinational studies enrolled a total of 1,171 subjects. One study was double-blind and compared Doribax (500 mg administered over 1 hour every eight hours) to IV levofloxacin (250 mg administered every 24 hours). The second study had a similar design but was a non-comparative study. Subjects enrolled in both trials had the option of switching to oral levofloxacin (250 mg every q24h) after a minimum of 3 days of IV therapy for a total of 10 days of treatment. The subjects with confirmed concurrent bacteremia were allowed to receive 500 mg of IV levofloxacin (either IV or oral as appropriate) for a total of 10 to 14 days of treatment. Doribax was non-inferior to levofloxacin with regard to the microbiological eradication rates in microbiologically evaluable (ME) subjects 5-11 days post-treatment. In the microbiologically evaluable population, the eradication rate for the Doribax arm was 82.1% and in the Levofloxacin arm the eradication rate was 83.4%, a -1.3 treatment difference.

Doripenem inactivates multiple essential penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) resulting in inhibition of cell wall synthesis with subsequent cell death. In E. coli and P. aeruginosa, doripenem binds to PBP 2, which is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, as well as to PBPs 3 and 4.

Nephrology,Dutasteride,"General Information
Dutasteride capsules have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate gland. Dutasteride is a dual 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, blocking both type 1 and type 2 5-alpha-reductase isoenzymes. These enzymes are responsible for converting testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the prostate. In turn, high levels of DTH may accumulate and cause hyperplasia.
BPH is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, which can lead to the development of lower urinary tract symptoms. According to the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse, more than half of men in their sixties and as many as 90% in their seventies and eighties have some symptoms of BPH. Symptoms of BPH vary, but can include urination problems such as urgency and leaking or dribbling, or more frequent urination, especially at night.
Clinical Results
Clinical testing for dutasteride included over 4,300 subjects with BPH. Results have demonstrated that the drug provides long lasting symptom relief and positively impacts disease progression.

Nephrology,Eligard (leuprolide acetate),"General Information
Eligard 7.5mg (formerly Leuprogel One-Month Depot) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Eligard (for subcutaneous injection) is designed to deliver 7.5 mg of leuprolide acetate at a controlled rate over a one-month therapeutic period.
Atrix is developing various leuprolide acetate formulations based on the company's Atrigel drug delivery system. The product is injected into the body in a liquid form, where it solidifies and continuously releases a predetermined dose of leuprolide acetate. Sustained levels of leuprolide, a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, decrease testosterone to suppress tumor growth in patients with hormone-responsive prostate cancer.
","Side Effects
Adverse events reported from clinical testing of Eligard include (but are not limited to) the following:
Malaise
Fatigue
Dizziness
Hot flashes/sweats
Gastroenteritis
Colitis
","Additional Information
Sanofi-Synthelabo is Atrix's marketing partner for the Eligard product line. Atrix is developing two additional Eligard products that release leuprolide acetate over a period of three and four months.
For more information on Eligard, please visit Atrix Laboratories.","Mechanism of Action
Leuprolide acetate, an LH-RH agonist, acts as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion when given continuously in therapeutic doses. Animal and human studies indicate that after an initial stimulation, chronic administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. This effect is reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy.
In humans, administration of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in premenopausal females). However, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males, testosterone is reduced to below castrate threshold. These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment. Long-term studies have shown that continuation of therapy with leuprolide acetate maintains testosterone below the castrate level for up to seven years. (from Eligard FDA Label)

The recommended dose of Soliris for pediatrics under the age of 18 years is based on body weight.
The recommended dose of Soliris for gMG and NMSOD consists of: â€¢ 900 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by â€¢ 1200 mg for the fifth dose 1 week later, then â€¢ 1200 mg every 2 weeks thereafter. Administer Soliris at the recommended dosage regimen time points, or within two days of these time points. is 900 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1200 mg for the fifth dose 1 week later, then 1200 mg every 2 weeks thereafter.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Soliris for PNH was based on the results of three clinical trials.
Study 1
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 87 subjects who had received at least four transfusions in the prior 12 months, had a flow cytometric confirmation of at least 10% PNH cells and platelet counts of at least 100,000/microliter. All subjects received meningococcal vaccination prior to treatment. They were subsequently observed to determine the hemoglobin concentration ""set-point"" in order to define each patientâ€™s hemoglobin stabilization and transfusion outcomes. The subjects were then randomized to receive placebo or Soliris, via intravenous infusion over 25 - 45 minutes, at 600 mg every 7 Â± 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 Â± 2 days later, then 900 mg every 14 Â± 2 days for 26 weeks. Primary endpoints included hemoglobin stabilization, the number of RBC units transfused, fatigue, and health-related quality of life. Results revealed that the subjects treated with Soliris had significantly reduced hemolysis compared to placebo (p< 0.001), resulting in improvements in anemia as indicated by increased hemoglobin stabilization and reduced need for RBC transfusions. After 3 weeks of Soliris treatment, patients reported less fatigue and improved health-related quality of life.
Study 2 and extension study
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 97 subjects, 96 of whom completed treatment, who had received at least one transfusion in the prior 24 months and with at least 30,000 platelets/microliter. All subjects received meningococcal vaccination prior to treatment followed by Soliris, via intravenous infusion over 25 - 45 minutes, at 600 mg every 7 Â± 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 Â± 2 days later, then 900 mg every 14 Â± 2 days for 52 weeks. Concomitant medications included anti-thrombotic agents and systemic corticosteroids. The primary endpoints were the same as in study 1. A reduction in intravascular hemolysis, measured by serum LDH levels, was sustained for the treatment period and resulted in a reduced need for RBC transfusion and less fatigue. The long term study enrolled 187 Soliris treated subjects. A reduction in intravascular hemolysis over a total Soliris exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 months was sustained by all the subjects. In addition, there were fewer thrombotic events with Soliris treatment than during the same period of time prior to treatment. The effects of concomitant anticoagulant therapy withdrawal during Soliris therapy was not studied.
The FDA approval of Soliris for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was based on three single-arm studies: two prospective (aHUS Studies 1 and 2) and one retrospective study (aHUS Study 3). In all studies, the dose of Soliris in adult and adolescent patients was 900 mg every 7 days for four weeks, followed by 1200 mg 7 days later, then 1200 mg every 14 days thereafter. The dosage regimen for pediatrics weighing less than 40 kg enrolled in aHUS Study 3 was based on body weight. Efficacy evaluations were based on thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) endpoints. These endpoints included platelet count change from baseline, hematologic normalization, complete TMA response, TMA-event free status and daily TMA intervention rate.
aHUS Resistant to PE/PI (aHUS Study 1)
This trial enrolled 17 subjects who displayed signs of TMA despite receiving at least four PE/PI treatments the week prior to screening. The subjects received Soliris for a minimum of 26 weeks. Soliris reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. The mean platelet count increased from 109 x10(9)/L at baseline to 169 x10(9)/L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count at week 26: 210 x10(9)/L). Renal function, as measured by median eGFR, was improved during Soliris therapy. Four of the five subjects who required dialysis at study entry were able to discontinue dialysis for the duration of Soliris treatment.
aHUS Sensitive to PE/PI (aHUS Study 2)
This trial enrolled 20 subjects undergoing chronic PE/PI who generally did not display hematologic signs of ongoing thrombotic microangiopathy. The subjects received Soliris for a minimum of 26 weeks. Soliris reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. Platelet counts were maintained at normal levels despite the elimination of PE/PI. The mean platelet count was 229 x 10(9)/L at baseline, and 233 x10(9)/L at week 26. Renal function, as measured by median eGFR, was maintained during Soliris therapy.
Retrospective Study in Patients with aHUS (aHUS Study 3)
This trial enrolled 19 pediatrics (ages 2 months to 17 years) who received Soliris for a median duration of 16 weeks. Soliris reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline. Mean platelet count increased from 171 x10(9)/L at baseline to 233 x10(9)/L after one week of therapy; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count at week 26: 254 x10(9)/L). Nine subjects experienced an eGFR improvement of at least 15 mL/min/1.73 m2.
The FDA approval of Soliris for gMG was based on a 26-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. A total of 62 patients were randomized to receive Soliris treatment and 63 were randomized to receive placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was a comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the Myasthenia Gravis-Specific Activities of Daily Living scale (MG-ADL) total score at Week 26. A statistically significant difference favoring Soliris was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in MG-ADL total scores [-4.2 points in the Soliris treated group compared with -2.3 points in the placebo-treated group (p=0.006)].
The FDA approval of Soliris for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive was based on a study of 143 patients who were randomized to receive either Soliris treatment or placebo. Compared to treatment with placebo, the study showed that treatment with Soliris reduced the number of NMOSD relapses by 94 percent over the 48-week course of the trial. Soliris also reduced the need for hospitalizations and the need for treatment of acute attacks with corticosteroids and plasma exchange.

Monitor patients for early signs of meningococcal infections and evaluate immediately if infection is suspected. Soliris is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Soliris or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and generalized Myasthenia Gravis, please visit the Soliris web page.","Mechanism of Action
Soliris is a is a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG2/4 antibody produced by murine myeloma cell culture. A genetic mutation in PNH leads to the generation of abnormal red blood cells (RBCs) that are deficient in terminal complement inhibitors, rendering them sensitive to persistent terminal complement-mediated destruction. The destruction and loss of these RBCs leads to the symptoms associated with PNH. The active ingredient in Soliris, eculizumab, specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. Soliris inhibits terminal complement mediated intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients.

Serotonin plays a role in mediating secretion, motility, inflammation, and sensation of the gastrointestinal tract, and is over-produced in patients with carcinoid syndrome. Through inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase, telotristat and telotristat ethyl reduce the production of peripheral serotonin, and the frequency of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea.

Neurologic Disorders,Firdapse (amifampridine),"General Information
Firdapse (amifampridine) is a potassium channel blocker.
Firdapse is specifically indicated for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in adults.
Fiedapse is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended starting dosage is 15 mg to 30 mg daily, taken orally in divided doses (3 to 4 times daily). The dosage can be increased by 5 mg daily every 3 or 4 days. The maximum recommended total daily dosage is 80 mg. The maximum single dose is 20 mg. If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Firdapse was based on two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled discontinuation studies. A total of 64 adults (age 21 to 88 years) with LEMS were enrolled (Study 1 and Study 2). Patients were required to be on an adequate and stable dosage (30 to 80 mg daily) of amifampridine phosphate prior to entering the randomized discontinuation phases of both studies. The two co-primary measures of efficacy in both studies were the change from baseline to the end of the discontinuation period in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score and in the Subject Global Impression (SGI) score.
Study 1: After an initial open-label run-in phase, 38 patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to either continue treatment with Firdapse (n=16) or to a downward titration to placebo (n=22) over 7 days. Following the downward titration period, patients remained on blinded Firdapse or placebo for 7 more days. Efficacy was assessed at Day 14 of the double-blind period. Patients were allowed to use stable dosages of peripherally acting cholinesterase inhibitors or oral immunosuppressants. Twenty-six percent of patients randomized to Firdapse were receiving cholinesterase inhibitors, versus 36% in the placebo group, and 28% of patients randomized to Firdapse were receiving oral immunosuppressant therapies, versus 34% in the placebo group. During the double-blind period (from Baseline to Day 14), the QMG scores tended to worsen in both treatment groups, but there was significantly greater worsening in the placebo group than in the Firdapse group. Similarly, the SGI score tended to worsen in both treatment groups during the double-blind period, but there was significantly greater worsening in the placebo group than in the Firdapse group. These results indicate that in Study 1, patients randomized to placebo had a significantly greater worsening of muscle weakness and of global impression of the effects of the study treatment on their physical well-being, compared to patients who continued Firdapse in the double-blind period.
Study 2: Patients on stable treatment with Firdapse were randomized 1:1 in a double-blind fashion to either continue treatment with Firdapse (n=13) or change to placebo (n=13) for 4 days. Efficacy was assessed at the end of the 4-day double-blind discontinuation period. Patients were allowed to use stable doses of peripherally acting cholinesterase inhibitors or corticosteroids. From Baseline to Day 4, there was significantly greater worsening in the QMG score in the placebo group than in the Firdapse group, and also significantly greater worsening in the SGI score in the placebo group than in the Firdapse group. These results indicate that in Study 2, patients randomized to placebo had a significantly greater worsening of muscle weakness and of global impression of the effects of the study treatment on their physical well-being, compared to patients who continued Firdapse in the double-blind period.

Neurologic Disorders,Northera (droxidopa),"General Information
Northera (droxidopa) is a synthetic amino acid precursor of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine increases blood pressure by inducing peripheral arterial and venous vasoconstriction.
Northera is specifically indicated for the treatment of orthostatic dizziness or lightheadedness in adult patients with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension caused by primary autonomic failure (Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure), dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency, and non-diabetic autonomic neuropathy.
Northera is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended starting dose is 100 mg three times during the day. It may be titrated by 100 mg three times daily, up to a maximum dose of 600 mg three times daily. Northera should be administered consistently with or without food. To reduce the potential for supine hypertension, elevate the head of the bed and give the last dose at least 3 hours prior to bedtime. The effectiveness of Northera beyond 2 weeks is uncertain, and patients should be evaluated periodically to determine whether Northera is continuing to provide a benefit.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Northera was based on short-term (1 to 2 weeks) and longer-term period (8 weeks; 3 months) studies. Thee studies showed a treatment effect of Northera at Week 1, but none of the studies demonstrated continued efficacy beyond two weeks of treatment.
Study 306B
This was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in subjects with symptomatic NOH and Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Subjects entering the study were required to have a decrease of at least 20 mmHg or 10 mmHg, respectively, in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, within 3 minutes after standing, as well as symptoms associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. The study had an initial dose titration period that lasted up to two weeks in which subjects received placebo or 100 to 600 mg of Northera three times daily, followed by an 8-week treatment period. Efficacy was measured using the OHSA Item #1 score (dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, and feeling like you might black out) at Week 1, in subjects who had completed titration and 1 week of maintenance therapy. A total of 171 subjects were enrolled, and 147 were included in the efficacy analysis. In both groups, the mean baseline dizziness score was 5.1 on an 11-point scale. At Week 1, subjects showed a statistically significant mean 0.9-unit decrease in dizziness with Northera versus placebo (p = 0.028), but the effect did not persist beyond Week 1. Subjects receiving Northera also had a greater increase, compared to placebo, in the Week 1 lowest standing systolic blood pressure within 3 minutes after standing (5.6 mmHg; p = 0.032).
Study 301
This multicenter, multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study included an initial open-label dose titration period, a 7-day washout period, and a randomized double-blind 7-day treatment period. To be eligible for enrollment, subjects were required to have a decrease in systolic or diastolic blood pressure of at least 20 or 10 mmHg, respectively, within 3 minutes after standing. The study was enriched, such that only subjects who had been identified as â€˜respondersâ€™ during the titration period were randomized to Northera or placebo. To be considered a responder, a patient had to demonstrate improvement on the OHSA Item #1 score by at least 1 point, as well as an increase in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg post-standing, during the open-label dose titration period. Efficacy was measured using the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ), a patient reported outcome that measures symptoms of NOH and their impact on the patientâ€™s ability to perform daily activities that require standing and walking. The OHQ includes OHSA Item #1 as one of several components. A statistically significant treatment effect was not demonstrated on OHQ (treatment effect of 0.4 unit, p-value=0.19). The mean baseline dizziness score on OHSA Item #1 (dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, and feeling like you might black out) was 5.2 units on an 11-point scale. At Week 1 of treatment, patients showed a mean 0.7 unit decrease in dizziness with Northera versus placebo (p=0.06).
Study 302 was a placebo-controlled 2-week randomized withdrawal study of Northera in 101 subjects with symptomatic NOH. Study 303 was an extension of studies 301 and 302, where 75 subjects received their titrated dose of Northera for 3 months and then entered a 2-week randomized withdrawal phase. Neither study showed a statistically significant difference between treatment arms on its primary endpoint. Considering these data, the effectiveness of Northera beyond 2 weeks is uncertain, and subjects should be evaluated periodically to determine whether Northera is continuing to provide a benefit.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Northera may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Northera (droxidopa) is a synthetic amino acid analog that is directly metabolized to norepinephrine by dopa-decarboxylase, which is extensively distributed throughout the body. The exact mechanism of action of Northera in the treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is unknown. Northera is believed to exert its pharmacological effects through norepinephrine and not through the parent molecule or other metabolites. Norepinephrine increases blood pressure by inducing peripheral arterial and venous vasoconstriction.

Ruzurgi (amifampridine) is a potassium channel blocker.
Ruzurgi is specifically indicated for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in patients 6 to less than 17 years of age.
Ruzurgi is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is as follows:
Patients 6 to less than 17 years of age and weighing 45 kg or more:
initial dose is 15 to 30 mg daily, in divided doses. Increase daily in 5 to 10 mg increments, divided in up to 5 doses daily
Maximum single dose is 30 mg; maximum daily dose is 100 mg
Patients 6 to less than 17 years and weighing less than 45 kg:
Initial dose is 7.5 to 15 mg daily, in divided doses. Increase daily in 2.5 mg to 5 mg increments, divided in up to 5 doses daily
Maximum single dose is 15 mg; maximum daily dose is 50 mg.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ruzurgi was based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal study of 32 adult patients in which patients were taking Ruzurgi for at least three months prior to entering the study. The study compared patients continuing on Ruzurgi to patients switched to placebo. The primary measure of efficacy was the categorization of the degree of change (e.g., greater than 30% deterioration) in the Triple Timed Up and Go test (3TUG) upon withdrawal of active medication, when compared with the time-matched average of the 3TUG assessments at baseline. The 3TUG is a measure of the time it takes a person to rise from a chair, walk 3 meters, and return to the chair for 3 consecutive laps without pause. Higher 3TUG scores represent greater impairment. None of the patients randomized to continue on Ruzurgi experienced a greater than 30% deterioration in the final post-dose 3TUG test. In contrast, 72% of the patients in the placebo group did experience a greater than 30% deterioration in the final post-dose 3TUG test.

Neurology,Abstral (fentanyl sublingual tablets),"General Information
Abstral is a sublingual tablet formulation of fentanyl citrate, a potent opioid analgesic. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown.
Abstral is specifically indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving, and who are tolerant to, opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain.
Abstral is supplied as a sublingual tablet designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is a single 100 mcg tablet. If adequate analgesia is obtained within 30 minutes of administration of the 100 mcg tablet, continue to treat subsequent episodes of breakthrough pain with this dose. If adequate analgesia is not obtained after the initial dose, the patient may use a second Abstral dose (after 30 minutes) as directed by their health care provider. No more than two doses of Abstral may be used to treat an episode of breakthrough pain. Patients must wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough pain. The Abstral dose should be escalated in a stepwise manner, increased by 100 mcg multiples up to 400 mcg, over consecutive breakthrough episodes until adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects is achieved.
Clinical Results
FDA Approvals
The FDA approval of Abstral was based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 131 subjects experiencing breakthrough cancer pain. Breakthrough cancer pain was defined as a transient flare of moderate-to-severe pain occurring in patients experiencing persistent cancer pain otherwise controlled with maintenance doses of opioid medications. Of the 131 subjects who entered the titration phase of the study, 78 (60%) achieved a successful dose during the titration phase. Sixty-six patients entered the double-blind phase and 60 completed the study. The primary outcome measure, the mean sum of pain intensity difference at 30 minutes (SPID30) for Abstral-treated episodes was statistically significantly higher than for placebo-treated episodes. In a second open-label safety study using an identical titration regimen, 96 of 139 patients (69%) who entered the study titrated to a dose in which the patient obtained adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects during the titration phase.

Neurology,Aggrenox,"General Information
Stroke occurs when blood clots block blood flow to the brain. Aggrenox acts as an antiplatelet, preventing blood platelets from aggregating to form the dangerous clots.
Platelet aggregation is actually a natural process which allows platelet cells to stick together and adhere to the blood vessel wall to prevent excessive blood loss when a blood vessel is damaged. However, for patients who have high-risk of blood clotting, this mechanism can be dangerous. Aggrenox works to prevent the clotting in patients, such as stroke victims, who fall into this high-risk category.
Stroke, the third leading cause of death in the United States, afflicts 730,000 Americans in all and kills approximately 160,000 of those victims each year. Recurrance rate over five years ranges from 30% to nearly 50%, so a drug like Aggrenox which lowers the risk for recurrance is essential.
Clinical Results
Results of the European Stroke Prevention Study 2 (ESPS2), which involved over 6,600 patients, indicated that Aggrenox reduces the risk of recurrent stroke by 37% compared to placebo. Aspirin-only regimens reduced the risk by only 18% as compared to the placebo.
In addition, the results of the study indicated that Aggrenox may reduce risk for secondary stroke more effectively than Clopidogrel, another antiplatelet, although direct- comparison studies between the two drugs have not yet been done.
","Side Effects
Although Aggrenox generally well-tolerated, it was shown to induce headache, bleeding, and gastrointestinal events in some patients undergoing the treatment.
","Additional Information
Recognize the Symptoms of Stroke!
Sudden numbness of face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body
Sudden confusion; trouble speaking or understanding
Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination
Sudden severe headache with no known cause
If you experience any of these symptoms, seek emergency medical attention immediately! Stroke is very serious and can ""cascade"" rapidly, but treatment can be more effective if given quickly.","Mechanism of Action
Aggrenox is an aspirin/extended-release dipyridamole combination that acts on multiple mechanisms of the platelet-aggregation process to prevent clumping and clotting.

Neurology,Aimovig (erenumab-aooe),"General Information
Aimovig (erenumab-aooe) is a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist.
Aimovig is specifically indicated for the preventative treatment of migraine in adults.
Aimovig is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous use. The recommended dosage of Aimovig is 70 mg injected subcutaneously once monthly. Some patients may benefit from a dosage of 140mg injected subcutaneously once monthly, which is administered as two consecutive subcutaneous injections of 70mg each. If a dose of Aimovig is missed, administer as soon as possible. Thereafter, Aimovig can be scheduled monthly from the date of the last dose.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Aimovig as a preventive treatment of episodic or chronic migraine was based on three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: two studies in patients with episodic migraine (4 to 14 migraine days per month)(Study 1 and Study 2) and one study in patients with chronic migraine (â‰¥15 headache days per month with â‰¥8 migraine days per month) (Study 3). The studies enrolled patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura, according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-III) diagnostic criteria.
Study 1 was a randomized, multi-center, 6-month, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating Aimovig for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine. A total of 955 patients with a history of episodic migraine were randomized to receive either Aimovig 70 mg (N = 317), Aimovig 140 mg (N = 319), or placebo (N = 319) by subcutaneous injection once monthly (QM) for 6 months. Patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments including migraine-specific medications (i.e., triptans, ergotamine derivatives) and NSAIDs during the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days over months 4 to 6. Subjects in the erenumab 70 mg and 140 mg treatment arms experienced reductions of 3.2 and 3.7 days from baseline in monthly migraine days, respectively, as compared to a 1.8-day reduction in the placebo arm.
Study 2 was a randomized, multi-center, 3-month, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating Aimovig for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine. A total of 577 patients with a history of episodic migraine were randomized to receive either Aimovig 70 mg (N = 286) or placebo (N = 291) by subcutaneous injection once monthly for 3 months. Patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments including migraine-specific medications (i.e., triptans, ergotamine derivatives) and NSAIDs during the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in monthly migraine days at month 3. The subjects receiving erenumab experienced a statistically significant 2.9-day reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days, as compared to a 1.8-day reduction in the placebo arm.
Study 3 was a randomized, multi-center, 3-month, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating Aimovig as a preventive treatment of chronic migraine. A total of 667 patients with a history of chronic migraine with or without aura were randomized to receive Aimovig 70 mg (N = 191), Aimovig 140 mg (N = 190), or placebo (N = 286) by subcutaneous injections once monthly for 3 months. Patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments including migraine-specific medications (i.e., triptans, ergotamine derivatives) and NSAIDs during the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in monthly migraine days at month 3. The reduction in migraine days was statistically significant for both the 70 mg and 140 mg doses. Patients experienced a 6.6-day reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days in each of the erenumab treatment arms as compared to a 4.2-day reduction in the placebo arm.

Neurology,Amrix (cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended release),"General Information
Amrix (cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride) is a once daily extended release skeletal muscle relaxant which relieves muscle spasm of local origin without interfering with muscle function. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. However, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride is thought to act primarily at brain stem (and to a lesser extent at spinal cord level) to relieve skeletal muscle spasms of local origin without altering muscle function.
Amris is specifically indicated as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions.
Amrix is supplied as 15mg and 30mg capsules for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is one (1) 15 mg capsule taken once daily. Some patients may require up to 30 mg/day, given as one (1) 30 mg capsule taken once daily or as two (2) 15 mg capsules taken once daily. It is recommended that doses be taken at approximately the same time each day. Use of Amrix for periods longer than two or three weeks is not recommended.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Amrix was based on the results of two identical double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies: Study 1105 evaluated 30 mg of Amrix and Study 1106 studied 15 mg of Amrix both taken once daily for 14 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the patientâ€™s rating of medication helpfulness, measured at Day 4 and Day 14, between the two Amrix arms versus placebo. The primary endpoint was reached with signifcance for both Amrix arms. In addition, one of the two studies demonstrated significant differences between the Amrix 30 mg group and the placebo group in terms of patient-rated relief from local pain due to muscle spasm at Day 4 and Day 8, in subject-rated restriction of movement at Day 4 and Day 8, and in patient-rated global impression of change at Day 4, Day 8, and Day 14.

Neurology,Apokyn (apomorphine hydrochloride),"General Information
Apokyn (apomorphine) is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist. Formulations of apomorphine have been available since the 1970s in Europe and Canada, but Apokyn represents the first time any drug containing apomorphine has been approved for use in the US. It is indicated for the treatment of motor symptoms associated with late stage Parkinson's Disease.
It is specifically indicated for the acute, intermittent treatment of hypomobility, ""off"" episodes (""end-of-dose wearing off"" and unpredictable ""on/off"" episodes) associated with advanced Parkinsonâ€™s disease, as adjunct/supplemental therapy to standard levodopa therapy. It is the first treatment approved for this indication in the US.
The recommended subcutaneous dose of Apokyn is 0.2 to 0.6 mL subcutaneously during acute hypomobility episodes, delivered via metered injector pen. Average dosing frequency during study was thrice daily, with a maximum studied regimen of 0.6 mL five times daily. Recommended application is to a pinch of skin on the upper arm, thigh or abdomen.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Apokyn for the treatment of acute Parkinsonian hypomobility was based on three randomized, controlled studies, enrolling a total of 108 subjects, all of whom had advanced Parkinson's disease (mean disease duration = 11.3 years) and were being treated with L-dopa and at least one other agent, usually a dopamine agonist. Improvement in motor function on the Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was the primary endpoint of all three studies. The trials enrolled a combined total of 108 subjects, including 29 (one trial) who had never received apomorphine products (the remaining 79 subjects had experience internationally with apomorphine). Results showed that Apokyn was significantly efficacious in ending hypomotor episodes and markedly impoving UPDRS motor scores (> 20 points mean improvement for all trials) 20 minutes after dosing, compared with placebo (p<0.0001 for all trials). 98% of all trial subjects began antiemetic treatment with Tigan (trimethobenzamide) 3 days prior to treatment; roughly 50% were able to eventually disontinue Tigan while continuing Apokyn treatment (mean time to discontinuation = 2 months).
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Apokyn may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Yawning
Dyskinesias
Drowsiness/Somnolence
Dizziness/Postural Hypotension
Rhinorrhea
Hallucinations
Edema/Inflammation
In addition, Apokyn has been associated with a very high incidence on mild-to-moderate treatment-responsive nausea and/or vomiting, especially early in treatment while the subject is still acclimating to Apokyn. It is recommended that subjects begin antiemetic treatment with or just prior to treatment with Apokyn, and continue for as long as needed.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Apokyn or hypomotor symptoms of advanced Parkinson's Disease, please contact the Apokyn Web Site","Mechanism of Action
Apokyn injection delivers apomorphine hydrochloride hemihydrate, a non-ergoline dopamine agonist with high selectivity for the dopamine D4, D2, D3, D5 and adrenergic alpha-1D, alpha-2B, alpha-2C receptors, all of which are broadly associated with the promotion of motor function. The precise mechanism of action of Apokyn as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown, although it is believed to be due to stimulation of post-synaptic D2 receptors within the caudate putamen, a brain stucture which supports motor function. Subcutaneous administration provides rapid, controlled systemic delivery, with linear pharmacokinetics over a doses ranging of 2 to 8 mg.

Neurology,Aptiom (eslicarbazepine acetate),"General Information
Aptiom (eslicarbazepine acetate) is a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker. The precise mechanism(s) by which eslicarbazepine exerts anticonvulsant activity is unknown.
Aptiom is specifically indicated as adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures.
Aptiom is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is 400 mg once daily. After one week, increase dosage to 800 mg once daily (recommended maintenance dosage). Maximum recommended maintenance dosage is 1200 mg once daily (after a minimum of one week at 800 mg once daily).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Aptiom was based on three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials in adults with epilepsy (Studies 1, 2, and 3). Enrolled subjects had partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization and were not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs. Studies 1 and 2 compared dosages of Aptiom 400, 800, and 1200 mg once daily with placebo. Study 3 compared dosages of Aptiom 800 and 1200 mg once daily with placebo. In all three trials, following an 8Â­week Baseline Phase, which established a baseline seizure frequency, subjects were randomized to a treatment arm. The trials consisted of a treatment period consisting of an initial titration phase (2 weeks), and a subsequent maintenance phase (12 weeks). The specific titration schedule differed amongst the three studies. Thus, subjects were started on a daily dose of 400 mg or 800 mg and subsequently increased by 400 mg/day following one or two weeks, until the final daily target dose was achieved. The primary endpoint was the standardized seizure frequency during the Maintenance Phase over 28 days. The Aptiom treatment at 400 mg/day , in Studies 1 and 2, did not show significant treatment effect. A statistically significant effect was observed with Aptiom treatment at doses of 800 mg/day in Studies 1 and 2 but not in Study 3, and at doses of 1200 mg/day in all three studies.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Aptiom may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Neurology,ARICEPT (donepezil hydrochloride),"General Information
Aricept has been approved for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Aricept is effective in improving cognition and patient function in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease.
Clinical Results
Controlled clinical trials in over 900 subjects demonstrated that more than 80% of subjects taking Aricept either improved or exhibited no further demonstration in tests of cognition over the course of the studies. In an assessment of patient function, which includes general function, cognition, behavior and activities of daily living, clinicians rated approximately two times as many subjects on Aricept as improved in comparison to placebo after 24 weeks of treatment.
",,,"Mechanism of Action
Aricept is a new reversible inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme, which breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Aricept may allow a greater concentration of acetylcholine in the brain, thereby improving cholinergic function. Acetylcholine, associated with memory and learning, is in short supply in subjects with Alzheimer's disease."
Neurology,Aristada (aripiprazole lauroxil) extended-release injectable,"General Information
Aristada (aripiprazole lauroxil) is an atypical antipsychotic.
Aristada is specifically indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
Aristada is supplied as a solution for intramuscular administration. For patients who have never taken aripiprazole, establish tolerability with oral aripiprazole prior to initiating treatment with Aristada. Due to the half-life of oral aripiprazole, it may take up to 2 weeks to fully assess tolerability. Depending on individual patientâ€™s needs, treatment with Aristada can be initiated at a dose of 441 mg, 662 mg or 882 mg administered monthly, which corresponds to 300 mg, 450 mg and 600 mg of aripiprazole, respectively. Treatment may also be initiated with the 882 mg dose every 6 weeks. Administer Aristada either in the deltoid muscle (441 mg dose only) or gluteal muscle (441 mg, 662 mg or 882 mg).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Aristada was based, in part, on the basis of efficacy data from trials with the oral formulation of aripiprazole. In addition, the efficacy of Aristada was established in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study in adult patients with schizophrenia meeting DSM-IV TR criteria [Study 1, n = 622; 207 (Aristada 441 mg), 208 (Aristada 882 mg), and 207 (placebo)]. After establishing tolerability to oral aripiprazole, patients received oral aripiprazole or placebo daily for the first 3 weeks. The intramuscular (IM) injections were administered on Days 1, 29 and 57. Efficacy was assessed using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the primary endpoint, and Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I), the secondary endpoint. Statistically significant separation from placebo on PANSS total score change was observed in each Aristada dose group. The secondary efficacy endpoint was defined as the CGI-I score at Day 85. Both Aristada treatment groups demonstrated statistically significantly better CGI-I scores versus placebo.
","Side Effects
The most common adverse event associated with the use of Aristada was akathisia.
Aristada comes with a black box warning of increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Aristada is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis
","Additional Information

Aristada (aripiprazole lauroxil) is an atypical antipsychotic. Following intramuscular injection, Aristada is likely converted by enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole, which is then hydrolyzed to aripiprazole. The mechanism of action of aripiprazole in the body is unknown. However, efficacy could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity D2 and 5Â­ HT1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors.

Neurology,Austedo (deutetrabenazine),"General Information
Austedo (deutetrabenazine) is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor.
Austedo is specifically indicated for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntingtonâ€™s disease and tardive dyskinesia in adults.
Austedo is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is as follows:
Huntingtonâ€™s disease chorea: The dose of Austedo is determined individually for each patient based on reduction of chorea and tolerability. When first prescribed to patients who are not being switched from tetrabenazine (a related VMAT2 inhibitor), the recommended starting dose of Austedo is 6 mg administered orally once daily. The dose of Austedo may be increased at weekly intervals in increments of 6 mg per day to a maximum recommended daily dosage of 48 mg. Administer total daily dosages of 12 mg or above in two divided doses.
Tardive dyskinesia: Initial dose: 12 mg/day; Recommended dose: 12 mgâ€“ 48 mg/day; Maximum dose: 48 mg/day
Administer Austedo with food. Swallow Austedo whole. Do not chew, crush, or break tablets. Please see drug label for dosing recommendations in patients switching from tetrabenazine and other dose adjustments.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Chorea associated with Huntingtonâ€™s disease: The FDA approval of Austedo was based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial conducted in 90 ambulatory patients with manifest chorea associated with Huntingtonâ€™s disease. Treatment duration was 12 weeks, including an 8-week dose titration period and a 4-week maintenance period, followed by a 1-week washout. Austedo was started at 6 mg per day and titrated upward, at weekly intervals, in 6 mg increments until satisfactory treatment of chorea was achieved, intolerable side effects occurred, or until a maximal dose of 48 mg per day was reached. The primary efficacy endpoint was the Total Maximal Chorea Score, an item of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). On this scale, chorea is rated from 0 to 4 (with 0 representing no chorea) for 7 different parts of the body. The total score ranges from 0 to 28. Total Maximal Chorea Scores for patients receiving Austedo improved by approximately 4.4 units from baseline to the maintenance period (average of Week 9 and Week 12), compared to approximately 1.9 units in the placebo group. The treatment effect of -2.5 units was statistically significant (p<0.0001).
Tardive Dyskinesia: The FDA approval was based on two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trials conducted in 335 adult ambulatory patients with tardive dyskinesia caused by use of dopamine receptor antagonists. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) was the primary efficacy measure for the assessment of tardive dyskinesia severity. In Study 1, a 12-week, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trial, 222 adults with tardive dyskinesia were randomized 1:1:1:1 to 12 mg Austedo, 24 mg Austedo, 36 mg Austedo, or placebo. Treatment duration included a 4-week dose escalation period and an 8-week maintenance period followed by a 1-week washout. The dose of Austedo was started at 12 mg per day and increased at weekly intervals in 6 mg/day increments to a dose target of 12 mg, 24 mg or 36 mg per day. In Study 1, the AIMS total score for patients receiving Austedo demonstrated statistically significant improvement, from baseline to Week 12, of 3.3 and 3.2 units for the 36 mg and 24 mg arms, respectively, compared with 1.4 units in placebo. In Study 2, a 12-week, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose trial, adults with tardive dyskinesia (n=113) received daily doses of placebo or Austedo, starting at 12 mg per day with increases allowed in 6-mg increments at 1-week intervals until satisfactory control of dyskinesia was achieved, until intolerable side effects occurred, or until a maximal dose of 48 mg per day was reached. Treatment duration included a 6-week dose titration period and a 6-week maintenance period followed by a 1-week washout. Patients were titrated to an optimal dose over 6 weeks. The average dose of Austedo after treatment was 38.3 mg per day. In Study 2, AIMS total score for patients receiving Austedo demonstrated statistically significant improvement by 3.0 units from baseline to endpoint (Week 12), compared with 1.6 units in the placebo group with a treatment effect of -1.4 units.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Austedo may include, but are not limited to, the following:
somnolence
diarrhea
dry mouth
fatigue
Austedo comes with the following Black Box Warning: Austedo can increase the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior (suicidality) in patients with Huntingtonâ€™s disease. Anyone considering the use of Austedo must balance the risks of depression and suicidality with the clinical need for treatment of chorea. Closely monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the risk of depression and suicidality and should be instructed to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician.

Austedo (deutetrabenazine) is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor. The precise mechanism by which Austedo (deutetrabenazine) exerts its anti-chorea effects is unknown but is believed to be related to its effect as a reversible depletor of monoamines (such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine) from nerve terminals. The major circulating metabolites (Î±-dihydrotetrabenazine [HTBZ] and Î²-HTBZ) of deutetrabenazine, are reversible inhibitors of VMAT2, resulting in decreased uptake of monoamines into synaptic vesicles and depletion of monoamine stores.

Neurology,Avinza (morphine sulfate),"General Information
Avinza was approved by the FDA in March 2002 for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain in patients that require continuous, around-the-clock therapy for an extended period of time. A once-daily dose of Avinza in the extended release capsule formulation provides relief from pain for a 24-hour period. Avinza is available in 30, 60, 90 and 120 mg capsules.
This product was developed by Elan Corporation and will be marketed in the U.S. and Canada by Ligand Pharmaceuticals.
Clinical Results
Controlled and open-label clinical trials were conducted to test the safety and efficacy of Avinza. A total of approximately 140 healthy subjects and 560 subjects with chronic, moderate-to-severe pain from malignant and non-malignant disease sources were involved in these studies. The duration of the controlled clinical studies ranged from seven days to up to four weeks. Subjects in the open-label studies were observed for six to 12 months.
In one study, 295 subjects with chronic pain from osteoarthritis received either placebo or once-daily treatment with Avinza 30 mg in the morning or evening. Results showed that Avinza was significantly more effective at reducing pain than placebo.
Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that the amount of morphine absorbed from Avinza extended-release formulation was similar to that absorbed from other oral morphine formulations. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of Avinza were shown to be dose-proportional for both healthy subjects and subjects with moderate-to-severe pain.
","Side Effects
The most common side effects reported by subjects in clinical trials were:

Neurology,Axert (almotriptan malate) tablets,"General Information
Axert has been approved by the FDA for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Axert belongs to a class of drugs known as selective serotonin receptor agonists. These drugs target serotonin receptors and act against migraine headaches by inducing the constriction of blood vessels surrounding the brain.
Migraine attacks are characterized by severe unilateral head pain, which lasts between four and 72 hours. Attacks are often are accompanied by nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light and/or sound. Approximately 28 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches, with women experiencing migraines at least three times more often than men. For many sufferers, these headaches have a significant impact on their quality of life.
Pharmacia plans to market Axert in the United States under a licensing agreement with Almirall Prodesfarma, SA, Spain. The drug is also approved in the European Union.
Clinical Results
Results of controlled clinical trials demonstrated that Axert was highly effective and well tolerated. Data showed that Axert (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg) produced significant relief from migraine headache pain at two hours, with efficacy rates ranging from 57% to 65% (12.5 mg) and 55% to 56% (6.25 mg) compared to placebo.
","Side Effects
Side effects associated with the use of Axert include (but are not limited to) the following:
Nausea
Sleepiness
Paresthesia (tingling or numbness)
Dry mouth
Headache
In controlled trials, Axert showed a low percentage of side effects characteristic of triptans. However, this class of compounds has the potential to cause coronary vasospasm, and as a result Axert is not advised for patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease.
","Additional Information
For additional information on Axert, please visit Pharmacia or the Axert web site.
More information on migraine headaches can be found at the National Headache Foundation.","Mechanism of Action
Axert Tablets contain almotriptan malate, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D (5-HT 1B/1D) receptor agonist. Almotriptan binds with high affinity to 5-HT 1D, 5-HT 1B and 5-HT 1F receptors. Almotriptan has weak affinity for 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 7 receptors, but has no significant affinity or pharmacological activity at 5-HT 2, 5-HT 3, 5-HT 4, 5-HT 6; alpha or beta adrenergic; adenosine (A1, A2); angiotensin (AT 1, AT 2); dopamine (D1, D2); endothelin (ET A, ET B); or tachykinin (NK 1, NK 2, NK 3) binding sites.
Current theories on the etiology of migraine headache suggest that symptoms are due to local cranial vasodilation and/or to the release of vasoactive and pro-inflammatory peptides from sensory nerve endings in an activated trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of almotriptan in migraine can most likely be attributed to agonist effects at 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on the extracerebral, intracranial blood vessels that become dilated during a migraine attack, and on nerve terminals in the trigeminal system. Activation of these receptors results in cranial vessel constriction, inhibition of neuropeptide release and reduced transmission in trigeminal pain pathways. (from Axert Prescribing Information)

Neurology,Banzel (rufinamide),"General Information
Banzel is a triazole derivative. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. However, it is thought that rufinamide modulates the activity of sodium channels and, in particular, prolongation of the inactive state of the channel.
Banzel is specifically indicated for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children 4 years and older and adults.
Banzel is supplied as a 200mg or 400mg tablet for oral administration.
The recommended initial dose of the drug for pediatrics aged four years and older with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a daily dose of approximately 10 mg/kg/day administered in two equally divided doses. The dose should be increased by approximately 10 mg/kg increments every other day to a target dose of 45 mg/kg/day or 3200 mg/day, whichever is less, administered in two equally divided doses.
The recommended initial dose of the drug for adults with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a daily dose of 400 to 800 mg/day administered in two equally divided doses. The dose should be increased by 400 to 800 mg/day every 2 days until a maximum daily dose of 3200 mg/day, administered in two equally divided doses is reached.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Banzel was based on the results of a single clinical trial. This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study enrolled 138 subjects, between 4 and 30 years of age, with inadequately controlled seizures associated with LGS. All subjects were being treated with 1 to 3 concomitant stable dose anti-epileptic drugs. After completing a 4-week baseline phase on stable therapy, the subjects were randomized to have Banzel or placebo added to their ongoing therapy during a 12 week double-blind phase. This double-blind phase consisted of two periods: the Titration Period (1 to 2 weeks) and the Maintenance Period (10 weeks). During the Titration Period, the dose was increased to a target dosage of approximately 45 mg/kg/day (3200 mg in adults of > 70kg), given on a twice daily schedule. Final doses at titration were to remain stable during the maintenance period. The median percentage reduction in total seizure frequency from baseline was greater in the rufinamide therapy group than in the placebo group (32.7% versus 11.7%; p<0.002). The rufinamide-treated subjects had 42.5% median percentage reduction in tonic-atonic seizure (drop attack) frequency per 28 days from baseline as compared with 1.4% increase in the placebo-treated subjects (p<0.0001). The rufinamide group had a statistically significant improvement in seizure severity (p<0.005) and a higher percentage of subjects who experienced at least a 50% reduction in tonic-atonic seizure frequency per 28 days compared with placebo (42.5% versus 16.7; p=0.002).

Two of these studies demonstrated efficacy in patients with low back pain. One study in low back pain did not show a statistically significant pain reduction for Belbuca compared to placebo.
12-Week Study in Opioid-NaÃ¯ve Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain
A total of 749 patients with chronic low back pain entered an open-label, dose-titration period for up to eight weeks. Patients initiated therapy with a single 75 mcg dose of Belbuca on Day 1 and continued taking Belbuca 75 mcg either once daily or every 12 hours for 4-8 days as tolerated. The dose was then increased to 150 mcg every 12 hours, and patients could continue to dose escalate in 150 mcg dose increments every 4-8 days for up to 6 weeks if the adverse effects were tolerable and the analgesic effects were not adequate. Patients who achieved adequate analgesia and tolerable adverse effects on Belbuca for at least 2 weeks were then randomized to continue their titrated dose of Belbuca or matching placebo. Sixty-one percent (61%) of the patients who entered the open-label dose titration period were able to titrate to a tolerable and effective dose and were randomized into a 12-week, double-blind treatment period.
During the first 2 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients were allowed up to 2 tablets per day of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg as supplemental analgesia to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in patients randomized to placebo. Thereafter, the supplemental analgesia was limited to 1 to 2 tablets of acetaminophen 500 mg per day. Seventy-six percent of the patients treated with Belbuca completed the 12-week treatment compared to 73% of the patients treated with placebo. Of the 209 patients randomized to Belbuca, 4% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 8% due to adverse events. Of the 211 patients randomized to placebo, 11% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 4% due to adverse events.
Of the patients who were randomized, the mean pain (SD) scores on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) were 7.1 (1.06) and 7.2 (1.05) prior to open-label titration and 2.8 (1.01) and 2.8 (1.12) at the beginning of the double-blind period for Belbuca and placebo, respectively. The change from double-blind baseline to week 12 in mean pain (SD) NRS score was statistically significant favoring patients treated with Belbuca, compared with patients treated with placebo. A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (62%) had at least a 30% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint when compared to patients who received placebo buccal film (47%). A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (41%) also had at least a 50% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint compared to patients who received placebo (33%).
12-Week Study in Opioid-Experienced Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain
Eight hundred and ten (810) patients on chronic opioid therapy (total daily dose 30-160 mg in oral morphine sulfate equivalents (MSE) for at least 4 weeks) entered an open-label, dose-titration period with Belbuca for up to 8 weeks, following taper of their prior opioids to 30 mg oral MSE daily. Patients were initiated with Belbuca150 mcg every 12 hours if they were on 30 to 89 mg oral MSE daily and 300 mcg every 12 hours if they were on 90 to160 mg oral MSE daily prior to taper. If a patient tolerated the adverse events and the analgesic effects were not adequate, the dose was increased in increments of 150 mcg every 12 hours after 4 to 8 days for up to 6 weeks. Patients were permitted to take hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg as analgesic rescue as needed up to a maximum of 4 doses per day during the open-label dose titration period. After a dose was reached with adequate analgesia and tolerable adverse effects for a period of 2 weeks, patients were randomized to continue their titrated dose of Belbuca or matching placebo. Sixty-three percent (63%) of the patients who entered the open-label titration period were able to titrate to a tolerable and effective dose and were randomized into a 12-week double-blind treatment phase. Ten percent (10%) of patients discontinued due to an adverse event, 8% discontinued due to lack of a therapeutic effect, and 0.1% discontinued due to opioid withdrawal during the open-label titration period. The remaining 20% of patients discontinued due to various non drug related administrative reasons.
During the double-blind period, patients were permitted to take up to 2 doses of 5/325 mg or 10/650 mg of hydrocodone/acetaminophen per day for the first 2 weeks to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in patients randomized to placebo. After the first 2 weeks, patients were permitted to take 1 dose of 5/325 mg or 10/650 mg per day. Eighty-three percent of patients treated with Belbuca and 57% of patients treated with placebo buccal film completed the 12-week treatment period. Of the 243 patients randomized to Belbuca, 8% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 2% due to adverse events. Of the 248 patients randomized to placebo buccal film, 25% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 5% due to adverse events.
Of the patients who were randomized into the double-blind period, the mean pain (SD) NRS scores were 6.8 (1.28) and 6.6 (1.32) prior to open-label titration and 2.9 (0.985) and 2.8 (1.05) at the beginning of the double-blind period for Belbuca and placebo, respectively. The change from baseline to week 12 in mean pain (SD) NRS score was statistically significant in favor of patients treated with Belbuca compared with patients treated with placebo. A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (64%) had at least a 30% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint when compared to patients who received placebo buccal film (31%). A higher proportion of Belbuca patients (39%) also had at least a 50% reduction in pain score from prior to open-label titration to study endpoint compared to patients who received placebo (17%).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Belbuca may include, but are not limited to, the following:
nausea
constipation

Neurology,Belsomra (suvorexant),"General Information
Belsomra (suvorexant) is an orexin receptor antagonist. The orexin neuropeptide signaling system is a central promoter of wakefulness. Blocking the orexin receptor suppresses wakefulness.
Belsomra is specifically indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance.
Belsomra is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is 10 mg, taken no more than once per night and within 30 minutes of going to bed, with at least 7 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening. If the 10 mg dose is well-tolerated but not effective, the dose can be increased. The maximum recommended dose of Belsomra is 20 mg once daily.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Belsomra was based on three clinical trials in patients with insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and sleep maintenance.
Two similarly designed, 3-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies were conducted (Study 1 and Study 2). In both studies, non-elderly (age 18-64) and elderly (age â‰¥ 65) patients were randomized separately. For the studies together, non-elderly adults were treated with Belsomra 20 mg or placebo. Elderly patients were treated with Belsomra 15 mg or placebo. In Study 1 and Study 2, Belsomra 15 mg or 20 mg was superior to placebo for sleep latency as assessed both objectively by polysomnography and subjectively by patient-estimated sleep latency. Belsomra 15 mg or 20 mg was also superior to placebo for sleep maintenance, as assessed both objectively by polysomnography and subjectively by patient-estimated total sleep time. The effects of Belsomra at night 1 (objective) and week 1 (subjective) were generally consistent with later time points.
In a 1-month crossover study (Study 3), non-elderly adults (age 18-64 years, mean age 44 years) were treated with placebo and Belsomra at a dose of 10 mg, 20 mg or up to 80 mg. Belsomra 10 mg and 20 mg were superior to placebo for sleep latency and sleep maintenance, as assessed objectively by polysomnography.
","Side Effects
The most common adverse effect associated with the use of Belsomra is somnolence
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Belsomra or insomnia, please visit www.belsomra.com","Mechanism of Action
Belsomra (suvorexant) a highly selective antagonist for orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R. The mechanism by which suvorexant exerts its therapeutic effect in insomnia is presumed to be through antagonism of orexin receptors. The orexin neuropeptide signaling system is a central promoter of wakefulness. Blocking the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to receptors OX1R and OX2R is thought to suppress wake drive. Antagonism of orexin receptors may also underlie potential adverse effects such as signs of narcolepsy/cataplexy.

Autonomic neuropathy,Lyrica (pregabalin),"General Information
Lyrica (pregabalin) is a modulator of voltage-gated calcium channels, designed to affect neurological transmission in multiple systems.
Lyrica is specifically indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury. It is also indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, for postherpetic neuralgia, for fibromyalgia, and as an adjunctive therapy for adults with partial onset seizures.
Lyrica is supplied as a hard-gelatin capsule for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury is 150 mg/day (75 mg twice/day), which can be escalated to 300 mg/day within the first week. The maximum dosing regimen is 600 mg/day.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Lyrica for neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury was based on the results of two randomized, double-blind, flexibly dosed (150-600 mg/day), placebo-controlled trials. Subjects were enrolled with baseline pain scores of at least four on a scale of zero (no pain) to eleven (worst pain), and were permitted to continue taking other pain medications, including NSAIDs, opioids and non-opioids. The total enrollment was 357 subjects. The first study was 12 weeks in duration and consisted of a 3Â­week dose adjustment phase and a 9-week dose maintenance phase in subjects with neuropathic pain from traumatic spinal cord injuries. The second study was 16 weeks in duration and consisted of a 4-week dose adjustment phase and a 12-week dose maintenance phase in subjects with neuropathic pain from non-traumatic spinal cord injuries. In both trials, Lyrica treatment statistically significantly improved the endpoint weekly mean pain score, and increased the number of subjects with at least a 30% and 50% reduction in pain score from baseline compared to placebo. Some subjects observed a decrease in pain within the first week of treatment with a sustained improvement throughout the studies.
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions associated with the use of Lyrica may include, but are not limited to, the following:

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Lyrica or neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury, please visit the Lyrica web page.","Mechanism of Action
Lyrica (pregabalin) binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. While the complete mechanism of action is not entirely understood, studies in animal models of nerve damage have shown Lyrica to reduce calcium-dependent release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters in the spinal cord, possibly by disrupting alpha2-delta containing-calcium channel trafficking and/or reducing calcium currents. Other animal models of nerve damage and persistent pain suggest the anti-nociceptive activities of pregabalin may also be mediated through interactions with descending noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways originating from the brainstem that modulate pain transmission in the spinal cord.

On conclusion of Lyrica therapy, dosing should be tapered over at least 1 week.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Neuropathic Pain associated with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy
Approval of Lyrica for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy was based on results of 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trials. Two of these studies investigated the maximum recommended dose of the drug:
Study DPN 1: This study enrolled 337 patients, who were randomized to receive one of 3 doses of the drug (25 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg; n=240) or placebo (n=97) thrice daily for 5 weeks. Trial data indicated that the two higher doses of the drug produced significant improvements in mean pain score and increases in the portion of patients achieving a reduction in mean pain score of 50% or greater, compared to placebo. There was no significant difference in efficacy between the two higher doses, though incidence of adverse events was seen to be dose dependent.
Study DPN2: This study enrolled 146 patients, who received either 100 mg Lyrica thrice daily (n=76) or placebo (n=70) for 8 weeks. Trial data indicated that the drug produced significant improvements in mean pain score and increases in the portion of patients achieving a reduction in mean pain score of 50% or greater, compared to placebo. Reductions in pain for some subjects were observed as early as week 1.
Postherpetic Neuralgia
Approval of Lyrica for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia was based on three double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies:
Study PHN1: This trial enrolled 368 patients, who received one of three doses of Lyrica (75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg; n=275) or placebo (n=93) twice daily for 13 weeks. Randomization was based on creatinine clearance rate: subjects with clearance between 30 ml/min and 60 ml/min received 75 mg, 150 mg, or placebo twice daily; while subjects with clearance >60 ml/min were randomized to 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg or placebo twice daily. Subjects with high creatinine clearance achieved significant improvements in mean pain score, and a significantly greater portion of these patients achieved reductions of >50% from baseline. Subjects with lower creatinine clearance experienced a higher rate of adverse events, including events leading to treatment discontinuation.
Study PHN2: This trial enrolled 173 patients, who received one of two doses of Lyrica (100 mg or 200 mg; n=89) or placebo (n=84) thrice daily for 8 weeks. As with Study PHN1, patients were stratified by creatinine clearance rate (30 ml/min to 60 ml/min: 100 mg or placebo; 60+ ml/min: 200 mg or placebo). At both doses, the drug significantly improved mean pain score and increased the portion of patients experiencing a decrease in score of at least 50%. Some patients experienced persistent improvements as early as week 1.
Study PHN3: This trial enrolled 238 patients, who received one of two doses of Lyrica (50 mg or 100 mg) or placebo thrice daily for 8 weeks. Both doses produced significant improvements in mean main score and increased the portion of patients who achieved a 50% or greater reduction in score from baseline, vs. placebo. Patients with lower creatinine clearance rates (30 mg/ml to 60 mg/ml) experienced significantly more treatment-related adverse events than higher clearance patients, including more adverse events warranting discontinuation of treatment.
Epilepsy
Approval of Lyrica for the adjunctive treatment of epilepsy was based on results of three 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials, which enrolled patients whose disease was not adequately controlled with 1-3 concomitant anti-epileptic drugs:
Study E1: This trial enrolled 453 patients, who received one of four doses of the drug (25 mg, n=88; 75 mg, n=86; 150 mg, n=90; or 300 mg, n=89) or placebo (n=100) twice daily. All doses of the drug produced reductions in seizure frequency from baseline, and the magnitude of improvement was seen to be dose related. This reduction was non-significant for the lowest dose (-9%, p=0.4230), but was significant for the three other doses (-35%, p=0.0001; -37%, p=0.0001; -51%, p=0.0001, respectively) vs. placebo. The three higher doses also produced significant improvement in one of the trialâ€™s key secondary endpoints, significantly and dose-dependently increasing the portion of patients experiencing a reduction in seizure frequency of at least 50% (31%, 40% and 51%, respectively).
Study E2: This trial enrolled 287 subjects who received one of two doses of the drug (50 mg, n=99; or 200 mg, n=92) or placebo (n=96) thrice daily. Both doses produced significant reductions in median seizure frequency from baseline, relative to placebo (-17%, p=0.0007; -43%, p=0.0001, respectively).
Study E3: This trial enrolled 312 patients, who received one of two doses of the drug (300 mg twice daily, n=103; or 200 mg thrice daily, n=111) or placebo (n=98). Both drugs significantly reduced median seizure frequency from baseline, vs. placebo (-36%, p=0.0001; -48%, p=0.0001, respectively). The difference in improvement between the two Lyrica doses was non-significant. Both doses also produced significant improvement in one of the trialâ€™s key secondary endpoints, significantly increasing the portion of patients experiencing a reduction in seizure frequency of at least 50% (43% and 49%, respectively).

Dizziness
Somnolence
Peripheral Edema
Diplopia
Dry Mouth
Tremor
Abnormal Thinking
Infection
Headache
Pain
Asthenia
Ataxia
Blurry Vision
Constipation
Edema
In addition, Lyrica is a Schedule V controlled substance. Studies of the drug in recreational users of sedative/hypnotic drugs indicated subjective psychoactive effects of a magnitude similar to the benzodiazepine diazepam. Roughly 4% of subjects reported eurphoria as an adverse event in trials, compared to 1% for placebo; some sub-populations reported euphoria rates as high as 12%. In addition, abrupt termination of treatment was associated with insomnia, nausea, headache and/or diarrhea. Patients receiving Lyrica should be monitored closely for evidence of dependence, misuse or abuse.
Use of Lyrica has been associated with creatine kinase elevations, including mean maximum elevations of 60 U/l. 2% of subjects experienced creatine kinase levels greater that 3x the upper limit of normal, and 3 patients reported rhabdomyolysis during clinical trials. Patients should be advised to promptly consult a healthcare professional if they experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if these muscle symptoms are accompanied by malaise or fever. Treatment should be discontinued if significant creatine kinase elevations are noted.
Use of Lyrica has also been associated with weight gain. This weight gain was not limited to patients experiencing drug-related edema, and it did not appear to be influenced by age, gender, or baseline BMI. The drug did not appear to cause loss of glycemic control in diabetic patients. The long term effects of Lyrica-mediated weight gain (if any) have not been characterized.
Dizziness and somnolence occur regularly with Lyrica administration. Patients are advised to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking the drug.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Lyrica, neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, or epilepsy, please visit the Lyrica web page.","Mechanism of Action
The exact mechanism of Lyrica's action has not been fully characterized. Lyrica binds to the alpha2-delta auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. Blockade of these channels has been shown to inhibit the calcium-dependent release of a number of neurotransmitters. The drug is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, though it does not bind directly to GABAa, GABAb, or benzodiazepine receptors, does not augment GABAa responses in cultured neurons, does not alter rat brain GABA concentration or have acute effects on GABA uptake or degradation. In cultured neurons prolonged application of pregabalin increased the density of GABA transporter protein and increased the rate of functional GABA transport. The drug does not achieve its antinociceptive or antiseizure activity through blockade of sodium channels, activation of opioid receptors, alteration of cyclooxygenase enzyme activity, through activity at serotonin and dopamine receptors, or through effect on dopamine, serotonin, or noradrenaline reuptake.

Autonomic neuropathy,Onpattro (patisiran),"General Information
Onpattro (patisiran) contains a transthyretin-directed small interfering RNA. Onpattro utilizes a novel approach to target and reduce production of the TTR protein in the liver via the RNAi pathway. Reducing the TTR protein leads to a reduction in the amyloid deposits that accumulate in tissues.
Onpattro is specifically indicated for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults.
Onpattro is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion. Dosing is based on body weight. For patients weighing less than 100 kg, the recommended dosage is 0.3 mg/kg every 3 weeks by intravenous infusion. For patients weighing 100 kg or more, the recommended dosage is 30 mg once every 3 weeks. Infuse over approximately 80 minutes. Premedicate with a corticosteroid, acetaminophen, and antihistamines to reduce the risk of infusion related reactions.
If a dose is missed, administer Onpattro as soon as possible. If Onpattro is administered within 3 days of the missed dose, continue dosing according to the patientâ€™s original schedule. If Onpattro is administered more than 3 days after the missed dose, continue dosing every 3 weeks thereafter.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Onpattro was based on the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global Phase III APOLLO study. The study enrolled 225 subjects who received intravenous Onpattro (0.3 mg per kg of body weight) or placebo once every 3 weeks for 18 months. The primary endpoint of the APOLLO study was the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7), which assesses motor strength, reflexes, sensation, nerve conduction and postural blood pressure. Patients treated with Onpattro had a mean 6.0-point decrease (improvement) in mNIS+7 score from baseline compared to a mean 28.0-point increase (worsening) for patients in the placebo group, resulting in a mean 34.0-point difference relative to placebo, after 18 months of treatment. Nearly all Onpattro-treated patients experienced a treatment benefit relative to placebo, and 56% of Onpattro-treated patients at 18 months of treatment experienced reversal of neuropathy impairment (as assessed by mNIS+7 score) relative to their own baseline, compared to four percent of patients who received placebo.

Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,Bexxar,"General Information
The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen (Tositumomab and Iodine I 131 Tositumomab) is an anti-neoplastic radioimmunotherapeutic monoclonal antibody-based treatment. It is composed of the monoclonal antibody, Tositumomab, and the radiolabeled monoclonal antibody, Iodine I 131 Tositumomab.
Treatment with BEXXAR (Tositumomab and Iodine I 131Tositumomab) is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive, follicular, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with and without transformation, whose disease is refractory to Rituximab and has relapsed following chemotherapy. BEXXAR is not indicated for the initial treatment of patients with CD20 positive non- Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma.
BEXXAR consists of four lengthy components administered in two discrete steps: the dosimetric step, followed 7-14 days later by a therapeutic step.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of BEXXAR was based on a multi-center, single-arm study in subjects with low grade or transformed low- grade or follicular large-cell lymphoma whose disease had not responded to or had progressed after Rituximab therapy. The study enrolled 40 subjects aged 35-78. Subjects were required to have received prior treatment with at least four doses of Rituximab without an objective response, or to have progressed following treatment. Overall, 35 of the 40 patients met the definition of â€œRituximab refractoryâ€�, defined as no response or a response of less than 6 months duration. Clinical benefit was based on evidence of durable responses without any evidence of an effect on survival.
Results demonstrated a durable objective responses in four single arm studies enrolling 190 subjects evaluable for efficacy with Rituximab-naÃ¯ve, follicular non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma with or without transformation, who had relapsed following or were refractory to chemotherapy. In these studies, the overall response rates ranged from 47% to 64% and the median duration of response ranged from 12 to 18 months.
The effect of BEXXAR on circulating CD20 positive cells was assessed in two clinical studies, one conducted in chemotherapy naÃ¯ve patients and one in heavily pretreated patients. Results showed that administration with BEXXAR results in sustained depletion of circulating CD20 positive cells. At seven weeks, the median number of circulating CD20 positive cells was zero (range: 0 - 490 cells/ mm3). Lymphocyte recovery began at approximately 12 weeks following treatment.

Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,Revlimid (lenalidomide),"General Information
Revlimid (lenalidomide) is an orally available thalidomide analog, exerting both anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory properties.
Revlimid is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
Revlimid is supplied as an opaque capsule for oral administration. Recommended dosing is 10 mg daily with water. Dosing may be reduced (to 5 mg once daily or once every other day) or temporarily suspended if incidence of thrombocytopenia or neutropenia is observed (see ","Side Effects, below).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Approval of Revlimid was based on results of an open-label, single arm, multi-center study that enrolled 148 patients with red-blood-cell-transfusion dependent anemia due to low-or intermediate-1- risk MDS associated with a 5 q (q31-33) cytogenetic abnormality in isolation or with additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Subjects received 10 mg Revlimid once daily either continuously or for 21 of every 28 days. Sequential dose reductions, to 5 mg daily and 5 mg every other day, were permitted to mitigate toxicities. The drug was shown to be efficacious in reducing the need for red-blood cell transfusions: 67% (n=99/148) of patients experienced a period of at least 8 weeks during which no transfusion was needed, and the median duration of transfusion independence was maintained for a median 44 weeks. 90% of responders experienced onset of transfusion independence within 3 months. Dose interruption or reduction due to toxicity was necessary in 79.7% of patients (n=118/148).
Ongoing Study Commitments
The embryo-fetal toxicity assessment of Revlimid has not been adequately addressed. Celgene has agreed to provide adequate information for this assessment in appropriate models designed to fully assess the possible toxicity of Revlimid. Celgene plans to conduct these studies in two different species that are appropriate to assess the full range of thalidomide embryo-fetal effects. As discussed, the rat is not an acceptable model. If the study with lenalidomide in the first species shows clear evidence of teratogenesis, than a confirmatory study will not be necessary. Although not generally considered definitive test systems for pharmaceutical products, additional studies of an exploratory nature on the embryo-fetal effects of lenalidomide may be useful.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Revlimid or myelodysplastic syndromes, please visit the Revlimid web page.","Mechanism of Action
The exact mechanism of Revlimid's activity has not been fully detailed. In-vitro and in-vivo studies indicated that the drug both inhibited the secretion of pro inflammatory cytokines and promoted the secretion of anti inflammatory cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The drug also inhibited expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) but not COX-1 in vitro. Additional antiproliferative activity was noted in some, but not all, human cell lines. The drug effectively inhibited growth of Namalwa cells, a human B cell lymphoma cell line with a deletion of one chromosome 5, but was much less effective in inhibiting the KG-1 human myeloblastic cell line (which also has a deletion of one chromosome 5), and other cell lines without chromosome 5 deletions.

Approximately 80% of fatal infusion reactions occurred in association with the first infusion. Monitor patients closely. Discontinue Rituxan infusion for severe reactions and provide medical treatment for Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions. Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions Severe, including fatal, mucocutaneous reactions can occur in patients receiving Rituxan. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation: HBV reactivation can occur in patients treated with Rituxan, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Screen all patients for HBV infection before treatment initiation, and monitor patients during and after treatment with Rituxan. Discontinue Rituxan and concomitant medications in the event of HBV reactivation. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal PML, can occur in patients receiving Rituxan.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Rituxan (rituximab) is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen expressed on the surface of pre-B and mature B-lymphocytes. Upon binding to CD20, rituximab mediates B-cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production.

Venclexta (venetoclax) is a is a BCL-2 inhibitor. Gazyva (obinutuzumab) is an engineered monoclonal antibody designed to attach to CD20, a protein found only on certain types of B-cells.
Venclexta (venetoclax) plus Gazyva (obinutuzumab) is specifically indicated for treatment of people with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).
Venclexta in combination with obinutuzumab is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is as follows: Start obinutuzumab administration at 100 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1, followed by 900 mg on Cycle 1 Day 2. Administer 1000 mg on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of each subsequent 28 day cycle, for a total of 6 cycles. Refer to the obinutuzumab prescribing information for recommended obinutuzumab dosing information. On Cycle 1 Day 22, start Venclexta according to the 5-week ramp-up schedule on the drug label. After completing the ramp-up schedule on Cycle 2 Day 28, patients should continue Venclexta 400 mg once daily from Cycle 3 Day 1 until the last day of Cycle 12.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of the Gazyva Venclexta combination was based on results of the randomized Phase III CLL14 study. The trial enrolled 432 patients with previously untreated CLL who were randomly assigned to receive either a 12-month duration of Venclexta alongside six-month duration of Gazyva (Arm A) or six-month duration of Gazyva plus chlorambucil followed by an additional six-month duration of chlorambucil (Arm B). Arm A started with an initial cycle of Gazyva followed by a five-week Venclexta dose ramp-up to help reduce tumor burden. The primary endpoint of the study was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Results showed the combination of Venclexta plus Gazyva produced a durable and significant reduction in the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by Independent Review Committee) by 67 percent compared to Gazyva plus chlorambucil, a current standard of care. Venclexta plus Gazyva showed deep and clinically meaningful responses characterized by a higher rate of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity in the bone marrow compared to Gazyva plus chlorambucil (MRD-negativity of 57 percent vs. 17 percent) and peripheral blood (MRD-negativity of 76 percent vs. 35 percent).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Venclexta plus Gazyva may include, but are not limited to, the following:
low white blood cell count
diarrhea

Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan),"General Information
In February 2002, Zevalin was the first radioimmunotherapy to receive FDA approval. Zevalin is indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory low grade, follicular, or transformed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). This indication includes patients with Rituxan (rituximab)-refractory follicular NHL. Zevalin has been approved as part of a therapeutic regimen involving Rituxan.
Zevalin consists of a monoclonal antibody linked to the radioactive isotope yttrium-90. After infusion into a patient, the monoclonal antibody targets the CD20 antigen, which is found on the surface of mature B cells and B-cell tumors. In this manner, cytotoxic radiation is delivered directly to malignant cells.
Clinical Results
Zevalin received both a full approval and an accelerated approval based on results from two major US efficacy studies.
The study that supported the full approval of Zevalin included 54 subjects. The subjects were diagnosed with relapsed follicular lymphoma, and they no longer adequately responded to Rituxan treatment. An overall response rate of 74% was achieved with Zevalin treatment, with 15% of subjects experiencing a complete response.
Accelerated approval of Zevalin was supported by a randomized, controlled phase III trial. The trial included 143 subjects with relapsed or refractory, low grade or follicular NHL or transformed B-cell NHL. An overall response rate of 80% was obtained in subjects receiving the Zevalin therapeutic regimen (73 subjects), compared to 56% for the subjects receiving Rituxan alone (70 subjects). Thirty percent of Zevalin-treated subjects experienced a complete response, compared to a 16% complete response rate for Rituxan-treated subjects.
","Side Effects
In clinical trials, serious adverse reactions caused by the Zevalin therapeutic regimen included infections, allergic reactions, and hemorrhage while thrombocytopenic. In addition, the development of myeloid malignancies and dysplasias have been reported.
Adverse events that occurred in greater than 5% of subjects include (but are not limited to) the following:
Nausea
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Anorexia
Thrombocytopenia (decreased number of blood platelets)
Neutropenia (decreased number of white blood cells)
Anemia
Arthralgia (joint pain)
Dizziness
Dyspnea (difficult or labored breathing)
Increased cough
",,"Mechanism of Action
The complementarity-determining regions of Ibritumomab bind to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes. Ibritumomab, like Rituximab, induces apoptosis in CD20+ B-cell lines in vitro. The chelate tiuxetan, which tightly binds In-111 or Y-90, is covalently linked to the amino groups of exposed lysines and arginines contained within the antibody. The beta emission from Y-90 induces cellular damage by the formation of free radicals in the target and neighboring cells. (from Zevalin Prescribing Information)

Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,Zydelig (idelalisib),"General Information
Zydelig (idelalisib) is a small molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) delta, an intracellular signaling component. PI3K-delta is expressed primarily in blood-cell lineages, including cells that cause or mediate hematologic malignancies.
Zydelig is specifically indicated for the following:
Relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia in combination with rituximab, in patients for whom rituximab alone would be considered appropriate therapy due to other co-morbidities.
Relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.
Relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma in patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies
Zydelig is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended maximum starting dose of Zydelig is 150 mg administered orally twice daily. Zydelig can be taken with or without food. Tablets should be swallowed whole. Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Zydelig was granted regular approval for use in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Accelerated approval was granted for relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (FL) and relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) based on overall response rate. Improvement in patient survival or disease related symptoms has not been established. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
Relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia
Zydelig was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 1) in 220 subjects with relapsed CLL who required treatment and were unable to tolerate standard chemoimmunotherapy. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive 8 doses of rituximab (first dose at 375 mg/m2, subsequent doses at 500 mg/m2 every 2 weeks for 4 infusions and every 4 weeks for an additional 4 infusions) in combination with either an oral placebo twice daily or with Zydelig 150 mg taken twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). The subjects who received Zydelig in combination with rituximab went approximately 11 months without disease pregression, compared to approximately 6 months for subjects given rituximab and a placebo (p < 0.0001).
Relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
A single-arm, multicenter clinical trial enrolled 72 subjects with follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had relapsed within 6 months following rituximab and an alkylating agent and had received at least 2 prior treatments. Subjects received 150 mg of Zydelig orally twice daily until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was Independent Review Committee-assessed overall response rate. Zydelig achieved an overall response rate of 54%; 8% were complete responses and 46% were partial responses. The median duration of response was not reached.
Relapsed Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
A single-arm, multicenter clinical trial enrolled 26 subjects with small lymphocytic lymphoma who had relapsed within 6 months following rituximab and an alkylating agent and had received at least 2 prior treatments. Subjects received 150 mg of Zydelig orally twice daily until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was Independent Review Committee-assessed overall response rate. Zydelig achieved an overall response rate of 58%; all responses were partial responses. The median duration of response was 11.9 months.
","Side Effects

Zydelig (idelalisib) is a small molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) delta, an intracellular signaling component. PI3K-delta is expressed primarily in blood-cell lineages, including cells that cause or mediate hematologic malignancies. Idelalisib induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in cell lines derived from malignant B-cells and in primary tumor cells. Idelalisib inhibits several cell signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and the CXCR4 and CRCR5 signaling, which are involved in trafficking and homing of B-cells to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. Treatment of lymphoma cells with idelalisib resulted in inhibition of chemotaxis and adhesion, and reduced cell viability.

Abraxane (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) is an intravenous nanoparticle, albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel, a cancer chemotherapy, that is protein-stable and Cremophor-free. It was designed to deliver a greater amount of chemotherapy to cancer cells with fewer side effects.
Abraxane is specifically indicated for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in combination with carboplatin, in patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy.
Abraxane is supplied as a solution for intravenous injection. The recommended dose is 100 mg/m2 administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. The recommended dose of carboplatin is AUC = 6 mg min/mL on Day 1 only of each 21-day cycle, beginning immediately after the completion of Abraxane administration.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Abraxane for non-small cell lung cancer was based on a multicenter, randomized, open-label conducted in 1052 chemonaive patients with Stage IIIb/IV non-small cell lung cancer. The trial was designed to compare Abraxane in combination with carboplatin to paclitaxel injection in combination with carboplatin as first-line treatment. Abraxane was administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. Paclitaxel injection was administered as an intravenous infusion over 3 hours at a dose of 200 mg/m2, following premedication. In both treatment arms carboplatin at a dose of AUC = 6 mg min/mL was administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle after completion of Abraxane/paclitaxel infusion. Treatment was administered until disease progression or development of an unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy outcome was overall response rate. Subjects in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm had a statistically significantly higher overall response rate compared to those in the paclitaxel injection/carboplatin arm (33% versus 25%). There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two study arms.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Abraxane when used in combination with carboplatin for non-small cell lung cancer may include, but are not limited to, the following:
anemia
neutropenia
thrombocytopenia

Initial Treatment in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy, for patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations
The efficacy of Alimta in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy was investigated in KEYNOTE-189, a randomized, double-blind, phase III study in patients (n=616) with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who received no prior treatment for metastatic disease. The patients were randomized, 2:1, to receive pemetrexed and a platinum-based chemotherapy plus either pembrolizumab (test arm) or placebo (control arm). Patients were stratified based on PD-L1 tumor proportion score (<1 percent or â‰¥ 1 percent), among other factors. After a median follow-up of 10.5 months, median OS was not reached in the test arm, versus 11.3 months in the control arm. Compared with patients in the control arm, those in the test arm were 51 percent less likely to die, and those in the high PD-L1 score group were 58 percent less likely to die. Median PFS was 8.8 months for the pembrolizumab arm, versus 4.9 months for the control arm.
Initial Treatment in combination with cisplatin for patients with locally advanced or metastatic, non-squamous NSCLC
Study JMDB was a multi-center, randomized (1:1), open-label study conducted in 1,725 chemotherapy-naive patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC. Patients were randomized to receive Alimta with cisplatin or gemcitabine with cisplatin. Randomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS 0 versus 1), gender, disease stage, basis for pathological diagnosis (histopathological/cytopathological), history of brain metastases, and investigative center. Alimta was administered intravenously over 10 minutes at a dose of 500mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Cisplatin was administered intravenously at a dose of 75mg/m2 approximately 30 minutes after Alimta administration on Day 1 of each cycle, gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 1250mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 8, and cisplatin was administered intravenously at a dose of 75mg/m2 approximately 30minutes after administration of gemcitabine, on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle. Treatment was administered up to a total of 6 cycles; patients in both arms received folic acid, vitaminB12, and dexamethasone. The primary efficacy outcome measure was overall survival. The median overall survival was 10.3 months for both arms.
As a single agent for the treatment of patients with recurrent, metastatic non-squamous, NSCLC after prior chemotherapy
Study JMEI was a multi-center, randomized (1:1), open-label study conducted in patients (n=571) with Stage III or IV NSCLC that had recurred or progressed following one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease. Patients were randomized to receive Alimta 500mg/m2 intravenously or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1-hour intravenous infusion once every 21 days. Patients randomized to Alimta also received folic acid and vitaminB12. The primary endpoint was reached, with data showing that overall survival with Alimta was non-inferior to docetaxel.
Maintenance Treatment Following First-line Non-ALIMTA Containing Platinum-Based Chemotherapy
The efficacy of Alimta as maintenance therapy following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy was evaluated in Study JMEN, a multicenter, randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 663 patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC who did not progress after four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive Alimta 500 mg/m2 intravenously every 21 days or placebo until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Patients in both study arms received folic acid, vitamin B12, and dexamethasone. The major efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival based on assessment by independent review and overall survival. The median overall survival was 13.4 months in the Alimta arm and 10.6 months in the placebo arm. The median progression free survival was four months for the Alimta arm versus 2.0 months for the placebo arm.
Maintenance Treatment Following First-line ALIMTA Plus Platinum Chemotherapy
The efficacy of Alimta as maintenance therapy following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy was also evaluated in PARAMOUNT, a multi-center, randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in patients with Stage IIIb/IV non-squamous NSCLC who had completed four cycles of Alimta in combination with cisplatin and achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD). Patients were required to have an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Patients were randomized to receive Alimta 500mg/m2 intravenously every 21 days or placebo until disease progression. Randomization was stratified by response to Alimta in combination with cisplatin induction therapy (CR or PR versus SD), disease stage (IIIb versus IV), and ECOG PS(0 versus 1). Patients in both arms received folic acid, vitamin B12, and dexamethasone. The main efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS) and an additional efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS).

",,"Mechanism of Action
Alimta (pemetrexed) is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor that disrupts folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. Invitro studies show that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT),which are folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is taken into cells by membrane carriers such as the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT.

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Avastin as first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent nonâ€“squamous NSCLC was based on a single, large, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter study. A total of 878 chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent nonâ€“squamous NSCLC were randomized (1:1) to receive six 21-day cycles of paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 6) with or without Avastin 15 mg/kg. After completing or discontinuing chemotherapy, patients randomized to receive Avastin continued to receive Avastin alone until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity. OS was statistically significantly longer for patients receiving Avastin with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Median OS was 12.3 months versus 10.3 months. Based on investigator assessment which was not independently verified, patients were reported to have longer PFS with Avastin with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared to chemotherapy alone.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,Hycamtin (topotecan hydrochloride),"General Information
Hycamtin (topotecan) is a semi-synthetic derivative of camptothecin and is an anti-tumor drug with topoisomerase I-inhibitory activity. Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single strand breaks.
Hycamtin is specifically indicated for the treatment of relapsed small cell lung cancer in patients with a prior complete or partial response and who are at least 45 days from the end of first-line chemotherapy.
Hycamtin is supplied as a 0.25 mg and 1 mg capsule designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 2.3 mg/m2/day once daily for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 21 days. The calculated oral daily dose should be rounded to the nearest 0.25 mg, and the minimum number of 1 mg and 0.25 mg capsules should be prescribed. The same number of capsules should be prescribed for each of the 5 dosing days.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Hycamtin was based on the results of a clinical trial. This randomized, comparative, open label study enrolled 115 subjects who were prior responders (complete or partial) to firstline chemotherapy, were not considered candidates for standard intravenous chemotherapy, and had relapsed at least 45 days from the end of first-line chemotherapy. The subjects received Hycamtin (2.3 mg/m2/day administered for 5 consecutive days repeated every 21 days) and Best Supportive Care (BSC) or BSC alone. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Median survival in the Hycamtin arm was 25.9 weeks (95% CI, 18.3 to 31.6) versus 13.9 weeks (95% CI, 11.1 to 18.6) in the BSC alone arm (log-rank P = .0104).
","Side Effects
The side effects associated with the use of Hycamtin may include, but are not limited to, the following:

",,"Mechanism of Action
Hycamtin (topotecan) is a semi-synthetic derivative of camptothecin and is an anti-tumor drug with topoisomerase I-inhibitory activity. Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single strand breaks. The cytotoxicity of topotecan is thought to be due to double strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis, when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topotecan, topoisomerase I, and DNA. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks.

Imfinzi is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who:
ï‚·1) have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy
ï‚·2) have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy
Imfinzi is also specifically approved for patients with Stage III non-small cell lung cancer whose tumor cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) and whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy given at the same time as radiation therapy.
Imfinzi is supplied as an infusion for intravenous administration. The recommended dose is 10 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Please see drug label for treatment modifications.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
This indication was approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. The accelerated FDA approval of Imfinzi was based on the urothelial cancer cohort of a multicenter, multicohort, open-label clinical trial. This cohort consisted of 182 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who had progressed while on or after a platinum-based therapy, including those who progressed within 12 months of receiving therapy in a neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting. These patients had initiated durvalumab therapy at least 13 weeks prior to the data cut-off date. All patients received Imfinzi 10 mg/kg via intravenous infusion every 2 weeks for up to 12 months or until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tumor assessments were performed at Weeks 6, 12 and 16, then every 8 weeks for the first year and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), and duration of response (DoR). The ORR was 17% and the median DoR was not reached. Among the total 31 responding patients, 1s (45%) had ongoing responses of 6 months or longer and five (16%) had ongoing responses of 12 months or longer.
The FDA approval of Imfinzi for non-small cell lung cancer was based on the PACIFIC study in 713 patients with unresectable Stage 3 NSCLC who completed at least 2 cycles of concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation before starting study drug. Imfinzi was tested against placebo. The endpoints were progression free survival and overall survival. The median time for PFS was 16.8 months for 476 patients receiving Imfinzi compared with 5.6 months for 237 patients receiving placebo. Subjects in the Imfinzi arm had a 48% lower chance of lung cancer growing or spreading than those receiving placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Imfinzi may include, but are not limited to, the following:

peripheral edema
urinary tract infection
Adverse effects associated with the use of Imfinzi for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) include :
cough
fatigue
pneumonitis
upper respiratory tract infections
shortness of breath
rash
",,"Mechanism of Action
Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody. Expression of PD-L1 can be induced by inflammatory signals (e.g., IFN-gamma) and can be expressed on both tumor cells and tumor-associated immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and activation through interaction with PD-1 and CD80. By binding to its receptors, PD-L1 reduces cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation, and cytokine production. Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1Îº) monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80. Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions releases the inhibition of immune responses, without inducing antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,Iressa (gefitinib),"General Information
Iressa is an anticancer drug that inhibits an enzyme (tyrosine kinase) present in lung cancer cells, as well as other cancers and normal tissues, that appears to be important to the growth of cancer cells. It is taken alone, not with other chemotherapy.
The recommended daily dose of Iressa is one 250 mg tablet with or without food. Higher doses do not give a better response and causes increased toxicity.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Iressa was based on a phase III trial. The multicenter clinical trial in the U.S. evaluated the tumor response rate of Iressa 250 and 500 mg/day in 216 subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose disease had progressed after at least two prior chemotherapy regimens including a platinum drug and docetaxel. Iressa was taken once daily at approximately the same time each day. Subjects received Iressa, 102 (47%) and 114 (53%) receiving 250 mg and 500 mg daily doses, respectively. In addition, 41% of the subjects had received two prior treatment regimens, 33% three prior treatment regimens, and 25% four or more prior treatment regimens.
Results showed that the overall response rate for the 250 and 500 mg doses combined was 10.6% (95% CI: 6%, 16.8%). Response rates appeared to be highly variable in subgroups of the treated population: 5.1% (4/79) in males, 17.5% (11/63) in females, 4.6% (5/108) in previous or current smokers, 29.4% (10/34) in nonsmokers, 12.4% (12/97) with adenocarcinoma histology, and 6.7% (3/45) with other NSCLC histologies. Similar differences in response were seen in a multinational study in subjects who had received 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, at least l of which was platinum-based. In responders, the median time from diagnosis to study randomization was 16.7 months (range 8 to 34 months).

",,"Mechanism of Action
Gefitinib is an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It works by binding to the intracellular enzyme (tyrosine kinase) of the EGFR to directly block signals turned on by triggers outside or inside the cell.
The activity of epidermal growth factor and its receptor, the EGFR, have been identified as key drivers in the process of cell growth and replication. Heightened activity at the EGF receptor, whether caused by an increase in the concentration of ligand around the cell, an increase in receptor numbers or a decrease in receptor turnover or receptor mutation, can lead to an increase in the drive for the cell to replicate. There is now a body of evidence to show that the EGFR-mediated drive is increased in a wide variety of solid tumours, including non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer and tumours of the head and neck.
Gefitinib is an anilinoquinazoline with the chemical name 4-Quinazolinamine. The mechanism of the clinical antitumor action of gefitinib is not fully characterized. Gefitinib inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of numerous tyrosine kinases associated with transmembrane cell surface receptors, including the tyrosine kinases associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TK). EGFR is expressed on the cell surface of many normal cells and cancer cells. No clinical studies have been performed that demonstrate a correlation between EGFR receptor expression and response to gefitinib.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,Keytruda (pembrolizumab),"General Information
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) targets the cellular pathway known as PD-1/PD-L1, proteins found on the bodyâ€™s immune cells and some cancer cells. By blocking this pathway, Keytruda may help the bodyâ€™s immune system fight the cancer cells.
Keytruda is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an FDA-approved test with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving Keytruda.
Keyruda is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion. The recommended dose of Keytruda is 2 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Keytruda for non-small cell lung cancer was based on a subgroup of 61 patients enrolled within a larger multicenter, open-label, multi-part study. The subgroup consisted of patients with advanced NSCLC that progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy or, if appropriate, targeted therapy for certain genetic mutations (ALK or EGFR). This subgroup also had PD-L1 positive tumors based on the results of the 22C3 pharmDx diagnostic test. Study subjects received 10 mg/kg of Keytruda every two or three weeks. The major outcome measure was overall response rate (percentage of subjects who experienced complete and partial shrinkage of their tumors). Tumors shrank in 41 percent of subjects treated with Keytruda and the effect lasted between 2.1 and 9.1 months.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Keytruda may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Keytruda also has the potential to cause severe side effects that result from the immune system effect of Keytruda (known as â€œimmune-mediated side effectsâ€�).
",,"Mechanism of Action
Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response.

The FDA approved of Opdivo for metastatic squamous nonsmall cell lung cancer was based on a randomized, open-label study enrolling 272 patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC who had experienced disease progression during or after one prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy regimen. Patients received Opdivo administered intravenously at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or docetaxel administered intravenously at 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. This study included patients regardless of their PD-L1 status. The first tumor assessments were conducted 9 weeks after randomization and continued every 6 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients randomized to Opdivo as compared with docetaxel at the prespecified interim analysis when 199 events were observed (86% of the planned number of events for final analysis). The median survival was 9.2 months versus 6.0 months for the Opdivo versus docetaxel arms, respectively.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Opdivo for advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer may include, but are not limited to, the following:
fatigue
dyspnea
musculoskeletal pain
decreased appetite
cough
nausea
constipation
",,"Mechanism of Action
Opdivo (nivolumab) is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,Portrazza (necitumumab),"General Information
Portrazza (necitumumab) is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist.
Portrazza is specifically indicated for use in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin, for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
Portrazza is supplied as a solution for intravenous administration. The recommended dose is 800 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle prior to gemcitabine and cisplatin infusion. Continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Please see drug label for specific dose modifications.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Portrazza was based on SQUIRE ,an open-label, randomized, multi-center Phase III trial that compared first-line treatment with Portrazza in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin to treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in 1,093 patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC. Patients on both arms of the study were allowed to receive a maximum of six cycles of chemotherapy. Patients on the Portrazza arm demonstrating at least stable disease continued to receive additional cycles of Portrazza until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Results showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival over gemcitabine and cisplatin alone, specifically in the first-line setting. Portrazza combination therapy showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, the main outcome measure (p=0.01), with a median overall survival of 11.5 months for the Portrazza arm, as compared to 9.9 months for those treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone. This translated to a 16 percent reduction in risk of death. The percentage of deaths at the time of analysis was 77% on the Portrazza arm and 81% on the control arm. The significant survival improvement observed in SQUIRE was supported by a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (p=0.02), with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.7 months on the Portrazza arm, as compared to 5.5 months for those treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone. The percentage of events at the time of analysis was 79% on the Portrazza arm and 76% on the control arm. Overall response rate (ORR) was also assessed and there was no difference between arms, with an ORR of 31% for the Portrazza plus gemcitabine and cisplatin arm and an ORR of 29% for the gemcitabine and cisplatin arm (p=0.40).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Portrazza may include, but are not limited to, the following:
rash
hypomagnesemia
Portrazza comes with a boxed warning regarding the risk of cardiopulmonary arrest and hypomagnesemia.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Portrazza (necitumumab) is a recombinant human lgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and blocks the binding of EGFR to its ligands. Expression and activation of EGFR has been correlated with malignant progression, induction of angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis. Binding of necitumumab induces EGFR internalization and degradation in vitro. In vitro, binding of necitumumab also led to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in EGFR-expressing cells.

â€¢ the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with solid tumors that:
Â· have a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation,
Â· are metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and
Â· have either progressed following treatment or have no satisfactory alternative therapy.
This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.
Rozlytrek is supplied as capsule for oral administration. Patients should be selected for treatment based on the presence of ROS1 rearrangement(s) or NTRK gene fusion.
Recommended Dosage for ROS1-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: 600 mg orally once daily.
Recommended Dosage for NTRK Gene Fusion-Positive Solid Tumors: * Adults: 600 mg orally once daily. * Pediatric Patients 12 Years and Older: Recommended dosage is based on body surface area (BSA) as shown: â€¢ BSA greater than 1.50 m2: 600 mg once daily â€¢ BSA 1.11 to 1.50 m2: 500 mg once daily â€¢ BSA 0.91 to 1.10 m2: 400 mg once daily
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Rozlytrek was based on the integrated analysis of the Phase II STARTRK-2, Phase I STARTRK-1 and Phase I ALKA-372-001 trials, and data from the Phase I/II STARTRK-NG study. In the integrated analysis, Rozlytrek was studied in several solid tumor types, including breast, cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal, gynecological, neuroendocrine, non-small cell lung, salivary gland, pancreatic, sarcoma and thyroid cancers. In ROS1-positive, metastatic NSCLC, Rozlytrek shrank tumors in 78% of people with the disease (overall response rate [ORR]; N=51) and the duration of response (DoR) ranged from 1.8 to 36.8+ months (N=40 out of 51). Rozlytrek also shrank tumors in more than half of people with NTRK gene fusion-positive, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors (ORR=57%; N=54), and objective responses were observed across 10 tumor types (DoR ranged from 2.8 to 26.0+ months; N=31 out of 54). Objective responses to Rozlytrek were seen in people with central nervous system (CNS) metastases at baseline.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Rozlytrek may include, but are not limited to, the following:
fatigue
constipation
altered sense of taste (dysgeusia)

shortness of breath (dyspnea)
muscle pain (myalgia)
cognitive impairment
increased weight
cough
vomiting
fever (pyrexia)
joint pain (arthralgia)
vision disorders
",,"Mechanism of Action
Rozlytrek (entrectinib) is an inhibitor of the tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinases (TRK) TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC (encoded by the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase [NTRK] genes NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3, respectively), proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS1 (ROS1), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) with IC50 values of 0.1 to 2 nM. Entrectinib also inhibits JAK2 and TNK2 with IC50 values > 5 nM. The major active metabolite of entrectinib, M5, showed similar in vitro activity against TRK, ROS1, and ALK. Fusion proteins that include TRK, ROS1, or ALK kinase domains can drive tumorigenic potential through hyperactivation of downstream signaling pathways leading to unconstrained cell proliferation. Entrectinib demonstrated in vitro and in vivo inhibition of cancer cell lines derived from multiple tumor types harboring NTRK, ROS1, and ALK fusion genes.

"
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Tarceva (erlotinib, OSI 774)","General Information
Tarceva (erlotinib) is a Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Type 1/Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER1/EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. While the complete mechanism of action is not entirely understood, the drug appears to impede cell-cell singlaling pathways which have been implicated in rapid cell division and survival. Overactivation of these pathways are thought to be central to tumor growth and metastasis.
It is specifically indicated as monotherapy to treat non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have failed to respond or has ceased responding to at least one round of chemotherapy. It is not indicated as a first-line therapy: results from two, multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase 3 trials conducted in first-line patients showed no clinical benefit with the concurrent administration of Tarceva with platinum-based chemotherapy regimens..
Tarceva is administered as an oral tablet, with a recommended dosage of 150 mg once daily at least one hour before or two hours after eating. Patients experiencing significant adverse reactions should reduce dosage as appropriate in 50 mg decrements.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Tarceva was a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies enrolling a combined total of 731 subjects with confirmed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one chemotherapy regimen. The trial randomized subjects at a 2:1 ratio to receive Tarceva (n=488) or placebo (n=243) orally once daily until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the intent to treat population, Tarceva was found to significantly improve 1-year survival time, progression free tumor response and response duration, and medain overall response duration. In subsets of patients with EGFR positive tumors and patients who never smoked, the drug appeared to carry improved efficacy.
Results from two, multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, trials in over 1000 patients investigating the drug as an first-line adjuvant to standard platinum based chemotherapy regimens (carboplatin and paclitaxel or gemcitabine and cisplatin) indicated that patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC showed no clinical benefit in terms of tumor response or survival benefit with the concurrent administration of TARCEVA, versus chemotherapy alone.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Tarceva may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Rash
Diarrhea
Anorexia
Stomatitis
Pruritus
Infection
In addition to these events, infrequent serious Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) has been observed, including fatalities. ILD incidence in the trial which formed the basis of FDA approval was the same for both placebo and Tarceva groups (0.8% of patients). Most cases were associated with confounding or contributing factors. Tarceva use should be suspended pending evaluation on the appearance of new pulomary symptoms, and discontinued upon diagnosis of ILD.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Tarceva (erlotinib) is a Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Type 1/Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER1/EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. While the complete mechanism of action is not entirely understood, the HER1 and EGFR receptors are directly involved in inter-cellular signalling in systems governing cell division and prolifferation. By inhibiting the function of these receptors, which are highly active and often over-expressed in rapidly dividng tumor cells, Tarceva is thought to limit tumor cells' ability to divide and metastasize, and may help to initiate pathways of apoptotic cell death.

Have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy
Have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy
Tecentriq is specifically indicated for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving Tecentriq.
Tecentriq is specifically indicated in combination with chemotherapy (Abraxane [paclitaxel protein-bound; nab-paclitaxel] and carboplatin) for the initial (first-line) treatment of adults with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations
Tecentriq is supplied as a solution for intravenous injection. The recommended dose is 1200 mg as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 3 weeks.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
urothelial carcinoma
The FDA approval of Tecentriq was based on a single-arm clinical trial involving 310 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This trial measured the percentage of patients who experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors (objective response rate). The study also looked at the difference in effect based on â€œpositiveâ€� versus â€œnegativeâ€� expression of the PD-L1 protein on patientsâ€™ tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In all patients, 14.8 percent of experienced at least a partial shrinkage of their tumors, an effect that lasted from more than 2.1 to more than 13.8 months at the time of the response analysis. In patients who were classified as â€œpositiveâ€� for PD-L1 expression, 26 percent experienced a tumor response, compared to 9.5 percent of patients who were classified as â€œnegativeâ€� for PD-L1 expression.
non-small cell lung cancer
The FDA approval of Tecentriq for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer was based on results from the randomized Phase III OAK and Phase II POPLAR studies. OAK was a global, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study which enrolled 1,225 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive either docetaxel (75 mg/m2 intravenous infusion) or Tecentriq (1200 mg intravenous infusion) every three weeks. Results from OAK showed that Tecentriq helped subjects in the overall study population live a median of 13.8 months, 4.2 months longer than those treated with docetaxel chemotherapy (median overall survival [OS]: 13.8 vs. 9.6 months). The study enrolled subjects regardless of their PD-L1 status and included both squamous and non-squamous disease types. POPLAR enrolled 287 subjects. The study showed Tecentriq doubled the likelihood of survival OS in subjects whose cancer expressed the highest levels of PD-L1 compared with docetaxel chemotherapy. An improvement in survival was also observed in subjects who had medium and high or any level of PD-L1 expression.
adults with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations
The FDA approval of Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in combination with chemotherapy (Abraxane [paclitaxel protein-bound; nab-paclitaxel] and carboplatin) for the initial (first-line) treatment of adults with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations was based on the Phase III IMpower130 study, which showed Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy helped people live significantly longer compared to chemotherapy alone (median overall survival [OS]=18.6 versus 13.9 months) in the intention-to-treat wild-type (ITT-WT) population. The Tecentriq-based combination also significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (progression-free survival [PFS]) compared with chemotherapy alone (median PFS=7.2 versus 6.5 months) in the ITT-WT population.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Tecentriq in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Tencentriq also has the potential to cause infection and serious side effects that result from the immune system effect of Tencentriq (known as â€œimmune-mediated side effectsâ€�).
",,"Mechanism of Action
Tecentriq (atezolizumab) is a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody. PD-L1 may be expressed on tumor cells and/or tumor-infiltrating immune cells and can contribute to the inhibition of the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors found on T cells and antigen presenting cells suppresses cytotoxic T-cell activity, T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks its interactions with both PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. This releases the PD-L1/PD-1 mediated inhibition of the immune response, including activation of the anti-tumor immune response without inducing antibodyÂ­ dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

Nutrition and Weight Loss,Bydureon (exenatide extended-release for injectable suspension),"General Information
Bydureon is an extended-release formulation of exenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist that enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cell, suppresses inappropriately elevated glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying.
Bydureon is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes mellitus in multiple clinical settings.
Bydureon is supplied as a powder suspension to be reconstituted into a solution. The recommended dose is 2 mg administered once every seven days (weekly). The dose can be administered at any time of day, with or without meals. Bydureon is administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm region.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Bydureon was based on a 24-week comparator-controlled study> This randomized, open-label trial was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of Bydureon to Byetta in 252 subjects with type II diabetes and inadequate glycemic control with diet and exercise alone or with oral antidiabetic therapy, including metformin, a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, or combination of two of those therapies. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive Bydureon 2 mg once every seven days (weekly) or Byetta (10 mcg twice-daily), in addition to existing oral antidiabetic agents. Subjects assigned to Byetta initiated treatment with 5 mcg twice-daily then increased the dose to 10 mcg twice-daily after 4 weeks. The mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 (or the last value at time of early discontinuation). The mean change from baseline was for Bydureon -1.6 and for -0.9 Byetta. The percentage achieving HbA1c <7% at Week 24 was 58% in the Bydureon arm and 30% in the Byetta arm. Reductions from mean baseline (97/94 kg) in body weight were observed in both Bydureon (-2.3 kg) and Byetta (-1.4 kg) treatment groups.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Bydureon may include, but are not limited to, the following:

",,"Mechanism of Action
Bydureon is an extended-release formulation of exenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist that enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cell, suppresses inappropriately elevated glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying. The amino acid sequence of exenatide partially overlaps that of human GLP-1. Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that has been shown to bind and activate the human GLP-1 receptor in vitro. This leads to an increase in both glucose-dependent synthesis of insulin and in vivo secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells, by mechanisms involving cyclic AMP and/or other intracellular signaling pathways. Exenatide promotes insulin release from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations.

SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.

Nutrition and Weight Loss,MERIDIA,"General Information
In October of 2010 the FDA requested that Abbott Laboratoriesâ€”the manufacturer of Meridiaâ€”voluntarily withdraw this drug product from the United States market due to cardiovascular risks. Abbott agreed to voluntarily stop marketing of Meridia in the United States.
MERIDIA (sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate) has been approved for the management of obesity, including weight loss and maintenance of weight loss, when used in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet.
","Side Effects
Most side effects associated with MERIDIA are mild and transient in nature, including dry mouth, headache, constipation, and insomnia.
",,"Mechanism of Action
MERIDIA works in a different manner than other prescription weight management medications. It is a neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor that merely enhances the body's normal function. MERIDIA is not a releasing agent. It does not get inside the cells to boost the release of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin. Instead, as a reuptake inhibitor, MERIDIA works outside the cells to stop neurotransmitters from being reabsorbed. MERIDIA works by affecting natural chemicals in the brain involved in regulating appetite--allowing them to act longer. The appetite control center in the brain is believed to regulate the amount of food eaten through feelings of hunger and fullness."

Nutrition and Weight Loss,Nesina (alogliptin),"General Information
Nesina (alogliptin) is a small-molecule, orally available dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) inhibitor. DPP-4 inhibitors slow the inactivation of incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide), both of which play a role in regulating blood glucose levels.
Nesina is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes mellitus.
Nesina is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is 25 mg once daily, with or without food.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Nesina was based on three double-blind studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety in 1,768 patients with inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise. All three studies had a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period followed by a 26-week randomized treatment period.
In a 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a total of 329 patients (mean baseline A1C = 8%) were randomized to receive Nesina 12.5 mg, 25 mg, or placebo once daily. Treatment with Nesina 25 mg resulted in statistically significant improvements from baseline in A1C and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo at Week 26: 44% in the Nesina arm achieved A1C <7% versus 23% in the placebo arm and in the Nesina arm there was a -16 change in FPG from baseline versus a 11 increase in the placebo arm. . A total of 8% of patients receiving Nesina 25 mg and 30% of those receiving placebo required glycemic rescue therapy.
In a 26-week, double-blind, active-controlled study, a total of 655 patients (mean baseline A1C = 8.8%) were randomized to receive Nesina 25 mg alone, pioglitazone 30 mg alone, Nesina 12.5 mg with pioglitazone 30 mg, or Nesina 25 mg with pioglitazone 30 mg once daily. Coadministration of Nesina 25 mg with pioglitazone 30 mg resulted in statistically significant improvements from baseline in A1C and FPG compared to Nesina 25 mg alone and to pioglitazone 30 mg alone.
In a 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a total of 784 patients inadequately controlled on diet and exercise alone (mean baseline A1C = 8.4%) were randomized to 1 of 7 treatment groups: placebo; metformin HCl 500 mg or metformin HCl 1000 mg twice daily, Nesina 12.5 mg twice daily, or Nesina 25 mg daily;Nesina 12.5 mg in combination with metformin HCl 500 mg or metformin HCl 1000 mg twice daily. Both coadministration treatment arms (Nesina 12.5 mg + metformin HCl 500 mg and Nesina 12.5 mg + metformin HCl 1000 mg) resulted in statistically significant improvements in A1C and FPG when compared with their respective individual alogliptin and metformin component regimens.

Nutrition and Weight Loss,Qsymia (phentermine + topiramate extended-release),"General Information
Qsymia is a combination of phentermine, a sympathomimetic amine anorectic, and topiramate extended-release, an antiepileptic drug.
Qsymia is specifically indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obese), or 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight related comorbidity such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia.
Qsymia is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. Qsymia should be administered once daily in the morning with or without food. Avoid dosing with Qsymia in the evening due to the possibility of insomnia. The recommended dose is as follows: Start treatment with Qsymia 3.75 mg/23 mg (phentermine/topiramate extended-release) daily for 14 days; after 14 days increase to the recommended dose of Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg once daily. Evaluate weight loss after 12 weeks of treatment with Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg. If at least 3% of baseline body weight has not been lost on Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg, discontinue Qsymia or escalate the dose. To escalate the dose: Increase to Qsymia 11.25 mg/69 mg daily for 14 days; followed by dosing Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg daily. Evaluate weight loss following dose escalation to Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg after an additional 12 weeks of treatment. If at least 5% of baseline body weight has not been lost on Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg, discontinue Qsymia as directed.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Qsymia was based on two randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies in obese patients (Study 1) and in obese and overweight patients with two or more significant co-morbidities (Study 2). Both studies had a four-week titration period, followed by 52 weeks of treatment. Two co-primary efficacy outcomes were measured after 1 year of treatment (Week 56): 1) the percent weight loss from baseline; and 2) treatment response defined as achieving at least 5% weight loss from baseline. During the studies, a well-balanced, reduced-calorie diet to result in an approximate 500 kcal/day decrease in caloric intake was recommended and subjects were offered nutritional and lifestyle modification counseling.
Study One
Obese subjects (BMI greater than or equal to 35 kg/m2) were randomized to receive 1 year of treatment with placebo (N=514), Qsymia 3.75 mg/23 mg (N=241), or Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg (N=512). At the beginning of the study the average weight and BMI was 116 kg and 42 kg/m2, respectively. In this study 40% of randomized subjects withdrew prior to week 56. After 1 year of treatment with Qsymia, all dose levels resulted in statistically significant weight loss compared to placebo. A statistically significant greater proportion of the subjects randomized to Qsymia than placebo achieved 5% and 10% weight loss: 17%, 45% and 67% and 7%, 19% and 47% in the placebo, Qsymia 3.75 mg/23 mg and Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg arms, respectively.
Study Two
Overweight and obese subjects were randomized to receive 1 year of treatment with placebo (N=994), Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg (N=498), or Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg (N=995). Eligible subjects had to have a BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2 and less than or equal to45 kg/m2 (no lower limit on BMI for patients with type 2 diabetes) and two or more of the following obesity-related co-morbid conditions: elevated blood pressure, triglycerides greater than 200-400 mg/dL, elevated fasting blood glucose or diabetes and waist circumference greater than or equal to 102 cm for men or greater than or equal to 88 cm for women. The average weight and BMI at the start of the study was 103 kg and 36.6 kg/m2, respectively. In this study 31% of randomized subjects withdrew prior to week 56. After 1 year of treatment with Qsymia, all dose levels resulted in statistically significant weight loss compared to placebo. A statistically significant greater proportion of the subjects randomized to Qsymia than placebo achieved 5% and 10% weight loss: 21%, 62% and 70% and 7%, 37% and 48% in the placebo, Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg and Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg treatment arms, respectively.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Qsymia may include, but are not limited to, the following:
paraesthesia
dizziness
dysgeusia
insomnia
constipation
dry mouth
",,"Mechanism of Action
Qsymia is a combination of phentermine, a sympathomimetic amine anorectic, and topiramate extended-release, an antiepileptic drug. Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, amphetamine. The effect of phentermine on chronic weight management is likely mediated by release of catecholamines in the hypothalamus, resulting in reduced appetite and decreased food consumption, but other metabolic effects may also be involved. The exact mechanism of action is not known. The precise mechanism of action of topiramate on chronic weight management is not known. Topiramateâ€™s effect on chronic weight management may be due to its effects on both appetite suppression and satiety enhancement, induced by a combination of pharmacologic effects including augmenting the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyrate, modulation of voltage-gated ion channels, inhibition of AMPA/kainite excitatory glutamate receptors, or inhibition of carbonic anhydrase.

Nutrition and Weight Loss,Redux (dexfenfluramine hydrochloride),"General Information
Redux, when combined with a reduced-calorie diet, has been indicated for the management of obesity, including weight loss and maintenance of that weight loss. The safety and effectiveness of Redux beyond one year have not been determined at this time.
Redux is recommended for obese subjects with an initial body mass index (BMI) of at least 30 kg/m2 (which is approximately 30% over desirable weight) or a BMI of at least 27 kg/m2 (which is approximately 20% over desirable weight) in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia). Redux is available by physician's prescription in 15 mg capsules to be taken twice daily.
Clinical Results
In clinical trials, Redux therapy was associated with decreased appetite and may make people feel full and lessen their desire to eat.
In a large, one-year clinical trial of more than 900 subjects, individuals taking Redux in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet loss significantly more weight than subjects on diet and placebo. Redux helped produce a significant reduction in weight during the first four to six months. This response was maintained during a year of therapy. At the end of the year, 64% of all subjects lost at least 5% of their initial total weight, 40% lost at least 10%, and 21% lost at least 15%. In a study of 60 obese subjects who had successfully lost weight by dieting alone (i.e., lost at least ten pounds in the previous year), the addition of Redux to their regimen resulted in the further loss of 26% of initial excess weight.
","Side Effects
The most commonly reported side effects in clinical trials included drowsiness, diarrhea, and dry mouth. These side effects were usually mild and disappeared in a few weeks.
There is a low incidence of a serious, potentially life-threatening cardiovascular condition, primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), associated with the use of all types of prescription weight loss drugs (anorexigens). A two-year study looked to investigate all incidences of PPH in Europe and identified 95 cases: 20 of these had been exposed to anorexigens in the past. Eighteen of the 20 cases identified a history of dexfenfluramine use. In an initial review of these cases (excluding ten additional cases where the specific drug or dates of use were unknown), the use of anorexigens for longer than three months was associated with a nine-fold increase in the risk of PPH. Therefore, the risk of PPH in obese subjects was estimated to be at least 18 cases per 1,000,000 subjects per year. The authors of the initial review are continuing to analyze the data. In the general population, the yearly occurrence of PPH is one to two cases per one million people.
Redux should not be used in subjects hypersensitive to dexfenfluramine or related compounds, in subjects with diagnosed pulmonary hypertension, or in subjects taking (or without 14 days of discontinuing) monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Redux should not be administered to patients using other serotoninergic drugs. Redux is not recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing or for pediatric subjects.
",,"Mechanism of Action
The mechanism of action of Redux is based upon its effects on serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain. Redux works primarily by decreased caloric intake associated with increased activity of serotonin in the brain."

Saxenda (liraglutide [rDNA origin] injection) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and calorie intake, and the GLP-1 receptor is present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation.
Saxenda is specifically indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obese), or 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition (e.g.,hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia).
Saxenda is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous administration. The recommended dose of Saxenda is 3 mg daily. Administer at any time of day, without regard to the timing of meals. Dosing should be initiated at 0.6 mg per day for one week. Increase the dose in weekly intervals until a dose of 3 mg is reached. Saxenda should be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. The injection site and timing can be changed without dose adjustment.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Saxenda for chronic weight management was based on three 56-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In all studies, Saxenda was titrated to 3 mg daily during a 4-week period. All patients received instruction for a reduced calorie diet (approximately 500 kcal/day deficit) and exercise counseling (recommended increase in physical activity of minimum 150 mins/week) that began with the first dose of study medication or placebo and continued throughout the trial. Study 1 was a 56-week trial that enrolled 3,731 patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2) or with overweight (BMI 27-29.9 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition such as treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. Study 2 was a 56-week trial that enrolled 635 patients with type 2 diabetes and with either overweight or obesity (as defined above). Patients were to have an HbA1c of 7-10% and be treated with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or a glitazone as single agent or in any combination, or with diet and exercise alone. Study 3 was a 56-week trial that enrolled 422 patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2) or with overweight (BMI 27-29.9 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition such as treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. All patients were first treated with a low-calorie diet (total energy intake 1200-1400 kcal/day) in a run-in period lasting up to 12 weeks. Patients who lost at least 5% of their screening body weight after 4 to 12 weeks during the run-in were then randomized, with equal allocation, to receive either Saxenda or placebo for 56 weeks. The subjects in Studies ! and 2 also received either Saxenda or placebo for 56 weeks. The proportions of patients who discontinued study drug in the 56-week trials were 27% for the Saxenda-treated group and 35% for the placebo-treated group. Approximately 10% of patients treated with Saxenda and 4% of patients treated with placebo discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction.
Study Results:
For Study 1 and Study 2, the primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in body weight and the percentages of patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% and 10% weight loss from baseline to week 56. For Study 3, the primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in body weight from randomization to week 56, the percentage of patients not gaining more than 0.5% body weight from randomization to week 56, and the percentage of patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% weight loss from randomization to week 56. After 56 weeks, treatment with Saxenda resulted in a statistically significant reduction in weight compared with placebo. Statistically significantly greater proportions of patients treated with Saxenda achieved 5% and 10% weight loss than those treated with placebo. In Study 3, statistically significantly more patients randomized to Saxenda than placebo had not gained more than 0.5% of body weight from randomization to week 56.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Saxenda may include, but are not limited to, the following:
nausea
hypoglycemia
diarrhea
constipation
vomiting
headache

Liraglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice. It is unknown whether Saxenda causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. Saxenda is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).
",,"Mechanism of Action
Saxenda is an acylated human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and calorie intake, and the GLP-1 receptor is present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation. In animal studies, peripheral administration of liraglutide resulted in the presence of liraglutide in specific brain regions regulating appetite, including the hypothalamus. Although liraglutide activated neurons in brain regions known to regulate appetite, specific brain regions mediating the effects of liraglutide on appetite were not identified in rats.

Tanzeum (albiglutide) is an agonist of the albumin-based glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 fusion protein. It augments glucose-dependent insulin secretion and slows gastric emptying.
Tanzeum is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes mellitus.
Tanzeum is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous injection. The recommended dose is 30 mg once weekly given as a subcutaneous injection in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm region. The dosage may be increased to 50 mg once weekly if the glycemic response is inadequate. Tanzeum may be administered at any time of day without regard to meals. It should be administered once a week on the same day each week. The day of weekly administration may be changed if necessary as long as the last dose was administered 4 or more days before. If a dose is missed, Tanzeum should be administered as soon as possible within 3 days after the missed dose. Thereafter, dosing can resume on the usual day of administration. If it is more than 3 days after the missed dose, dosing should wait until the next regularly scheduled weekly dose.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Tanzeum was based on a 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. A total of 296 subjects with type 2II diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise were randomized Tanzeum 30 mg SC once weekly, Tanzeum 30 mg SC once weekly uptitrated to 50 mg once weekly at Week 12, or placebo. Compared with placebo, treatment with Tanzeum 30 mg or 50 mg resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c from baseline at Week 52. The adjusted mean change in weight from baseline did not differ significantly between Tanzeum (-0.4 to -0.9 kg) and placebo (-0.7 kg) at Week 52.
","Side Effects

Nutrition and Weight Loss,Trulicity (dulaglutide),"General Information
Trulicity (dulaglutide) is a glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor agonist. Dulaglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) in beta cells leading to glucose-dependent insulin release. Dulaglutide also decreases glucagon secretion and slows gastric emptying.
Trulicity is specifically indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Trulicity is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous injection. The recommended initiating dose is 0.75 mg once weekly. The dose may be increased to 1.5 mg once weekly for additional glycemic control. The maximum recommended dose is 1.5 mg once weekly. Administer Trulicity once weekly, any time of day, with or without food. Trulicity should be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Trulicity was based on a 52-week double-blind study (26 week primary endpoint). The study enrolled 807 patients inadequately treated with diet and exercise, or with diet and exercise and one anti-diabetic agent used at submaximal dose. The subjects were randomized to Trulicity 0.75 mg once weekly, Trulicity 1.5 mg once weekly, or metformin 1500 to 2000 mg/day following a two week washout. Treatment with Trulicity 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg once weekly resulted in reduction in HbA1c from baseline at the 26 week primary timepoint. The difference in observed effect size between Trulicity 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg, respectively, and metformin excluded the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 0.4%.

"Macular degeneration, dry",Beovu (brolucizumab-dbll),"General Information
Beovu (brolucizumab-dbll) is a human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor.
Beovu is specifically indicated for the treatment of Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD).
Beovu is supplied as a solution for intravitreal injection. The recommended dose is 6 mg (0.05 mL of 120 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection monthly (approximately every 25-31 days) for the first three doses, followed by 6 mg (0.05 mL) by intravitreal injection once every 8-12 weeks.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Beovu was based on the phase 3 HAWK and HARRIER trials. The 96-week prospective, randomized, double-masked multi-center studies were designed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injections of brolucizumab 6 mg (HAWK and HARRIER) and 3 mg (HAWK only) versus aflibercept 2 mg in patients with wet AMD. The trials enrolled over 1,800 patients across nearly 400 centers worldwide. In both trials patients on Beovu achieved vision gains that were non-inferior to Regeneronâ€™s Eylea (aflibercept) at year one with longer treatment intervals in a majority of patients. In both clinical trials, approximately 30% of patients gained at least 15 letters at year one. Beovu showed greater reduction in central subfield thickness (CST) as early as week 16 and at year one, and fewer patients had intra-retinal (IRF) and/or sub-retinal fluid (SRF). Retinal fluid is a key marker of disease activity. In both trials eligible patients could be maintained on a three-month dosing interval immediately after the loading phase. At year one, over half of patients were maintained on the three-month dosing interval (56% in HAWK and 51% in HARRIER). The remaining patients in the study were treated on a two-month dosing schedule.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Beovu may include, but are not limited to, the following:
vision blurred

",,"Mechanism of Action
Beovu (brolucizumab-dbll) is a human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor. Brolucizumab binds to the three major isoforms of VEGF-A (e.g., VEGF110, VEGF121, and VEGF165), thereby preventing interaction with receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. By inhibiting VEGF-A, brolucizumab suppresses endothelial cell proliferation, neovascularization, and vascular permeability.

"Macular degeneration, dry",Eylea (aflibercept),"General Information
Eylea (aflibercept) is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human . Vascular endothelial growth (VEGF) receptors 1 and 2. VEGF-A is a member of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. Activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in neovascularization and vascular permeability.
Eylea is specifically approved for neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration.
Eylea is supplied as a solution for intravitreal injection. The recommended dose is 2 mg (0.05 mL or 50 microliters) administered by intravitreal injection every four weeks (monthly) for the first 12 weeks (three months), followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (two months).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA Approval of Eylea was based on two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, active-controlled studies, VIEW1 and VIEW2. A total of 2,412 subjects were treated and evaluable for efficacy. The subjects were randomized to one of four dosing regimens: 1) Eylea administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following three initial monthly doses (Eylea 2Q8); 2) Eylea administered 2 mg every four weeks (Eylea 2Q4); 3) Eylea 0.5 mg administered every four weeks (Eylea 0.5Q4); and 4) ranibizumab administered 0.5 mg every four weeks (ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects who maintained vision, defined as losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at week 52 compared to baseline. Both Eylea 2Q8 and 2Q4 groups were shown to have efficacy that was clinically equivalent to the ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4 group. In VIEW1 this endpoint was reached by 94%, 95% and 94% of subjects in the Eylea 2Q8, Eylea 2Q4 and ranibizumab arms, respectively.

Eylea (aflibercept) is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 formulated as an iso-osmotic solution for intravitreal administration. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is a member of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. Activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in neovascularization and vascular permeability.

Macular Edema,Eylea (aflibercept),"General Information
Eylea (aflibercept) is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor.
Eylea is specifically indicated for the treatment of macular edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), which includes macular edema following Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) in addition to the previously-approved indication of macular edema following Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO).
Eylea is supplied as an injection for intravitreal injection. The recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg (0.05 mL or 50 microliters) administered by intravitreal injection once every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Eylea for the treatment of macular edema following CRVO was based on two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, sham-controlled studies: COPERNICUS (Controlled Phase 3 Evaluation of Repeated intravitreal administration of VEGF Trap-Eye In Central retinal vein occlusion: Utility and Safety) and GALILEO (General Assessment Limiting Infiltration of Exudates in central retinal vein Occlusion with EYLEA). A total of 358 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy. In both studies, patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to either 2 mg Eylea administered every 4 weeks (Q4), or sham injections (control group) administered every 4 weeks for a total of 6 injections. After 6 monthly injections, patients continued to receive Eylea treatment during weeks 24 to 52 only if they met pre-specified retreatment criteria (PRN), except for patients in the sham control group in the GALILEO study who continued to receive sham injections through week 52. Patients ranged in age from 22 to 89 years with a mean of 64 years. In the COPERNICUS study, after six months, 56% of patients receiving Eylea 2 mg monthly gained at least 15 letters of Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) from baseline, as measured by ETDRS, compared to 12% of patients receiving sham injections (p < 0.01), the primary endpoint of the study. In the GALILEO study, after six months, 60% of patients receiving Eylea 2 mg monthly for the first 6 months, gained at least 15 letters of BCVA from baseline, compared to 22% of patients receiving sham injections (p < 0.01) during this time, the primary endpoint of the study.
The FDA approval of Eylea for Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion was based on the double-masked, randomized, controlled Phase 3 VIBRANT study of 181 patients with Macular Edema following BRVO. The VIBRANT study compared Eylea 2 mg once every 4 weeks with macular laser photocoagulation (control). At 24 weeks, significantly more patients treated with Eylea gained at least 15 letters in vision (three lines on an eye chart) from baseline as measured on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, the primary endpoint of the study, compared with patients who received control (53 percent vs. 27 percent).

Male Hormonal Deficiencies/Abnormalities,Aveed (testosterone undecanoate) injection,"General Information
Aveed (testosterone undecanoate) injection is an ester of the androgen, testosterone. Endogenous androgens, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics.
Aveed is specifically indicated for testosterone replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone: primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or acquired).
Aveed is supplied as a solution for intramuscular administration. The recommended dose of Aveed is 3 mL (750 mg) injected intramuscularly, followed by 3 mL (750 mg) injected after 4 weeks, then 3 mL (750 mg) injected every 10 weeks thereafter. Aveed should be injected deeply into the gluteal muscle.

FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Aveed was based on an 84-week, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study which enrolled 130 hypogonadal adult men with morning serum total testosterone concentrations <300 ng/dL (mean screening testosterone concentration 215 ng/dL). All subjects received injections of Aveed 750 mg at baseline, at 4 weeks, and then every 10 weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects with average serum total testosterone concentration (Cavg) within the normal range (300-1000 ng/dL) after the third injection, at steady state. A total of 117 out of 130 subjects completed study procedures through Week 24 and were included in the evaluation of testosterone pharmacokinetics after the third Aveed injection. Ninety-four percent (94%) of subjects maintained a Cavg within the normal range (300 to 1000 ng/dL). The secondary endpoint was the percentage of subjects with maximum total testosterone concentration (Cmax) above three preÂ­determined limits: greater than 1500 ng/dL, between 1800 and 2499 ng/dL, and greater than 2500 ng/dL. The percentage of subjects with Cmax >1500 ng/dL was 7.7%; none of the subjects had a Cmax >1800 ng/dL.

Simple and Complex Absence Seizures
Therapy should be initiated at 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at 1-week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in 2 to 3 doses.
Migraine
The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily. Some patients may benefit from doses up to 1000 mg/day.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Stavzor was based on the following clinical trials:
Mania
Stavzor was evaluated in two 3-week, placebo controlled, parallel group studies.
Study One
This study enrolled adult subjects who received valproate at a dose of 250 mg TID and adjusted to achieve serum valproate concentrations in a range of 50-100 mcg/mL by day 7. The treatment period was three weeks (21 days). The subjects were subsequently assessed on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS; score ranges from 0-60), an augmented Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-A), and the Global Assessment Scale (GAS). Valproate was statistically significantly superior to placebo on all three measures of outcome. Sixty percent of the subjects showed at least a 30% reduction in symptom score from baseline compared to 26% of the placebo group (p<0.05).
Study Two
This study enrolled adult subjects who received valproate at a dose of 250 mg TID and adjusted within a dose range of 750-2500 mg/day to achieve serum valproate concentrations in a range of 40-150 mcg/mL. The treatment duration was three weeks (21 days). Study 2 also included a lithium group for which lithium doses for completers were 1312, 1869, and 1984 mg/day at Days 7, 14, and 21, respectively. Subjects were assessed on the Manic Rating Scale (MRS; score ranges from 11-63), and the primary outcome measures were the total MRS score, and scores for 2 subscales of the MRS. Valproate was statistically significantly superior to placebo on all three measures of outcome. Fifty-eight percent of the subjects showed at least a 30% reduction in symptom score from baseline compared to 29% of the placebo group (p<0.05).
Epilepsy
Stavzor was evaluated in two clinical trials.
Study One
This multiclinic, placebo-controlled study employing an add-on design, (adjunctive therapy), enrolled 144 subjects who continued to suffer 8 or more controlled partial seizures (CPS) per 8 weeks during an 8week period of monotherapy with doses of either carbamazepine or phenytoin. The subjects were randomized to receive either valproate or placebo in addition to their original antiepilepsy drug. They were followed for 16 weeks. The results are as follows: the median baseline incidence of CPS per 8 weeks was 16.0 for the valproate arm and 14.5 for the placebo arm. Following treatment, the median was reduced to 8.9 for the valproate arm and 11.5 for the placebo arm. The reduction from baseline was statistically significantly greater for valproate than placebo (p < 0.05).
Study Two
This study was designed to assess the capacity of valproate to reduce the incidence of CPS when administered as the sole AED. All enrolled subjects experienced 2 or more CPS per 4 weeks during an 8- to 12 weeklong period of monotherapy with adequate doses of an AED and made a successful transition over a 2 week interval to valproate. The subjects gradually tapered off their concomitant AED, were randomized to either a high dose or low dose valproate group (mean total of 71 and 123 mcg/mL) and followed for as long as 22 weeks. The monotherapy study median incidence of CPS per 8 weeks at baseline was 13.2 in the high dose arm and 14.2 in the low dose arm. Following treatment, the median CPS incidence was reduced to 10.7 in the high dose arm and 13.8 in the low dose arm. The reduction from baseline was statistically significantly greater for high dose than low dose (p = 0.05).
Migraine
Stavzor was evaluated in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Both studies enrolled subjects with a history of migraine with or without aura (of at least 6 months in duration) who were experiencing at least 2 migraine headaches a month during the 3 months prior to enrollment. Each study was comprised of a 4-week single-blind placebo baseline period after which they were randomized, under double blind conditions, to valproate or placebo for a 12-week treatment phase, comprised of a 4-week dose titration period followed by an 8-week maintenance period.
Study One
This study enrolled 107 subjects, 90 of whom completed the 8-week maintenance period. Valproate doses ranged from 500 to 2500 mg a day. Doses over 500 mg were given in three divided doses (TID). The mean dose during the treatment phase was 1087 mg/day. The mean 4-week migraine headache rate during the treatment phase was 5.7 in the placebo group compared to 3.5 in the valproate group, a significant difference.
Study Two
This study enrolled 176 subjects, 137 of whom completed the 8-week maintenance period. The subjects were randomized equally to one of three valproate dose groups (500, 1000, or 1500 mg/day) or placebo. The treatments were given in two divided doses (BID). The initial dose was 250 mg daily. The regimen was advanced by 250 mg every 4 days (8 days for 500 mg/day group), until the randomized dose was achieved. Efficacy was determined by a comparison of the 4-week migraine headache rate in the combined 1000/1500 mg/day group and placebo group. The mean 4-week migraine headache rates during the treatment phase, adjusted for differences in baseline rates, were 4.5 in the placebo group, compared to 3.3, 3.0, and 3.3 in the valproate 500, 1000, and 1500 mg/day groups, respectively. The rates in the combined valproate 1000/1500 mg group were significantly lower than in the placebo group.

Mantle Cell Lymphoma,Brukinsa (zanubrutinib),"General Information
Brukinsa (zanubrutinib) is a kinase inhibitor.
Brukinsa is specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy.
Brukinsa is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended dose is 160 mg taken orally twice daily or 320 mg taken orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Brukinsa can be taken with or without food. Capsules should be swallowed whole with water. Capsules should not be opened, broken or chewed. If a dose of Brukinsa is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a return to the normal schedule the following day.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Brukinsa was approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.
A single-arm clinical trial of Brukinsa included 86 patients with mantle cell lymphoma who had received at least one prior treatment. The trial measured how many patients experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors after treatment (overall response rate). In the trial, 84% of patients had tumor shrinkage with a median duration of response (time between the initial response to therapy and subsequent disease progression or relapse) of 19.5 months. This trial was supported by an additional single-arm trial that included 32 patients, in which 84% of patients had tumor shrinkage with a median duration of response of 18.5 months.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Brukinsa may include, but are not limited to, the following:
neutrophil count decreased
platelet count decreased
upper respiratory tract infection
white blood cell count decreased
hemoglobin decreased
rash
bruising
diarrhea

Mantle Cell Lymphoma,Revlimid (lenalidomide),"General Information
Revlimid (lenalidomide) is an orally available thalidomide analog, exerting both anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory properties.
Revlimid is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
Revlimid is supplied as an opaque capsule for oral administration. Recommended dosing is 10 mg daily with water. Dosing may be reduced (to 5 mg once daily or once every other day) or temporarily suspended if incidence of thrombocytopenia or neutropenia is observed (see ","Side Effects, below).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Approval of Revlimid was based on results of an open-label, single arm, multi-center study that enrolled 148 patients with red-blood-cell-transfusion dependent anemia due to low-or intermediate-1- risk MDS associated with a 5 q (q31-33) cytogenetic abnormality in isolation or with additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Subjects received 10 mg Revlimid once daily either continuously or for 21 of every 28 days. Sequential dose reductions, to 5 mg daily and 5 mg every other day, were permitted to mitigate toxicities. The drug was shown to be efficacious in reducing the need for red-blood cell transfusions: 67% (n=99/148) of patients experienced a period of at least 8 weeks during which no transfusion was needed, and the median duration of transfusion independence was maintained for a median 44 weeks. 90% of responders experienced onset of transfusion independence within 3 months. Dose interruption or reduction due to toxicity was necessary in 79.7% of patients (n=118/148).
Ongoing Study Commitments
The embryo-fetal toxicity assessment of Revlimid has not been adequately addressed. Celgene has agreed to provide adequate information for this assessment in appropriate models designed to fully assess the possible toxicity of Revlimid. Celgene plans to conduct these studies in two different species that are appropriate to assess the full range of thalidomide embryo-fetal effects. As discussed, the rat is not an acceptable model. If the study with lenalidomide in the first species shows clear evidence of teratogenesis, than a confirmatory study will not be necessary. Although not generally considered definitive test systems for pharmaceutical products, additional studies of an exploratory nature on the embryo-fetal effects of lenalidomide may be useful.
Protocol Submission: June 2006
Study Start: September 2006
Final Report Submission: December 2007
Celgene has agreed to submit the study report and data from the ongoing study, CC-5013-MDS-004, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 3-arm study of the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of lenalidomide (5 mg daily versus 10 mg day 21 days of a 28 day cycle) versus placebo in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent patients with low-or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality when completed.
Protocol Submission: March 2005
Study Start: August 2005
Final Report Submission: December 2008
Following Revlimid dosing, approximately 2/3 of lenalidomide is excreted as unchanged drug in urine. In multiple myeloma patients with mild renal impairment, exposure (plasma AUC) was 56% higher than in similar patients with normal renal function who received the same dose. Based on these data, Celgene has agreed to conduct a study to determine the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide in subjects with renal impairment.

Celgene has agreed to submit all exposed pregnancies within 15 days of receipt as 15 day expedited reports.
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Revlimid or myelodysplastic syndromes, please visit the Revlimid web page.","Mechanism of Action
The exact mechanism of Revlimid's activity has not been fully detailed. In-vitro and in-vivo studies indicated that the drug both inhibited the secretion of pro inflammatory cytokines and promoted the secretion of anti inflammatory cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The drug also inhibited expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) but not COX-1 in vitro. Additional antiproliferative activity was noted in some, but not all, human cell lines. The drug effectively inhibited growth of Namalwa cells, a human B cell lymphoma cell line with a deletion of one chromosome 5, but was much less effective in inhibiting the KG-1 human myeloblastic cell line (which also has a deletion of one chromosome 5), and other cell lines without chromosome 5 deletions.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.
The efficacy was Keytruda was evaluated in an open label, randomized, comparative dose trial in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with progression of disease; refractory to two or more doses of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg or higher) and, if BRAF V600 mutation-positive, a BRAF or MEK inhibitor; and disease progression within 24 weeks following the last dose of ipilimumab. The subjects were randomized to receive 2 mg/kg (n=89) or 10 mg/kg (n=84) of Keytruda every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression that was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at 4 to 6 weeks with repeat imaging. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 12 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed overall response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded independent central review and duration of response. The ORR was 24% (95% confidence interval: 15, 34) in the 2 mg/kg arm, consisting of 1 complete response and 20 partial responses. Among the 21 subjects with an objective response, 3 (14%) had progression of disease 2.8, 2.9, and 8.2 months after initial response. The remaining 18 subjects (86%) had ongoing responses with durations ranging from 1.4+ to 8.5+ months, which included 8 subjects with ongoing responses of 6 months or longer. One additional subject developed two new asymptomatic lesions at the first tumor assessment concurrent with a 75% decrease in overall tumor burden; Keytruda was continued and this reduction in tumor burden was durable for 5+ months. There were objective responses in subjects with and without BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma. Similar ORR results were observed in the 10 mg/kg arm.

Mekinist (trametinib) is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activation and of MEK1 and MEK2 kinase activity. MEK proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway, which promotes cellular proliferation. BRAF V600E mutations result in constitutive activation of the BRAF pathway which includes MEK1 and MEK2. Trametinib inhibits BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo.

Melanoma,Opdivo (nivolumab),"General Information
Opdivo (nivolumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production.
Opdivo is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.
Opdivo is supplied as a solution for intravenous administration. The recommended dose of Opdivo is 3 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every two weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Opdivo was approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. The FDA approval of Opdivo for melanoma was based on a multicenter, open-label trial that randomized patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma to receive either Opdivo administered intravenously at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or investigatorâ€™s choice of chemotherapy, either single-agent dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or the combination of carboplatin AUC 6 every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Patients were required to have progression of disease on or following ipilimumab treatment and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. Tumor assessments were conducted 9 weeks after randomization then every 6 weeks for the first year, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Efficacy was evaluated in a single-arm, non-comparative, planned interim analysis of the first 120 patients who received Opdivo and in whom the minimum duration of follow up was 6 months. The major efficacy outcome measures in this population were confirmed objective response rate (ORR) as measured by blinded independent central review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) and duration of response. The ORR was 32%, consisting of 4 complete responses and 34 partial responses in Opdivo-treated patients. Of 38 patients with responses, 33 (87%) had ongoing responses with durations ranging from 2.6+ to 10+ months, which included 13 patients with ongoing responses of 6 months or longer. There were objective responses in patients with and without BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma.
","Side Effects
The most common adverse reaction associated with the use of Opdivo was rash.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Opdivo (nivolumab) is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors.

Melanoma,Yervoy (ipilimumab),"General Information
Yervoy (ipilimumab) is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), a molecule on T cells that suppresses the immune response. Blockade of CTLA-4 augments T-cell activation and proliferation and ipilimumab works via T-cell mediated anti-tumor immune responses.
Yervoy is specifically indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
Yervoy is supplied as a solution for intravenous administration. The recommended dose of Yervoy is 3 mg/kg administered intravenously over 90 minutes every three weeks for a total of four doses.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Yervoy was based on a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study in 676 previously treated subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The subjects received Yervoy alone, Yervoy plus an investigational peptide vaccine gp100, or the gp100 vaccine alone. Yervoy was administered at 3 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion every three weeks for four doses. Gp100 was administered at a dose of 2 mg peptide by deep subcutaneous injection every three weeks for four doses. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the Yervoy plus gp100 arm versus the gp100 monotherapy arm. Assessment of tumor response to Yervoy was conducted at weeks 12 and 24, and every three months thereafter. Survival rate at 1 year was 46% in the Yervoy arm vs. 25% in the gp100 arm. The estimated survival rate at 2 years was 24% in the Yervoy arm vs. 14% in the gp100 arm. Subjects treated with Yervoy had a 34% reduction in the risk of death over the gp100 control arm and those treated with Yervoy plus gp100 had a 32% reduction in the risk of death over the gp100 control arm. Median overall survival was 10, 10 and 6 months for the Yervoy alone, Yervoy + gp100 arm and gp100 alone arms, respectively.

Menopause,Activella (Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate) Tablets,"General Information
Activella has been approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with an intact uterus for prevention of osteoporosis. It is also indicated for several other symptoms associated with menopause, such as severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Activella is a combination hormone replacement therapy (HRT) tablet containing both estrogen and progestin. The tablet is administered once daily with a dosage of 1 mg of the estrogen (17beta-estradiol) and 0.5 mg of the progestin (norethindrone acetate).
Activella has already been approved in Europe for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis and has been marketed there under the name Activelle or Kliovance. Pharmacia & Upjohn, under terms of an agreement with Novo Nordisk, will be marketing the new HRT in the U.S.
Clinical Results
The effects of Activella on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) was investigated in the U.S. and in Europe in two multi-center, placebo-controlled studies. Participants were all postmenopausal women with intact uteri and baseline BMD values for lumbar spine within two standard deviations of the mean in healthy young women. Patients were randomized to groups given different dosages of either estradiol alone, norethindrone alone, a combination of the two (Activella), or placebo. Treatment was supplemented with calcium (500-1000 mg/day). In the United States and European studies, the mean percentage change in BMD between Activella and placebo was 5.9% and 6.3%, respectively.
Also, Activella yielded a statistically significant reduction in serum and urine markers of bone turnover. This effect was apparent after three months of treatment and was retained for the entire two-year treatment period.
","Side Effects
Common side effects include:
Breast tenderness/pain
Upper respiratory tract infections
Headache
Postmenopausal bleeding
Women who have been diagnosed with the following, should NOT take Activella:
Known or suspected pregnancy
Breast cancer
Estrogen- dependent neoplasia
Active deep vein thrombosis
Thromboembolic disorders or stroke
Undiagnosed genital bleeding
Liver dysfunction or disease
Hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients in the drug
Women who have had hysterectomies should NOT take Activella, as the existing data suggests that the combination therapy of estrogen and progestin may increase risk of glucose intolerance and less favorable effects on lipid metabolism in women without a uterus.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism, and estrogen replacement therapy acts to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.
Progestin compounds enhance cellular differentiation and generally oppose the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels, increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites, or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen. Progestins exert their effects in target cells by binding to specific progesterone receptors that interact with progesterone response elements in target genes. Progesterone receptors have been identified in the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, and central nervous system. Progestins produce similar endometrial changes to those of the naturally occurring hormone progesterone.

Bijuva is specifically indicated for use in women with a uterus for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause.
Bijuva is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended dose is a single capsule, 1 mg/100 mg, orally each evening with food.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Bijuva was based on the phase III Replenish Trial which evaluated four doses of Bijuva and placebo in 1,835 post-menopausal women between 40 and 65 years old. The Replenish Trial results demonstrated: Two Bijuva doses (estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg) and (estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg) achieved all of the co-primary efficacy endpoints and the primary safety endpoint. Both doses demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in both the frequency and severity of hot flashes compared to placebo, and the primary safety endpoint: the incidence of consensus endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy was 0 percent. In addition, both doses met the secondary endpoints using well-validated patient reported outcome tools, including the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL), the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI), and the responder analysis rate.
","Side Effects

Estrogen plus progestin therapy may increase the risk of the following: cardiovascular disorders (including stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction; invasive breast cancer and probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age of older. Estrogen-Alone Therapy may increase the risk of the following: endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens, stroke and DVT and probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Bijuva is a bio-identical hormone therapy combination of an estrogen and progesterone. Bio-identical refers to estradiol and progesterone that are molecularly identical to the hormones circulating naturally in the womanâ€™s body. As the ovaries stop producing hormones, levels of circulating estrogen and progesterone decrease, often causing vasomotor symptoms (VMS) such as night sweats, hot flashes, and sleep disturbances.

Duavee pairs conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene. Bazedoxifene (TSE-424) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) designed to mimic the beneficial qualities of estrogens, while blocking estrogen in tissues where it can be harmful. The pairing of conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene produces a composite effect that is specific to each target tissue.
Duavee is specifically indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
Duavee is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is one tablet once a day.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Duavee was based on the following clinical trials:
Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms Associated with Menopause
A double blind, randomized placebo controlled trial enrolled 318 women ages 42 to 64 with at least 7 moderate to severe hot flashes per day or 50 per week at baseline. Duavee significantly reduced the number and severity of moderate to severe hot flushes, as measured by the daily severity score, compared with placebo at Weeks 4 and 12.
Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis
Two studies were conducted: Study 1 and 2. Study 1 was a 24-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of multiple combinations of conjugated estrogen/bazedoxifene (including conjugated estrogens 0.45 mg/bazedoxifene 20 mg) compared to placebo. A total of 3,397 women were enrolled. Duavee significantly increased lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at 24 months compared to placebo. Duavee also significantly increased total hip BMD. The treatment difference (or difference from placebo) in total hip BMD at 24 months was 1.96% (Duavee minus placebo) in women who had been postmenopausal between 1 and 5 years and 1.73% (Duavee minus placebo) in women who had been postmenopausal for more than 5 years. Study 2 was a 12-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled study. Duavee significantly increased mean lumbar spine BMD (treatment difference, 1.51%), at 12 months compared to placebo in women who had been postmenopausal between 1 and 5 years. Treatment with Duavee also increased total hip BMD. The treatment difference in total hip BMD at 12 months was 1.21%. The effect of Duavee on endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial malignancy were also assessed in Study 1 and Study 2. By endometrial biopsy, the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy for Duavee was below 1% in both studies.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Duavee may include, but are not limited to, the following:
muscle spasms
nausea
diarrhea
dyspepsia
abdominal pain
oropharyngeal pain
dizziness
neck pain
",,"Mechanism of Action
Duavee pairs conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene. Conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene function by binding to and activating estrogen receptors (ER) a and ÃŸ, which vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Conjugated estrogens are composed of multiple estrogens and are agonists of ER- a and ÃŸ. Bazedoxifene is an estrogen agonist/antagonist that acts as an agonist in some estrogen-sensitive tissues and an antagonist in others. The pairing of conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene produces a composite effect that is specific to each target tissue. The bazedoxifene component reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia that can occur with the conjugated estrogens component.

Menopause,Elestrin (estradiol gel),"General Information
Elestrin (estradiol gel) is a gel formulation of estradiol (the bio-identical human estrogen) designed to be absorbed through the skin after application on the arms, shoulders, thighs or abdomen, delivering estradiol to the blood stream evenly over time in a non-invasive and painless manner. Estrogens are secreted by a woman's ovaries and are responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. The ovaries stop making estrogens when a woman is between the ages of 45 and 55. This drop in estrogen levels causes the symptoms commonly seen in menopause, including hot flashes.
Elestrin is specifically indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.
Elestrin is supplied as a hydroalcoholic gel for topical administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is one pump per day or (0.87 g/day, which contains 0.52 mg of estradiol). The dose may be escalated based on individual response.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Elestrin was based on the results of a phase III trial evaluating Elestrin in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 484 postmenopausal women between 28 and 74 years of age who had at least 60 moderate-to-severe hot flushes per week at baseline. Subjects applied placebo, Elestrin 0.87 g (0.52 mg estradiol), 1.7 g (1.02 mg estradiol), or 2.6 g (1.56 mg estradiol) once daily to the upper arm for 12 weeks. Statistical significance was seen in both the frequency and severity of hot flash symptoms in the Elestrin 1.7 g/day treatment group when compared to placebo at week four (P<0.0001) and week 12 (P<0.001). Elestrin 0.87 g/day reached statistical significance at week 12 versus placebo (P<0.0001).
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Elestrin may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Nasopharyngitis
Breast Tenderness
Metrorrhagia
Upper Respiratory Tract Infection
Nausea
Vaginal Discharge
Nipple Pain
Endometrial Hyperplasia
In addition, Elestrin was shown to cause elevated blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, impaired liver function, hypothyroidism, fluid retention, hypocalcemia, ovarian cancer, exacerbation of endometriosis and other conditions, photosensitivity and photoallergy. Finally, Estradiol absorption was increased when sunscreen was applied 10 minutes before Elestrin application. Sunscreen should not be applied to the same site until at least 25 minutes after the application of Elestrin.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Elestrin delivers estradiol (a bio-identical human estrogen) to the blood stream evenly over time in a non-invasive and painless manner. Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. They are secreted by a woman's ovaries and are responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. The ovaries stop making estrogens when a woman is between the ages of 45 and 55. This drop in estrogen levels causes the symptoms commonly seen in menopause, including hot flashes. Elestrin application raises the circulating estrogen levels thus relieving the vasomotor symptoms of menopause.

Menopause,EstroGel (estradiol gel 0.06%),"General Information
EstroGel is a topical gel containing 0.06% estradiol in an absorptive hydroalcoholic gel base, formulated to provide a controlled release of the hormone. It is designed to treat symptoms associated with menopause.
It is specifically indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, including hot flashes. It is also indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause, especially when the atrophy is concurrent to vasomotor symptoms.
The recommended topical dose of EstroGel is 1.25 g once daily, delivered via metered pump. Recommended application is to the posterior surface of the arm, from the back of the wrist to the shoulder.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of EstroGel for the treatment of monopausal vasomotor symptoms was based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling 145 women between 29 and 67 years of age. Subjects received either 1.25g EstroGel (n=72) or placebo (n=73) once daily for 12 weeks. Primary endpoint efficacies, measured by reduction in the occurrence of moderate-to-severe hot flashes and reduction in severity of hot flashes, were assessed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Results showed that EstroGel produced a statistically significant decrease in both the number and severity of hot flashes at 4 and 12 weeks (reduction at 8 weeks was not significant). Specifically, at 4 weeks, subjects receiving EstroGel experienced 0.85 fewer hot flashes per day, and a reduction in severity score of 0.32; at 12 weeks, EstroGel subjects experienced 1.71 fewer hot flashes and a severity score reduction of 0.49.
FDA approval of EstroGel for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy was based on results of vagina wall cytology examinations performed on all subjects at 12 weeks. A significant increase in superficial epithelial cells was observed for the EstroGel group; no significant increase was seen among the placebo group.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of EstroGel may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Infection
Abdominal Pain
Diarrhea

Menopause,Evamist (estradiol),"General Information
Evamist (estradiol) is a (MDTS) formulation of estradiol. Estradiol is an endogenous estrogen largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) seen in postmenopausal women. When applied to the skin, estradiol is absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream.
Evamist is specifically indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause.
Evamist is supplied as a metered-dose pump spray designed for trans-dermal administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is one, two or three sprays applied each morning to adjacent, non-overlapping areas on the inner surface of the forearm, starting near the elbow. Each spray contains 90 mcL which contains 1.53 mg of estradiol.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Evamist was based on the results of one clinical trial. This 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 454 postmenopausal women. The subjects were randomized to receive at least one dose of Evamist (one, two or three 90 mcL sprays) or placebo. The efficacy of Evamist based on a statistically significant and clinically significant (at least two per day or 14 per week difference) reduction in hot flush frequency and a statistically significant reduction in severity when compared to placebo.

Menopause,Femhrt Tablets,"General Information
femhrt 1/5 is a combination of an estrogen hormone, ethinyl estradiol, and a progestin hormone, norethindrone acetate. It should be used to relieve symptoms associated with menopause, and also for the prevention of osteoporosis.
For the treatment of menopausal symptoms:
Femhrt 1/5 will replace the dropping levels of estrogen in women experiencing menopause. The treatment will reduce moderate to severe symptoms, such as hot flashes or feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest. Femhrt should be taken to relieve these symptoms only as long as the symptoms persist, especially if patient is taking hormones for other reasons.
For the prevention of osteoporosisFemhrt is most effective in the prevention of osteoporosis (the thinning of the bones) when taken as part of an osteoporosis-prevention regimen, including exercise and calcium supplements.
Clinical Results
Although the full clinical trial profile was not available by the FDA, a study on 18 post-menopausal women tested the effects of the femhrt hormone replacement therapy in an altered dose (1mg NA/10mcg EE). Results indicated that the hormones were rapidly absorbed, with the highest plasma concentrations of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol occurring at 1 to 2 hours postdose. The 1/10 dose were generally found to be proportional to the marketed 1/5 dose.
","Side Effects
Taking estrogen-containing drugs increases the risk of cancer of the uterus, and may, under some conditions, increase the risk of breast cancer. Although the risk is not as severe when progestins accompany the estrogen (as in the femhrt 1/5 combination), patients taking femhrt should get regular check-ups and perform regular breast self-examinations. Gallbladder disease, blood clotting, and vaginal bleeding are all also possible serious side-effects to the hormone treatment.
Additional side-effects reported by women taking the estrogen hormone include:
nausea and vomiting, breast tenderness or enlargement, headache, retention of extra fluid (edema), runny nose, abdominal pain, enlargement of non-cancerous tumors (fibroids) of the uterus, skin rashes and other skin abnormalities.
",,"Mechanism of Action
After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulphate conjugated form, estrone sulphate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. The pharmacologic effects of ethinyl estradiol are similar to those of endognous estrogens. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogen replacement therapy acts to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.
Progestin compounds enhance cellular differentiation and generally oppose the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels, increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites, or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen. (FDA Label)
"
Menopause,FemPatch,"General Information
FemPatch has been approved for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Using a low, .025 mg dose of 17 beta-estradiol (a natural form of estrogen) in a thin, flexible once-weekly patch, Fem Patch provides relief of vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats.
FemPatch treats moderate to severe vasomotor menopausal symptoms using a patented matrix system that delivers estradiol through the skin in a consistent, low dose, reaching maximum blood levels within 24 hours and then maintaining constant blood levels for seven days.
FemPatch is a translucent, skin-like, rectangular-shaped laminated matrix system composed of three distinct layers. The recommended starting dose of FemPatch, when initiating estrogen replacement therapy in the management of vasomotor symptoms of menopause, is one patch every seven days. The buttocks is the preferred site of FemPatch application.
As with other estrogen replacement therapies, FemPatch may not be suitable for all patients and should not be used by women with any known or suspected pregnancy, breast cancer, or estrogen-dependent neoplasia; undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding; active thrombophlebitis; or thromboembolic disorders.
Clinical Results
In clinical trials, FemPatch was shown to effectively reduce vasomotor symptoms by consistently delivering a nominal .025 mg dose of estradiol. Two independent, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted with 324 surgically or naturally menopausal women (a mean of 80 hot flashes per week and a range of 56-140 hot flashes per week), showed that FemPatch significantly reduced the number of hot flashes. By week 123, hot flash frequency decreased from 80 hot flashes to 13 per week--a reduction of 84%. Reduction of hot flashes was significant as early as week two in some treatment groups, and by week three in all treatment groups.
","Side Effects
Clinical studies with FemPatch showed a low incidence of discontinuation due to skin effects (3%) or adhesion failure (less than 2%). Overall, discontinuation due to adverse events for FemPatch (2.8%) was comparable to placebo (2.8%). Side effects with FemPatch are similar to those seen with other estrogen replacement therapies. As with all estrogen products, there are possible common side effects such as: headache, nausea, abdominal cramps, fluid retention, irregular bleeding, breast tenderness, or increase or decrease in weight. Estrogens also have been reported to increase the risk of endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women.",,
Menopause,Imvexxy (estradiol vaginal inserts),"General Information
Imvexxy is a bio-identical vaginal estrogen. It is an estrogen replacement therapy.
Imvexxy is specifically indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, due to menopause.
Imvexxy is supplied as a vaginal insert containing 4 mcg or 10 mcg estradiol. The recommended dose is 1 vaginal insert daily for 2 weeks, followed by 1 insert twice weekly.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Imvexxy was based on a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial which enrolled 574 generally healthy postmenopausal women between 40 to 75 years of age who at baseline assessment had â‰¤5 percent superficial cells on a vaginal smear, a vaginal pH >5.0, and also identified, at baseline, moderate to severe dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom to her. Greater than 90% of women also reported moderate to severe vaginal dryness at baseline. Treatment groups included 4 mcg Imvexxy (n=191), 10 mcg Imvexxy (n=191), and placebo (n=192). All women were assessed for improvement in the mean change from Baseline to Week 12 for the co-primary efficacy variables of: most bothersome moderate to severe symptom of dyspareunia, percentage of vaginal superficial and percentage of vaginal parabasal cells on a vaginal smear, and vaginal pH. Imvexxy 4 mcg and 10 mcg inserts were statistically superior to placebo in reducing the severity of moderate to severe dyspareunia at Week 12. A statistically significant increase in the percentage of superficial cells and a corresponding statistically significant decrease in the percentage of parabasal cells on a vaginal smear was also demonstrated for Imvexxy 4 and 10 mcg inserts. The mean reduction in vaginal pH between Baseline and Week 12 was also statistically significant for Imvexxy 4 and 10 mcg inserts.
","Side Effects
The most common adverse effect associated with the use of Imvexxy is headache.
The Imvexxy drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning: Estrogen-Alone Therapy: There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens. Estrogen-alone therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia. The Womenâ€™s Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen-alone sub-study reported increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older. Estrogen Plus Progestin Therapy: Estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia. The WHI estrogen plus progestin sub-study reported increased risks of stroke, DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE) and myocardial infarction (MI). The WHI estrogen plus progestin sub-study reported increased risks of invasive breast cancer. The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older. Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Imvexxy is a bio-identical vaginal estrogen. Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level. The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women. Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Intrarosa for moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, due to menopause was based on two primary 12-week placebo-controlled efficacy trials. The trials enrolled 406 healthy postmenopausal women, 40 to 80 years of age, who identified moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse as their most bothersome symptom of VVA. The women were randomly assigned to receive Intrarosa or a placebo vaginal insert. All subjects were assessed for improvement from Baseline to Week 12 for four co-primary efficacy endpoints: most bothersome moderate to severe symptom of dyspareunia, the percentage of vaginal superficial cells, the percentage of parabasal cells, and vaginal pH. Intrarosa, when compared to placebo, was shown to reduce the severity of pain experienced during sexual intercourse.

Menopause,Osphena (ospemifene),"General Information
Osphena (ospemifene) is an estrogen agonist/antagonist with tissue selective effects. It binds to estrogen receptors, resulting in the activation of estrogenic pathways in some tissues and the blockade of estrogenic pathways in other tissues.
Osphena is specifically indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, due to menopause.
Osphena is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is one 60 mg tablet with food once daily. Use of Osphena should be for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks. For postmenopausal woman with a uterus, the addition of a progestin should be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need a progestin.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Osphena was based on three placebo-controlled clinical trials (two 12-week efficacy trials and one 52-week long-term safety trial).
Trial One
This 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study enrolled 826 generally healthy postmenopausal women between 41 to 81 years of age with at least one moderate to severe vaginal symptom. Treatment groups included 30 mg or 60 mg Osphena or placebo. All women were assessed for improvement in the mean change from Baseline to Week 12 for the co-primary efficacy variables of: most bothersome symptom (MBS) of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (defined by each individual), percentage of vaginal superficial and vaginal parabasal cells on a vaginal smear, and vaginal pH.
Trial Two
This 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study enrolled 919 generally healthy postmenopausal women between 41 to 79 years of age with moderate to severe vaginal dryness (dryness cohort) or moderate to severe dyspareunia (dyspareunia cohort). The subjects received 60 mg Osphena or placebo. Primary endpoints and study conduct were similar to those in Trial 1.
Trial Three
This 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long-term safety study enrolled 426 generally healthy postmenopausal women between 49 to 79 years of age with an intact uterus. Treatment groups included 60 mg Ospehna or placebo.
Study Results
In the 1st and 2nd clinical trial, the modified intent-to-treat population of women treated with Osphena when compared to placebo, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement (least square mean change from Baseline to Week 12) in the moderate to severe MBS of dyspareunia (1st trial p=0.0012, 2nd trial p<0.0001). A statistically significant increase in the proportion of superficial cells and a corresponding statistically significant decrease in the proportion of parabasal cells on a vaginal smear was also demonstrated (p<0.0001 for both). The mean reduction in vaginal pH between baseline and Week 12 was also statistically significant (p<0.0001). In the long-term safety study daily doses of 60mg of Ophena were well-tolerated with most treatment-emergent adverse events being mild or moderate in severity.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Osphena may include, but are not limited to, the following:
hot flush
vaginal discharge
muscle spasms
genital discharge
hyperhidrosis
",,"Mechanism of Action
Osphena (ospemifene) is an estrogen agonist/antagonist with tissue selective effects. Its biological actions are mediated through binding to estrogen receptors. This binding results in activation of estrogenic pathways in some tissues (agonism) and blockade of estrogenic pathways in others (antagonism).

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Premarin was based on the following studies:
Vasomotor symptoms
Data are from 2,805 postmenopausal women enrolled in the HOPE Study. The women were randomly assigned to one of eight treatment groups, receiving either placebo or conjugated estrogens, with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate. Efficacy for vasomotor symptoms was assessed during the first 12 weeks of treatment in a subset of symptomatic women (n = 241) who had at least seven moderate to severe hot flushes daily, or at least 50 moderate to severe hot flushes during the week before randomization. Premarin (0.3 mg, 0.45 mg, and 0.625 mg tablets) was shown to be statistically better than placebo at weeks 4 and 12 for relief of both the frequency and severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.
Effects on vulvar and vaginal atrophy
Results of vaginal maturation indexes at cycles 6 and 13 showed that the differences from placebo were statistically significant (p < 0.001) for all treatment groups (conjugated estrogens alone and conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment groups).
Effects on bone mineral density
Data is from the double-blind, randomized, placebo/active-drug-controlled, multicenter HOPE study. The study enrolled healthy postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, who were 2.3 Â± 0.9 years on average since menopause and took one 600-mg tablet of elemental calcium (Caltrate) daily. The subjects were treated with Premarin 0.625 mg, 0.45 mg, 0.3 mg, or placebo. Prevention of bone loss was assessed by measurement of bone mineral density (BMD), primarily at the anteroposterior lumbar spine (L2 to L4). Secondarily, BMD measurements of the total body, femoral neck, and trochanter were also analyzed. All active treatment groups showed significant differences from placebo in each of the four BMD endpoints at cycles 6, 13, 19, and 26. The mean percent increases in the primary efficacy measure (L2 to L4 BMD) at the final on-therapy evaluation (cycle 26 for those who completed and the last available evaluation for those who discontinued early) were 2.46% with 0.625 mg, 2.26% with 0.45 mg, and 1.13% with 0.3 mg. The placebo group showed a mean percent decrease from baseline at the final evaluation of 2.45%. These results supported the efficacy of the lower doses.

The FDA approval of Lokelma was based on data from three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and two open-label trials, which showed that for patients receiving Lokelma the onset of action was at 1.0 hour and the median time to achieving normal potassium levels in the blood was 2.2 hours, with 92% of patients achieving normal potassium levels within 48 hours from baseline.The treatment effect was maintained for up to 12 months.
","Side Effects
The most common adverse reaction associated with the use of Lokelma is mild to moderate edema.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) is a highly-selective, oral potassium-removing agent. Lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) is a non-absorbed zirconium silicate that preferentially captures potassium in exchange for hydrogen and sodium. In vitro, Lokelma has a high affinity for potassium ions, even in the presence of other cations such as calcium and magnesium. Lokelma increases fecal potassium excretion through binding of potassium in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. Binding of potassium reduces the concentration of free potassium in the gastrointestinal lumen, thereby lowering serum potassium level.

Metabolic Disorders,Procysbi (cysteamine bitartrate),"General Information
Procysbi (cysteamine bitartrate) ) delayed-release capsules is a cystine depleting agent which lowers the cystine content of cells in patients with nephropathic cystinosis, an inherited defect of lysosomal transport.
Procysbi is specifically indicated for the management of nephropathic cystinosis in adults and children ages 6 years and older.
Procysbi is supplied as a delayed-release capsule and can be administered either orally or via a feeding tube. It should be taken at least 2 hours after and at least 30 min before eating. Starting Dose: Procysbi therapy should be initiated promptly once the diagnosis is confirmed. Cysteamine-naÃ¯ve patients should be started on 1/6 to 1/4 of the maintenance dose of Procysbi. The dose should be raised gradually over 4 to 6 weeks to help reduce the risk of side-effects. WBC cystine level and/or cysteamine concentration measurements, taken Â½ hour after dose administration, are recommended for new patients after the maintenance dose is achieved. Maintenance Dose: The recommended maintenance dose is 1.3 gram/m2/day, in two divided doses given every 12 hours. The dose can be increased up to 1.95 grams/m2/day if the white blood cell cystine level remains higher than the target WBC cystine level and/or the target cysteamine concentration has not been achieved.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Procysbi was based on the following trials. Trial 1 (RP103-01) was a single center, single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, 2-period, immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate vs. Pocysbi pilot study in 9 (8 pediatric and 1 adult) patients with nephropathic cystinosis ages 6 years to 24 years. The trial reported highly variable inter-patient bioavailability with both immediate-release cysteamine and Procysbi. The trial suggested that, when WBC cystine trough levels are used as a measurement of cellular cystine depletion, delayed-release cysteamine (Procysbi) administered every 12 hours (Q12H) is as effective as immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate administered every 6 hours (Q6H).
Trials 2, 5 and 6 (RP103-02, RP103-05, and RP103-06 respectively) were PK studies conducted in healthy volunteers. Trial 3 (RP103-03), the pivotal trial for Procysbi, was a phase III multicenter (US and EU) randomized, crossover, immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate vs. Procysbi trial in 43 (40 pediatric and 3 adult) patients with nephropathic cystinosis. Patient age ranged from 6 to 26 years. Prior to randomization, patients were to be on a stable dose of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate administered Q6H. Procysbi dose adjustments of up to ~100% of the total daily dose of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate were allowed by trial criteria. The average total daily dose of Procysbi for patients completing the clinical trial was ~91 % of the average total daily dose of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate for patients at trial entry. Trial 3 demonstrated that at steady-state Procysbi (cysteamine bitartrate) delayed-release capsules administered Q12H was non-inferior to immediate release cysteamine bitartrate administered Q6H with respect to the depletion of WBC cystine levels. Forty out of forty-one patients completing Trial 3 are continuing treatment with Procysbi in an ongoing, open-label extension trial, i.e. Trial 4 (RP103Â­ 04), for total treatment duration of 24 months. Twenty additional patients (14 pediatric patients, ages 1 to 6 years, and 6 (4 adult and 2 pediatric) renal transplant patients) have also been enrolled in Trial 4. An interim analysis was performed after all enrolled patients from Trial 3 had been treated with Pocysbi for at least 12 months (n=33) and up to 19 months (n=3). The analysis indicated that patients switched from immediate-release cysteamine to a treatment regimen of Procysbi maintained a WBC level < 1 nmol/Â½ cystine/mg protein for up to 19 months at a total daily dose equal to their total daily dose of immediate release cysteamine at entry in Trial 3. During extended treatment there has been on average no worsening of the kidney function, as expressed by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

Metabolic Disorders,Ravicti (glycerol phenylbutyrate),"General Information
Ravicti (glycerol phenylbutyrate) is a nitrogen-binding agent. Urea cycle disorders result from deficiencies in the enzymes responsible for clearing toxic ammonia from the blood. During protein metabolism, nitrogen is produced as a waste product, which is normally converted to urea and excreted. In patients with urea cycle disorders, the nitrogen accumulates as ammonia and can cause coma, brain damage, and death. Glycerol phenylbutyrate aids in the removal of this accumulated ammonia.
Ravicti is specifically indicated for use as a nitrogen-binding agent for chronic management of adult and pediatric patients over 2 years of age with urea cycle disorders who cannot be managed by dietary protein restriction and/or amino acid supplementation alone. Ravicti must be used with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, dietary supplements.
Ravicti is supplied as a liquid for oral administration. It should be taken with food and administered directly into the mouth via oral syringe or dosing cup. The recommended dosages for patients switching from sodium phenylbutyrate to Ravicti and patients naÃ¯ve to phenylbutyric acid are different. For both subpopulations:
Give Ravicti in three equally divided dosages, each rounded up to the nearest 0.5 mL.
The maximum total daily dosage is 17.5 mL (19 g).
Ravicti must be used with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, dietary supplements.
Please see the Ravicti drug label for specific instructions in dosing patients switching from sodium phenylbutyrate to Ravicti and patients naÃ¯ve to phenylbutyric acid.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ravicti was based on separate studies in adults and pediatrics.
Clinical Studies in Adults
A randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, crossover, non-inferiority study enrolled 45 subjects with UCDs who had been on sodium phenylbutyrate prior to enrollment. The trial was designed to compare Ravicti to sodium phenylbutyrate by evaluating venous ammonia levels. The primary endpoint was to establish non-inferiority in the 24-hour AUC (a measure of exposure to ammonia over 24 hours) for venous ammonia on days 14 and 28 when the drugs were expected to be at steady state. The subjects were randomized to Sodium phenylbutyrate for 2 weeks followed by Ravicti for 2 weeks or Ravicti for 2 weeks followed by Sodium phenylbutyrate for 2 weeks. The dose of Ravicti was calculated to deliver the same amount of PBA as the sodium phenylbutyrate dose the patients were taking when they entered the trial. Both treatments were administered three times daily with meals. Forty-four subjects were evaluable for analysis. Ravicti was noninferior to sodium phenylbutyrate with respect to the 24-hour AUC for ammonia. Mean 24-hour AUCs for venous ammonia during steady-state dosing were 866 Âµmol/L hour and 977 Âµmol/L hour with Ravicti and sodium phenylbutyrate, respectively.
Long-term (12-month), uncontrolled, open-label study
This study was conducted to assess monthly ammonia control and hyperammonemic crisis over a 12-month period. A total of 51 adults were in the study and all but 6 had been converted from sodium phenylbutyrate to Ravicti. Venous ammonia levels were monitored monthly. Mean fasting venous ammonia values in adults were within normal limits during long-term treatment with Ravicti (range: 6-30 Âµmol/L). Of 51 adult, 7 (14%) reported a total of 10 hyperammonemic crises.
Clinical Studies in Pediatrics
Two fixed-sequence, open-label, sodium phenylbutyrate to Ravicti switchover studies were conducted in pediatrics ages 2 to 17 years. The first study was 7 days in duration and the second study was 10 days in duration. A total of 26 subjects were enrolled. The dose of Ravicti was calculated to deliver the same amount of PBA as the dose of sodium phenylbutyrate patients were taking when they entered the trial. Sodium phenylbutyrate or Ravicti were administered in divided doses with meals and the subjects adhered to a low-protein diet throughout the study. After a dosing period with each treatment, all subjects underwent 24 hours of venous ammonia measurements, as well as blood and urine PK assessments. The 24-hour AUCs for blood ammonia (AUC0-24h) in 11 pediatrics 6 to 17 years of age (Study 1) and 11 pediatrics 2 years to 5 years of age (Study 2) were similar between treatments. In children 6 to 17 years of age, the ammonia AUC0-24h was 604 ÂµmolÂ·h/L vs. 815 ÂµmolÂ·h/L on Ravicti versus sodium phenylbutyrate. In the patients between 2 years and 5 years of age, the ammonia AUC0-24h was 632 ÂµmolÂ·h/L vs. 720 ÂµmolÂ·h/L on Ravicto versus sodium phenylbutyrate.
Long-term (12-month), uncontrolled, open-label studies
These studies were conducted to assess monthly ammonia control and hyperammonemic crisis over a 12-month period. In two studies, on of which also enrolled adults (see above), and an extension of Study 1 above, referred to here as Study 1E), a total of 26 children ages 6 to 17, were enrolled, and all but 1 had been converted from sodium phenylbutyrate to Ravicti. Mean fasting venous ammonia values were within normal limits during long-term treatment with Ravicti (range: 17-23 Âµmol/L). Of the 26 patients, 5 (19%) reported a total of 5 hyperammonemic crises. In an extension of Study 2, after a median time on study of 4.5 months (range 1.0-5.7 months), 2 of 16 pediatrics ages 2 to 5 years had experienced three hyperammonemic crises.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Ravicti may include, but are not limited to, the following:

",,"Mechanism of Action
Ravicti (glycerol phenylbutyrate) is a nitrogen-binding agent. UCDs are inherited deficiencies of enzymes or transporters necessary for the synthesis of urea from ammonia (NH3, NH4+). Absence of these enzymes or transporters results in the accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the blood and brain of affected patients. Ravicti is a triglyceride containing 3 molecules of phenylbutyrate (PBA). PAA, the major metabolite of PBA, is the active moiety of Ravicti. PAA conjugates with glutamine (which contains 2 molecules of nitrogen) via acetylation in the liver and kidneys to form PAGN, which is excreted by the kidneys (Figure 1). On a molar basis, PAGN, like urea, contains 2 moles of nitrogen and provides an alternate vehicle for waste nitrogen excretion.

Metabolic Disorders,Vimizim (elosulfase alfa),"General Information
Vimizim is a formulation of elosulfase alfa, which is a purified human enzyme produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. It is an enzyme replacement therapy, presumed to include a recombinant human form of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase.
Vimizin is specifically indicated for Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS IVA; Morquio A syndrome).
Vimizin is supplied as a solution for intravenous administration. The recommended dose is 2 mg per kg given intravenously over a minimum range of 3.5 to 4.5 hours, based on infusion volume, once every week. Pre-treatment with antihistamines with or without antipyretics is recommended 30 to 60 minutes prior to the start of the infusion.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Vimizin was based on a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 176 subjects with MPS IVA, ranging in age from 5 to 57 years. The majority of the subjects (82%) presented with a medical history of musculoskeletal conditions. At baseline, all enrolled subjects could walk more than 30 meters (m) but less than 325 m in six minutes. The subjects received Vimizin 2mg/kg every week, every other week or placebo. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the distance walked in six minutes (six minute walk test, 6-MWT) at Week 24. The treatment effect in the distance walked in 6 minutes, compared to placebo, was 22.5 m (CI95, 4.0, 40.9; p=0.0174) in subjects who received Vimizim 2 mg/kg once per week. There was no difference in the rate of stair climbing between treatment groups.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Vimizin may include, but are not limited to, the following:
pyrexia
vomiting
headache,
nausea
abdominal pain
chills
fatigue
",,"Mechanism of Action
Vimizim is a formulation of elosulfase alfa, which is a purified human enzyme produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Mucopolysaccharidoses comprise a group of lysosomal storage disorders caused by the deficiency of specific lysosomal enzymes required for the catabolism of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA, Morquio A Syndrome) is characterized by the absence or marked reduction in N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase activity. The sulfatase activity deficiency results in the accumulation of the GAG substrates, KS and C6S, in the lysosomal compartment of cells throughout the body. The accumulation leads to widespread cellular, tissue, and organ dysfunction. Vimizim is intended to provide the exogenous enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase that will be taken up into the lysosomes and increase the catabolism of the GAGs KS and C6S. Elosulfase alfa uptake by cells into lysosomes is mediated by the binding of mannose-6-phosphate-terminated oligosaccharide chains of elosulfase alfa to mannose-6-phosphate receptors.

Metastatic Cancer,Perjeta (pertuzumab),"General Information
Perjeta (pertuzumab) is a HER2/neu receptor antagonist compound. It has been shown to augment anti-tumor activity as a complement to Herceptin, as the two medicines target different regions on the HER2 receptor.
Perjeta is specifically indicated for the first-line treatment of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel.
Perjeta is supplied as a 420 mg/14 mL single-use vial for intravenous infusion. The recommended initial dose is 840 mg administered as a 60-minute intravenous infusion, followed every 3 weeks thereafter by 420 mg administered as a 30 to 60 minute intravenous infusion.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Perjeta was based on the results of a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 808 subjects with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo plus trastuzumab and docetaxel or Perjeta plus Herceptin (trastuzumab) and docetaxel. Randomization was stratified by prior treatment and geographic region. Perjeta was given intravenously at an initial dose of 840 mg, followed by 420 mg every three weeks thereafter. Herceptin was given intravenously at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg, followed by 6 mg/kg every three weeks thereafter. Subjects were treated with Perjeta and trastuzumab until progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. Docetaxel was given as an initial dose of 75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion every three weeks for at least six cycles. The docetaxel dose could be escalated to 100 mg/m2 at the investigatorâ€™s discretion if the initial dose was well tolerated. The study showed subjects who received Perjeta in combination with Herceptin and docetaxel chemotherapy experienced a 38% reduction in the risk of their disease worsening or death compared to those who received Herceptin and chemotherapy plus placebo (HR=0.62; p<0.0001). The study demonstrated a 6.1 month improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) in subjects treated with Perjeta compared to those who received Herceptin and chemotherapy plus placebo (median PFS 18.5 vs. 12.4 months).
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions associated with the use of Perjeta in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel may include, but are not limited to, the following:
diarrhea
alopecia
neutropenia
nausea
fatigue
rash
peripheral neuropathy
",,"Mechanism of Action
Pertuzumab targets the extracellular dimerization domain (Subdomain II) of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER2) and, thereby, blocks ligand-dependent heterodimerization of HER2 with other HER family members, including EGFR, HER3 and HER4. As a result, pertuzumab inhibits ligand-initiated intracellular signaling through two major signal pathways, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Inhibition of these signaling pathways can result in cell growth arrest and apoptosis, respectively. In addition, pertuzumab mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The drug's anti-tumor activity is significantly augmented when administered in combination with Herceptin.

Metastatic Melanoma,Erivedge (vismodegib),"General Information
Erivedge (vismodegib) is an inhibitor of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. The pathway promotes cellular development and division in several cell types, both through direct cellular activation and through secondary activation of multiple pathways of tissue generation, including angiogenesis and tissue growth. The pathway is typically over-activated in basal cell carcinoma.
Erivedge is specifically approved for the treatment of adults with metastatic basal cell carcinoma, or with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma that has recurred following surgery or who are not candidates for surgery, and who are not candidates for radiation.
Erivedge is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of Erivedge is 150 mg taken orally once daily until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity. If a dose of Erivedge is missed, do not make up that dose; resume dosing with the next scheduled dose.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Erivedge was based on an international, single-arm, multi-center, open-label, two-cohort trial. The trial enrolled 104 subjects with either metastatic basal cell carcinoma (mBCC) or locally advanced BCC (laBCC). The subjects received 150 mg vismodegib per day orally until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of treatment was 10.2 months. The major efficacy outcome measure of the trial was objective response rate (ORR). In the mBCC cohort, tumor response was assessed according to RECIST criteria. In the laBCC cohort, tumor response evaluation included measurement of externally assessable tumor (including scar) and assessment for ulceration in photographs, radiographic assessment of target lesions (if appropriate), and tumor biopsy. Of the 104 subjects enrolled, 96 were evaluable for ORR. In the mBCC cohort, 30.3% reported an ORR and in the laBCC cohort 42.9% reported an ORR. The median response duration in both arms was 7.6 months.

Aimovig is specifically indicated for the preventative treatment of migraine in adults.
Aimovig is supplied as an injection for subcutaneous use. The recommended dosage of Aimovig is 70 mg injected subcutaneously once monthly. Some patients may benefit from a dosage of 140mg injected subcutaneously once monthly, which is administered as two consecutive subcutaneous injections of 70mg each. If a dose of Aimovig is missed, administer as soon as possible. Thereafter, Aimovig can be scheduled monthly from the date of the last dose.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Aimovig as a preventive treatment of episodic or chronic migraine was based on three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: two studies in patients with episodic migraine (4 to 14 migraine days per month)(Study 1 and Study 2) and one study in patients with chronic migraine (â‰¥15 headache days per month with â‰¥8 migraine days per month) (Study 3). The studies enrolled patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura, according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-III) diagnostic criteria.
Study 1 was a randomized, multi-center, 6-month, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating Aimovig for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine. A total of 955 patients with a history of episodic migraine were randomized to receive either Aimovig 70 mg (N = 317), Aimovig 140 mg (N = 319), or placebo (N = 319) by subcutaneous injection once monthly (QM) for 6 months. Patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments including migraine-specific medications (i.e., triptans, ergotamine derivatives) and NSAIDs during the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days over months 4 to 6. Subjects in the erenumab 70 mg and 140 mg treatment arms experienced reductions of 3.2 and 3.7 days from baseline in monthly migraine days, respectively, as compared to a 1.8-day reduction in the placebo arm.
Study 2 was a randomized, multi-center, 3-month, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating Aimovig for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine. A total of 577 patients with a history of episodic migraine were randomized to receive either Aimovig 70 mg (N = 286) or placebo (N = 291) by subcutaneous injection once monthly for 3 months. Patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments including migraine-specific medications (i.e., triptans, ergotamine derivatives) and NSAIDs during the study.

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Emgality for migraine was based on two Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with episodic migraine (EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2) and one Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with chronic migraine (REGAIN).
EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2 were six-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that enrolled adult patients with episodic migraine (defined as 4-14 migraine headache days [MHDs] per month). REGAIN was a three-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled adult patients with chronic migraine (defined as at least 15 headache days per month with at least 8 MHDs per month). In all three studies, patients were randomized to receive once-monthly placebo, Emgality 120 mg after an initial loading dose of 240 mg, or Emgality 240 mg. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs over the double-blind treatment period in the intent-to-treat study population.
EVOLVE-1 (Over Months 1 to 6 - baseline migraine headache days: Emgality 9.2, placebo 9.1)

Reyvow is specifically indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.
Reyvow is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose of Reyvow is 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg taken orally, as needed. No more than one dose should be taken in 24 hours, and Reyvow should not be taken unless the patient can wait at least 8 hours between dosing and driving or operating machinery. A second dose of Reyvow has not been shown to be effective for the same migraine attack. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 migraine attacks in a 30-day period has not been established. Reyvow may be taken with or without food.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Reyvow was based on two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (SAMURAI and SPARTAN). A total of 3,177 adult patients with a history of migraine with and without aura treated a migraine attack with Reyvow. In both studies, the percentages of patients whose pain resolved and whose most bothersome migraine symptom (nausea, light sensitivity, or sound sensitivity) resolved two hours after treatment were significantly greater among patients receiving Reyvow at all doses compared to those receiving placebo. The percentage of responders is listed below:
SAMURAI: Reyvow 100 mg (28.3%); Reyvow 200 mg (31.8%) and placebo (15.3%)
SPARTAN: Reyvow 50 mg (28.3%); Reyvow 100 mg (31.4%); Reyvow 200 mg (38.8%) and placebo (21.0%)

Migraine (Adult),Tosymra (sumatriptan) nasal spray,"General Information
Tosymra is a nasal spray formulation of sumatriptan, a selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist.
Tosymra is specifically indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.
Tosymra is supplied as a spray for intranasal administration. The recommended dose is 10 mg given as a single spray in one nostril. The maximum cumulative dose that may be given in a 24-hour period is 30 mg, with doses separated by at least one hour. Tosymra may also be given at least one hour following a dose of another sumatriptan product.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The efficacy of Tosymra was based on the relative bioavailability of Tosymra nasal spray compared to sumatriptan subcutaneous injection (4 mg) in healthy adults. Following nasal administration of 10 mg of Tosymra in 73 healthy adults, the relative bioavailability of Tosymra was approximately 87% of that obtained following 4 mg subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan. The relative bioavailability of Tosymra was approximately 58% of that obtained following 6 mg subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan.
Tosymra was evaluated in a phase II multicenter, double-blind study conducted in 107 subjects with episodic migraine. The subjects were randomized to receive either Tosymra or placebo to treat a migraine attack with a moderate or severe pain level. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with migraine pain freedom at 2 hours postdose (2hPF). Data showed there was a significantly higher proportion of subjects who experienced 2hPF with Tosymra compared with placebo: 43.8% (n=48) versus 22.5% (n=40). Tosymra was also significantly better than placebo at alleviating the patients' most bothersome symptom (MBS), including nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia (70.7% versus 39.5% MBS free at 2 hours postdose).

",,"Mechanism of Action
Tosymra (sumatriptan) is a sulfonamide triptan with vasoconstrictor activity. Sumatriptan selectively binds to and activates serotonin 5-HT1D receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), thereby constricting cerebral blood vessels. This may lead to a relief in pain from vascular headaches. Sumatriptan may also relieve vascular headaches by decreasing the release of vasoactive neuropeptides from perivascular trigeminal axons in the dura mater during a migraine, by reducing extravasation of plasma proteins, and by decreasing the release of other mediators of inflammation from the trigeminal nerve.

Migraine and Cluster Headaches,Axert (almotriptan malate) tablets,"General Information
Axert has been approved by the FDA for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Axert belongs to a class of drugs known as selective serotonin receptor agonists. These drugs target serotonin receptors and act against migraine headaches by inducing the constriction of blood vessels surrounding the brain.
Migraine attacks are characterized by severe unilateral head pain, which lasts between four and 72 hours. Attacks are often are accompanied by nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light and/or sound. Approximately 28 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches, with women experiencing migraines at least three times more often than men. For many sufferers, these headaches have a significant impact on their quality of life.
Pharmacia plans to market Axert in the United States under a licensing agreement with Almirall Prodesfarma, SA, Spain. The drug is also approved in the European Union.
Clinical Results
Results of controlled clinical trials demonstrated that Axert was highly effective and well tolerated. Data showed that Axert (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg) produced significant relief from migraine headache pain at two hours, with efficacy rates ranging from 57% to 65% (12.5 mg) and 55% to 56% (6.25 mg) compared to placebo.
","Side Effects
Side effects associated with the use of Axert include (but are not limited to) the following:
Nausea
Sleepiness
Paresthesia (tingling or numbness)
Dry mouth
Headache
In controlled trials, Axert showed a low percentage of side effects characteristic of triptans. However, this class of compounds has the potential to cause coronary vasospasm, and as a result Axert is not advised for patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Axert Tablets contain almotriptan malate, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D (5-HT 1B/1D) receptor agonist. Almotriptan binds with high affinity to 5-HT 1D, 5-HT 1B and 5-HT 1F receptors. Almotriptan has weak affinity for 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 7 receptors, but has no significant affinity or pharmacological activity at 5-HT 2, 5-HT 3, 5-HT 4, 5-HT 6; alpha or beta adrenergic; adenosine (A1, A2); angiotensin (AT 1, AT 2); dopamine (D1, D2); endothelin (ET A, ET B); or tachykinin (NK 1, NK 2, NK 3) binding sites.
Current theories on the etiology of migraine headache suggest that symptoms are due to local cranial vasodilation and/or to the release of vasoactive and pro-inflammatory peptides from sensory nerve endings in an activated trigeminal system. The therapeutic activity of almotriptan in migraine can most likely be attributed to agonist effects at 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on the extracerebral, intracranial blood vessels that become dilated during a migraine attack, and on nerve terminals in the trigeminal system. Activation of these receptors results in cranial vessel constriction, inhibition of neuropeptide release and reduced transmission in trigeminal pain pathways. (from Axert Prescribing Information)

","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Asprin may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Nausea
Fever
Ringing in the ears
Drowsiness
Headache
",,"Mechanism of Action
Asprin contains the active ingredient acetylsalicylic acid, which acts in a pain relieving, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic and anti-thrombotic manner. Acetylsalicylic acid also works to alleviate the increased aggreagation of blood platelets and the release of serotonin that are characteristic of migraine attacks.
"
Migraine and Cluster Headaches,Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA),"General Information
Botox blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to acceptor sites on motor or sympathetic nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter at somatic neuromuscular junctions, the parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic preganglionic fibers (cholinergic fibers), and at some synapses in the central nervous system.
Botox for injection is specifically indicated for the prophylaxis of headaches in adult patients with chronic migraine (more than 15 days per month with headache lasting 4 hours a day or longer).
Botox is supplied as a solution for intramuscular injection. The recommended initial dose is 155 Units administered intramuscularly (IM) using a sterile 30-gauge, 0.5 inch needle as 0.1 mL (5 Units) injections per each site. Injections should be divided across 7 specific head/neck muscle areas: Frontalis, Corrugator, Procerus, Occipitalis, Temporalis, Trapezius, Cervical Paraspinal Muscle Group. With the exception of the procerus muscle, which should be injected at 1 site (midline), all muscles should be injected bilaterally with half the number of injection sites administered to the left, and half to the right side of the head and neck. The recommended retreatment schedule is every 12 weeks.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Botox for chronic migraine was based on two randomized, multi-center, 24-week, 2 injection cycle, placebo-controlled double-blind studies. Both studies included chronic migraine adults who were not using any concurrent headache prophylaxis, and during a 28-day baseline period had at least 15 headache days lasting 4 hours or more, with at least 50% of these being migraine/probable migraine. In both studies, patients were randomized to receive placebo or 155 Units to 195 Units Botox injections every 12 weeks for the 2-cycle, double-blind phase. At 28 days, the efficacy data are as follows:
Study One
Change from baseline in frequency of headache days: -7.8 for Botox vs. -6.4 for placebo (pâ‰¤0.05).
Change from baseline in total cumulative hours of headache on headache days: -107 for Botox vs. -70 for placebo (pâ‰¤0.05).
Study Two
Change from baseline in frequency of headache days: -9.2 for Botox vs. -6.9 for placebo (pâ‰¤0.05).
Change from baseline in total cumulative hours of headache on headache days: -134 for Botox vs. -95 for placebo (pâ‰¤0.05).
The subjects treated with Botox had a significantly greater mean decrease from baseline in the frequency of headache days at most timepoints from Week 4 to Week 24 in Study 1 and all timepoints from Week 4 to Week 24 in Study 2 compared to placebo-treated patients.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Botox for migraine may include, but are not limited to, the following:
neck pain
headache
worsening migraine
muscular weakness
eyelid ptosis
",,"Mechanism of Action
Botox blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to acceptor sites on motor or sympathetic nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. This inhibition occurs as the neurotoxin cleaves SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within nerve endings.

Migraine and Cluster Headaches,Cambia (diclofenac potassium for oral solution),"General Information
Cambia (diclofenac potassium) is a benzeneacetic acid derivative non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The mechanism of action of Cambia, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.
Cambia is specifically indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults (18 years of age or older).
Cambia is supplied as a powder designed to give 50mg of solution when mixed with water, for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is one packet (50mg) mixed with 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 mL) of water. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest treatment duration.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Cambia for migraines was based on the results of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The subjects were instructed to treat a migraine of moderate to severe pain with 1 dose of study medication; they evaluated their headache pain 2 hours later. Associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also evaluated. The proportion of subjects who were ""sustained pain free"", defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to no pain at 2 hours post-dose without a return of mild, moderate, or severe pain and no use of rescue medication for 24 hours post-dose, was also evaluated. The percentage of subjects achieving pain freedom 2 hours after treatment and sustained pain freedom from 2 to 24 hours post-dose, as well as the percentage of subjects achieving pain relief 2 hours after treatment, was significantly greater in the Cambia arm compared with the placebo arm.

Migraine and Cluster Headaches,Depakote (divalproex sodium),"General Information
Depakote tablets have been approved for the prevention of migraine headaches.
Clinical Results
The results of two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials established the efficacy of Depakote in reducing the incidence of migraine headaches. Both studies consisted of a four-week initial phase, during which subjects were monitored to determine migraine headache frequency, and a 12-week treatment phase. Slightly less than half of Depakote-treated subjects showed reduction in migraine frequency.
","Side Effects
Depakote was generally well tolerated in the two clinical trials. Most frequent adverse events reported by patients receiving Depakote were nausea, dyspepsia, diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, fatigue, sleepiness, and dizziness. Events leading to discontinuation included hair loss, nausea, vomiting, weight gain, and tremor.
Other safety considerations include hepatic failure, which has resulted in fatalities in subjects receiving valproic acid and its derivatives, usually in the first six months of treatment. Valproic acid can produce teratogenic effects in the offspring of women receiving the drug during pregnancy. Divalproex sodium is a derivative of valproic acid. The use of Depakote tablets for migraine prophylaxis in women of childbearing potential requires that the benefits of its use be weighed against the risk of injury to the fetus.

Migraine and Cluster Headaches,Depakote ER (divalproex sodium),"General Information
Depakote ER is an extended-release product used to prevent or reduce the occurrence of migraines. It is indicated for the prevention of migraine headaches in adults; however, there is no evidence that it is useful in the acute treatment of migraine headaches. Depakote ER is provided in tablet form.
About 23 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches, and approximately 75% of migraine sufferers are women. Migraines may also include nausea and/or vomiting, as well as sensitivity to light and sound.
Clinical Results
The results of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial demonstrated the effectiveness of Depakote ER in the prevention of migraine headaches. Patients who experienced two migraine headaches in a four-week baseline period were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Depakote ER or placebo and treated for 12 weeks. Patients began treatment on 500 mg once daily for one week, and were then increased to 1000 mg once daily with an option to decrease the dose back to 500 mg during the second week if intolerance occurred. 98 of 114 Depakote ER-treated patients (86%) and 100 of 110 placebo-treated patients (91%) treated at least two weeks maintained the 1000 mg once daily dose for the duration of their treatment. Treatment outcome was based on the reduction of the four-week migraine headache rate in the treatment period compared to the baseline period.
Two hundred and two patients (101 in each treatment group) completed the treatment period. The mean reduction in the four-week migraine headache rate was 1.2 from a baseline mean of 4.4 in the Depakote ER group, versus 0.6 from a baseline mean of 4.2 in the placebo group. The treatment difference was statistically significant. (from FDA Label)
","Side Effects
Adverse effects reported with Depakote ER use include (but are not limited to) the following:
Nausea
Diarrhea
Vomiting
Abdominal pain
Dizziness
Tremor
Weight gain
Back pain
Depakote ER generally should not be administered to patients with hepatic (liver) disease or significant hepatic dysfunction.
Before using Depakote ER, a woman who can become pregnant should consider the fact that Depakote ER has been associated with birth defects, in particular, with spina bifida and other defects related to failure of the spinal canal to close normally.

Migraine and Cluster Headaches,Frova (frovatriptan succinate),"General Information
The FDA has approved Frova (frovatriptan succinate) for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults. Frovatriptan, the active ingredient in Frova, works by binding to and stimulating serotonin (5-HT) receptors. Some scientists believe that migraines are caused by a constriction and sudden dilation of the blood vessels in the head, neck or scalp. Frova is believed to inhibit excessive dilation of the arteries associated with migraine attacks.
Frova offers a unique benefit in terms of its improved half-life. Migraine attacks generally last four to seventy-two hours. In contrast to currently marketed triptans, which have a half-life of six hours or less, Frova 2.5 mg tablets have a 26-hour half-life.
Clinical Results
Five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, outpatient trials demonstrated the effectiveness of Frova in treating migraine headaches. Two of the trials were dose finding, in which subjects received doses of Frova from 0.5 to 40 mg, while the remaining three evaluated only one dose (2.5 mg).
In these controlled short-term trials, subjects were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed for up to 24 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia were also evaluated. In two of the trials, a second dose of Frova was provided after the initial treatment to counter a recurrence of the headache within 24 hours.
In all five of the trials, the percentage of subjects achieving a headache response two hours after treatment was significantly greater for the Frova-treated group compared to placebo-treated subjects. The data showed that lower doses of Frova (1 mg or 0.5 mg) were not effective, and higher doses (5 mg to 40 mg) caused a greater incidence of adverse events without being more effective than a 2.5 mg dose. Additionally, in subjects with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia and phonophobia at baseline, those treated with Frova experienced a decreased incidence of these symptoms compared to subjects receiving placebo.
","Side Effects
Side effects associated with Frova include the following:
Dizziness
Fatigue
Tingling
Dry mouth
Hot flashes
Feeling hot or cold
Chest pain
Indigestion
Skeletal pain
Patients with the following conditions should not use Frova:
Uncontrolled high blood pressure
Heart disease
Hemiplegic or basilar migraine
History of stroke
Circulation problems
",,"Mechanism of Action
Frovatriptan is a 5-HT receptor agonist that binds with high affinity to 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. Frovatriptan has no significant effects on GABA mediated channel activity and has no significant affinity for benzodiazepine binding sites. Frovatriptan is believed to inhibit excessive dilation of extracerebral intracranial arteries in migraine. In anesthetized dogs and cats, intravenous administration of frovatriptan produced selective constriction of the carotid vascular bed and had no effect on blood pressure or coronary resistance.

Migraine and Cluster Headaches,Zomig (zolmitriptan),"General Information
Zomig-ZMT is an orally disintegrating tablet that has been approved for treatment of acute migraines in adults. The tablet has a pleasant orange flavor and dissolves quickly on the tongue. This easy delivery method makes the product convenient to take at anytime, anywhere.
Zomig-ZMT has a novel, dual-action pharmacological profile that has demonstrated both peripheral and central activity in the brain, working together to provide rapid, long-lasting relief of migraine pain.
Migraine is a common disorder worldwide and estimates suggest that 10 to 15 percent of the population in developed countries are affected at some time during their lives. The prevalence of migraine reaches a peak during sufferers' most productive years, between the ages of 25 and 55. The condition often causes disability and adversely affects quality of life.
Clinical Results
The effectiveness of Zomig-ZMT (zolmitriptan) as a treatment for acute migraine was established in five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The first was conducted in a clinical setting, while the other four were outpatient studies. Adult subjects received Zomig-ZMT in dosages of 1 mg, 2.5mg, or 5mg. They were instructed to administer the drug when suffering from moderate to severe migraine pain.
Subjects were assessed one, two, and four hours after dosing. Response was defined as reduction in severity of headache pain from moderate or severe, to mild or no pain. In all studies, subjects who received the two higher doses of Zomig-ZMT achieved a significantly greater response compared to those receiving the lowest dosage or placebo. Of the two studies evaluating the 1 mg dosage, only one reported subjects in the drug group achieving a significantly greater response than those in the placebo group. (from Zomig-ZMT Prescribing Information)
Trials demonstrated efficacy of Zomig-ZMT to be significant within one hour of dosing, with some patients experiencing relief within 30 minutes. One tablet provided relief up to 24 hours in the majority of subjects.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of zolmitriptan may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Chest pain
Tightness in throat
Feelings of tingling, heat, or pressure
",,"Mechanism of Action
Zomig-ZMT (zolmitriptan) is an oral selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor agonist that binds to human recombinant 5-HT and 5-HT receptors. It is thought that migraine symptoms are due to local cranial vasodilatation and/or to the release of sensory neuropeptides through nerve endings in the trigeminal system. The therapeutic effects of zolmitriptan are most likely due to the agonistic effects at the 5-HT recptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.
After zolmitriptan is absorbed through oral administration, its peak plasma concentrations occur in two hours. (from Zomig-ZMT Prescribing Information)

Migraine and Cluster Headaches,Zomig (zolmitriptan),"General Information
ZOMIG 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg tablets, an oral medication for the treatment of acute migraine with or without aura in adults, has been approved by the FDA.
Clinical Results
In the ZOMIG clinical program which included eight placebo and non-placebo controlled clinical trials, and a one year open label safety study enrolling more than 4,700 patients, the safety and efficacy of ZOMIG was assessed. In the five placebo-controlled trials, results showed that ZOMIG provided headache relief two hours after treatment significantly more often than placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse events reported by patients were mostly mild or of moderate intensity and the most common included asthenia (lack of energy), nausea, dizziness, somnolence (drowsiness), and paresthesia (feelings such as tingling, numbness, or itching).",,
Mood Disorders,Zoloft (sertraline HCl),"General Information
Zoloft has been approved for the treatment of Premenstrual Dysphoric Mood Disorder (PMDD). It can be taken either daily or for the two weeks before a woman's period. Zoloft is also indicated for the treatment of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PMDD exhibits symptoms similar to those seen with major depressive disorder and other mood disorders, but is distinguishable from such disorders by its cyclical nature. The intense physical and emotion symptoms associated with PMDD are present only between ovulation and menstruation. It is estimated that three to five percent of American women suffer from PMDD.
Clinical Results
The approval of Zoloft for the treatment of PMDD is supported by two placebo-controlled trials involving 532 women diagnosed with the disorder. Zoloft was significantly more effective in improving emotional and behavioral symptoms of PMDD than placebo, regardless if the drug was taken continously or only during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle. These symptoms included feelings of being depressed, hopeless or overwhelmed, and being angry or irritable and having conflicts with others. Those who were admistered Zoloft every day also noted improvement in physical symptoms including breast tenderness, bloating and headache.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Zoloft may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Upset stomach
Trouble sleeping
Diarrhea
Abdominal pain
Dry mouth
Sexual dysfunction
",,"Mechanism of Action
Zoloft (sertraline HCl) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Zoloft helps correct the chemical imbalance of serotonin in the brain. The effectiveness of Zoloft is presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin (5HT). Serotonin is a naturally occurring chemical in the brain that is involved in the transmission of messages between nerve cells.

",,"Mechanism of Action
CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein (48 kDa) expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells, including multiple myeloma and other cell types and tissues and has multiple functions, such as receptor mediated adhesion, signaling, and modulation of cyclase and hydrolase activity. Daratumumab is an IgG1Îº human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to CD38 and inhibits the growth of CD38 expressing tumor cells by inducing apoptosis directly through Fc mediated cross linking as well as by immune-mediated tumor cell lysis through complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and a subset of regulatory T cells (CD38+Tregs) express CD38 and are susceptible to daratumumab mediated cell lysis.

Empliciti (elotuzumab) is a SLAMF7-directed immunostimulatory antibody.
Empliciti is specifically indicated for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior therapies.
Empliciti is supplied as a solution for intravenous administration. The recommended dose is 10 mg/kg administered intravenously every week for the first two cycles and every 2 weeks thereafter in conjunction with the recommended dosing of lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone. Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Empliciti was based on ELOQUENT-2, a randomized, open-label study. Subjects received either Empliciti in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (ERd) or lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone. Treatment was administered in 4-week cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Empliciti 10 mg/kg was administered intravenously each week for the first 2 cycles and every 2 weeks thereafter. Prior to Empliciti infusion, dexamethasone was administered as a divided dose: an oral dose of 28 mg and an intravenous dose of 8 mg. In the control group and on weeks without Empliciti, dexamethasone 40 mg was administered as a single oral dose weekly. Lenalidomide 25 mg was taken orally once daily for the first 3 weeks of each cycle. Assessment of tumor response was conducted every 4 weeks. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR). With a minimum of two years follow-up, ERd delivered a benefit in PFS that was maintained over time, with PFS rates of 68% versus 57% at one year and 41% versus 27% at two years in the ERd and Rd arms, respectively. The ERd regimen also demonstrated a significant improvement in ORR, achieving an ORR of 78.5% versus 65.5% in the Rd arm.

Multiple Myeloma,Farydak (panobinostat),"General Information
Farydak (panobinostat) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor.
Farydak is specifically indicated for use in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 2 prior regimens, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on progression free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
Farydak is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended dose is 20 mg, taken orally once every other day for three doses per week (on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12) of Weeks 1 and 2 of each 21-day cycle for 8 cycles.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Farydak was based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who had received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy. A total of 768 subjects received bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 injected intravenously) with dexamethasone (20 mg) in addition to Farydak 20 mg (or placebo), taken orally every other day, for 3 doses per week in Weeks 1 and 2 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment was administered for a maximum of 16 cycles (48 weeks). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), using modified European Bone Marrow Transplant Group (EBMT) criteria, as assessed by the investigators. In the overall trial population, the median PFS was 12 months in the Farydak, bortezomib, dexamethasone arm and 8.1 months in the placebo, bortezomib, dexamethasone arm. At the time of interim analysis, overall survival was not statistically different between arms. The approval of Farydak was based upon the efficacy and safety in a prespecified subgroup analysis of 193 patients who had received prior treatment with both bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent and a median of 2 prior therapies as the benefit:risk appeared to be greater in this more heavily pretreated population than in the overall trial population. Of these 193 patients, 76% of them had received â‰¥2 prior lines of therapy. The median PFS was 10.6 months in the Farydak, bortezomib, and dexamethasone arm and 5.8 months in the placebo, bortezomib, and dexamethasone arm.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Farydak may include, but are not limited to, the following:
diarrhea
fatigue
nausea
peripheral edema
decreased appetite
pyrexia
vomiting
Fardak comes with a black box labeled warning. Severe diarrhea occurred in 25% of Farydak treated patients. Monitor for symptoms, institute anti-diarrheal treatment, interrupt Farydak and then reduce dose or discontinue Farydak. Severe and fatal cardiac ischemic events, severe arrhythmias, and ECG changes have occurred in patients receiving Farydak. Arrhythmias may be exacerbated by electrolyte abnormalities. Obtain ECG and electrolytes at baseline and periodically during treatment as clinically indicated.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Farydak (panobinostat) is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that inhibits the enzymatic activity of HDACs at nanomolar concentrations. HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of histones and some non-histone proteins. Inhibition of HDAC activity results in increased acetylation of histone proteins, an epigenetic alteration that results in a relaxing of chromatin, leading to transcriptional activation. In vitro, panobinostat caused the accumulation of acetylated histones and other proteins, inducing cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis of some transformed cells. Increased levels of acetylated histones were observed in xenografts from mice that were treated with panobinostat. Panobinostat shows more cytotoxicity towards tumor cells compared to normal cells.

Kyprolis (carfilzomib) is a proteasome inhibitor. Carfilzomib had antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities in vitro in solid and hematologic tumor cells. In animals, carfilzomib inhibited proteasome activity in blood and tissue and delayed tumor growth.
Kyprolis is specifically indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma in patients who have received at least two prior therapies including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy.
Kyprolis is supplied as a solution for intravenous administration. Kyprolis should be administered intravenously over 2 to 10 minutes, on two consecutive days, each week for three weeks followed by a 12-day rest period. Each 28-day period is considered one treatment cycle. In Cycle 1, Kyprolis should be administered at a dose of 20 mg/m2. If tolerated in Cycle 1, the dose should be escalated to 27 mg/m2 beginning in Cycle 2 and continued at 27 mg/m2 in subsequent cycles. Treatment may be continued until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity occurs.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Kyprolis was based on a single-arm, multicenter clinical trial. The trial enrolled 266 subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma who had received at least two prior therapies (including bortezomib and thalidomide and/or lenalidomide). Subjects were enrolled in the trial whose disease had a less than or equal to 25% response to the most recent therapy or had disease progression during or within 60 days of the most recent therapy. Kyprolis was administered intravenously over 2 to 10 minutes on two consecutive days each week for three weeks, followed by a 12-day rest period (28-day treatment cycle), until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for a maximum of 12 cycles. Subjects received 20 mg/m2 at each dose in Cycle 1, and 27 mg/m2 in subsequent cycles. To reduce the incidence and severity of fever, rigors, chills, dyspnea, myalgia, and arthralgia, dexamethasone 4 mg by mouth or by intravenous infusion was administered prior to all Kyprolis doses during the first cycle and prior to all Kyprolis doses during the first dose-escalation (27 mg/m2) cycle. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR) as determined using International Myeloma Working Group criteria. The ORR (stringent complete response [sCR] + complete response [CR] + very good partial response [VGPR] + partial response [PR]) was 22.9% (N = 266). The median duration of response was 7.8 months.

Xpovio is supplied as a tablet or oral administration. The recommended starting dosage of Xpovio is 80 mg (four 20 mg tablets) taken orally on Days 1 and 3 of each week until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The recommended starting dosage of dexamethasone is 20 mg taken orally with each dosage of Xpovio on Days 1 and 3 of each week. For additional information regarding the administration of dexamethasone, refer to its prescribing information. Each Xpovio dosage should be taken at approximately the same time of day, and each tablet should be swallowed whole with water. Do not break, chew, crush, or divide the tablets. If a dosage of Xpovio is missed or delayed, instruct patients to take their next dosage at the next regularly scheduled time. If a patient vomits a dosage of Xpovio, the patient should not repeat the dosage and the patient should take the next dosage on the next regularly scheduled day.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Xpovio for adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma was given under accelerated approval status based on response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.
The accelerated approval was based on results from the Phase 2b STORM (Selinexor Treatment of Refractory Myeloma) trial, which was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label study of patients with RRMM. STORM Part 2 included 122 patients with RRMM. In STORM Part 2, a total of 122 patients were treated with Xpovio (80 mg) in combination with dexamethasone (20 mg) on Days 1 and 3 of every week. Treatment continued until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR), as assessed by an Independent Review Committee based on the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma. The approval of Xpovio was based upon the efficacy and safety in a prespecified subgroup analysis of the 83 patients whose disease was refractory to bortezomib, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and daratumumab, as the benefit-risk ratio appeared to be greater in this more heavily pretreated population than in the overall trial population. For the STORM Part 2 studyâ€™s major efficacy outcome measure, the ORR was 25.3% in the subgroup of 83 patients, which included one stringent complete response, no complete responses, four very good partial responses and 16 partial responses. The median time to first response for these patients was 4 weeks and the median duration of response was 3.8 months.

Xpovio (selinexor) is a nuclear export inhibitor. In nonclinical studies, selinexor reversibly inhibits nuclear export of tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs), growth regulators, and mRNAs of oncogenic proteins by blocking exportin 1 (XPO1). XPO1 inhibition by selinexor leads to accumulation of TSPs in the nucleus, reductions in several oncoproteins, such as c-myc and cyclin D1, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis of cancer cells. Selinexor demonstrated pro-apoptotic activity in vitro in multiple myeloma cell lines and patient tumor samples, and in murine xenograft models.

Multiple Sclerosis,Aubagio (teriflunomide),"General Information
Aubagio (teriflunomide) is an immunomodulatory agent with anti-inflammatory properties. The exact mechanism by which teriflunomide exerts its therapeutic effect in multiple sclerosis is unknown but may involve a reduction in the number of activated lymphocytes in CNS.
Aubagio is specifically indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.
Aubagio is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is 7 mg or 14 mg orally once daily, taken with or without food.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Aubagio was based on two studies.
Study One
This double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 1,088 subjects with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). The subjects received once daily doses of teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg or placebo over 108 weeks. The primary endpoint was the annualized relapse rate (ARR). The ARR was significantly reduced in both Aubagio dose groups compared to placebo: Aubagio 14mg: 0.369 (p = 0.0005); Aubagio 7mg: 0.370 (p = 0.0002); placebo: 0.539; the Relative risk reduction was 31% for both Aubagio arms. The percentage of subjects remaining relapse-free at week 108 was 56.5% in the 14mg arm, 53.7% in the 7mg arm and 45.6% in the placebo arm. The percent disability progression at week 108 was 20.2% and 21.7% in the Aubagio 14mg and 7mg arms, respectively, versus 27.3% in the placebo arm. The time to disability progression sustained for 12 weeks was statistically significantly reduced only in the Aubagio 14 mg group compared to placebo. In addition, the change in total lesion volume from baseline was significantly lower in both the Aubagio arms than in the placebo arm and both Aubagio groups had significantly fewer gadolinium-enhancing lesions per T1-weighted scan than the placebo group.
Study Two
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 179 MS subjects with relapse. The subjects were treated with twice the usual dose of Aubagio for the first week and then received 7 mg or 14 mg of Aubagio or placebo for the remainder of the 36-week treatment period. The primary endpoint was the average number of unique active lesions/MRI scan during treatment. MRI was performed at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 18 weeks, 24 weeks, 30 weeks and 36 weeks. Baseline demographics were consistent across treatment groups. The mean number of unique active lesions per brain MRI scan during the 36-week treatment period was lower in subjects treated with Aubagio 14 mg (0.98) and 7 mg (1.06) as compared to placebo (2.69), the difference being statistically significant for both (p=0.0052 and p=0.0234, respectively).

Multiple Sclerosis,Avonex (Interferon Beta 1-A),"General Information
Avonex is used for treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. It is the first drug to have proven, in a blinded clinical trial, that it slows the progression of disability as well as reduces the frequency of exacerbations.
Clinical Results
In a phase III clinical trial, 40% fewer subjects on Avonex progressed one or more units on the Expanded Disability Status Scale than patients on placebo. The EDSS is the standard measure of disease progression in multiple sclerosis. In addition, subjects receiving Avonex in the trial experienced 32% fewer exacerbations of the disease than subjects on placebo. Furthermore, MRI studies showed a statistically significant reduction in the number and volume of active lesions in treated patients compared to placebo patients.
","Side Effects
The side effects observed in the trial were modest and largely involved flu-like symptoms characteristic of all interferon drugs. There were minimal injection-site reactions.",,

Multiple Sclerosis,Extavia (Interferon beta-l b),"General Information
Extavia (interferon Beta-1b) belongs to a family of naturally occurring proteins, produced by eukarotic cells in response to viral infection and other biologic agents. The exact mechanism of action through which Extavia works in multiple sclerosis is unknown. However, the beneficial effects are thought to be due to its modulation of the immune system to reduce inflammatory damage. Specifically, interferon beta limits the activation of immune cells that attack myelin, suppresses the production of inflammatory cytokines - a type of protein that amplifies the inflammatory response causing damage to myelin - and stimulates the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.
Extavia is specifically indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis to reduce the frequency of clinical exacerbations and in patients who have experienced a first clinical episode of MS.
Extavia is supplied as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution into a solution designed for subcutaneous administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 0.25 mg injected subcutaneously ever other day. Generally patients should be started at 0.0625 mg (0.25 mL) subcutaneously ever other day, and increased over a six week period to 0.25 mg (1 mL) every other day.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Extavia was based on four randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.
Study One
This trial enrolled 372 subjects, aged 18 to 50 years, who received either placebo, 0.05 mg of Intereron beta-l b or 0.25 mg of Interferon beta1b, self-administered subcutaneously every other day. The primary protocol-defined outcome measures were 1) frequency of exacerbations per patient and 2) proportion of exacerbation-free patients at two years. The annual exacerbation rates were as follows: placebo: 1.31, Extavia (0.05mg): 1.14 (p-value 0.005 vs. placebo) and Extavia (0.25mg): 0.90 (p-value 0.0001vs. placebo). The proportion of exacerbation- free patients was as follows: placebo: 16%, Extavia (0.05mg): 18% (p-value 0.609), Extavia (0.25mg): 25% (p-value 0.001 vs. placebo). The median percent change in MRI area for the 025 mg group was - 1.1 %, which was significantly smaller than the 16.5% observed for the placebo group (p=0.0001). In an evaluation of frequent MRI scans (every six weeks) on 52 patients at one site, the percent of scans with new or expanding lesions was 29% in the placebo group and 6% in the 0.25 mg treatment group (p=0.006).
Study Two and Three
These trials were designed to assess the effect of Interferon beta- 1b in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Study 2 was conducted in Europe and Study 3 was conducted in North America. Both studies enrolled patients who had evidence of disability progression (both Study 2 and 3) or two relapses (Study 2 only) within the previous two years. Patients in Study 2 were randomized to receive Interferon beta-lb 0.25mg or placebo while patients in Study 3 were randomized to receive Interferon beta- Ib (0.25 mg), Interferon beta1b (0.16mg/m2 body surface area- mean assigned dose 0.30 mg) or placebo. All agents were administered subcutaneously over 2 years. The primary outcome measure was progression of disability, defined as a 1.0 point increase in the EDSS score, or a 0.5 point increase for patients with baseline EDSS >6.0. In Study 2, time to progression in EDSS was longer in the Interferon beta- 1b treatment group (p=0.005), with estimated annualized rates of progression of 16% and 19% in the Interferon beta-Ib and placebo groups, respectively. In Study 3, the rates of progression did not differ significantly between treatment groups, with estimated annualized rates of progression of 12%, 14%, and 12% in the Interferon beta-Ib fixed dose, surface area-adjusted dose, and placebo groups, respectively. In Study 2, the mean annual relapse rates were 0.42 and 0.63 in the Interferon beta- Ib and placebo groups, respectively (p-<0.001). In Study 3, the mean annual relapse rates were 0.16, 0.20, and 0.28, for the fixed dose, surface area-adjusted dose, and placebo groups, respectively (p-<0.02). MRI endpoints in both Study 2 and Study 3 showed lesser increases in T2 MRI lesion area and decreased number of active MRI lesions in patients in the Interferon beta- 1b groups.
Study Four
Thus trial enrolled 468 patients who had recently (within 60 days) experienced an isolated demyelinating event, and who had lesions typical of multiple sclerosis on brain MRI. The subjects were randomized to receive either 0.25 mg Interferon beta- Ib or placebo subcutaneously ever other day. The primary outcome measure was time to development of a second exacerbation with involvement of at least two distinct anatomical regions. Secondary outcomes were brain MRI measures, including the cumulative number of newly active lesions, and the absolute change in T2 lesion volume. Patients were followed for up to two years or until they fulfilled the primary endpoint. Time to development of a second exacerbation was significantly delayed in patients treated with Interferon beta- 1b compared to placebo (p-<O .000 I). The Interferon beta-Ib Kaplan-Meier estimates of the percentage of patients developing an exacerbation within 24 months were 45% in the placebo group and 28% in the Interferon-beta1b group. The risk for developing a second exacerbation in the Interferon beta-Ib group was 53% of the risk of the placebo group. A significant difference in the absolute change in T2 lesion volume was not significantly different between the two arms.

Multiple Sclerosis,Gilenya (fingolimod),"General Information
Gilenya is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. The exact mechanism is unknown, but Gilenya is thought to work by reducing the immune system's attack on the central nervous system by retaining certain white blood cells (lymphocytes) in the lymph nodes.
Gilenya is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis to reduce the frequency of clinical exacerbations and to delay the accumulation of physical disability.
Gilenya is supplied as a capsule designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is 0.5 mg orally once daily, with or without food.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Gilenya was based on two clinical studies.
Study One
This 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 1,272 patients with RRMS who had not received any interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate for at least the previous 3 months and had not received any natalizumab for at least the previous 6 months. The subjects received Gilenya 0.25mg, 1.25mg or placebo for up to 24 months. The primary endpoint was the annual relapse rate. The 1.25 mg dose resulted in no additional benefit over the 0.5 mg dose. Results are as follows: Annualized relapse rate 0.18 for Gilenya 0.5mg vs. 0.40 for placebo (p<0.001). Percentage of patients without relapse: 70% for Gilenya 0.5mg vs. 46% for placebo (p<0.001). The mean (median) number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions over 24 months was 2.5 for Gilenya 0.5mg vs. 9.8 for placebo (p<0.001).
Study Two
This 1-year randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled study enrolled 1,292 subjects with RRMS who had not received any natalizumab in the previous 6 months. The subjects were randomized to receive Gilenya 0.5 mg, 1.25 mg or interferon beta-1a, 30 micrograms via the intramuscular route (IM) once weekly for up to 12 months. The annualized relapse rate was significantly lower in patients treated with Gilenya 0.5 mg than in patients who received interferon beta-1a IM. The 1.25 mg dose resulted in no additional benefit over the Gilenya 0.5 mg dose. The results are as follows: Annualized relapse rate 0.16 for Gilenya 0.5mg vs. 0.33 for Interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). Percentage of patients without relapse: 83% for Gilenya 0.5mg vs. 70% for Interferon beta-1a (p<0.001). The mean (median) number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions over 24 months was 1.6 for Gilenya 0.5mg vs. 2.6 for IFN beta (p=0.002).
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Gilenya may include, but are not limited to, the following:
headache
influenza
diarrhea
back pain
liver transaminase elevations
cough
",,"Mechanism of Action
Gilenya is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator and binds with high affinity to sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1, 3, 4, and 5. Fingolimod-phosphate blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from lymph nodes, reducing the number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood. The mechanism by which fingolimod exerts therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is unknown, but may involve reduction of lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system.

Multiple Sclerosis,Lemtrada (alemtuzumab),"General Information
Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD52, a protein abundant on T and B cells. Circulating T and B cells are thought to be responsible for the damaging inflammatory process in MS. Alemtuzumab depletes circulating T and B lymphocytes after each treatment course. Lymphocyte counts then increase over time with a reconstitution of the lymphocyte population that varies for the different lymphocyte subtypes.
Lemtrada is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Because of its safety profile, the use of Lemtrada should generally be reserved for patients who have had an inadequate response to two or more drugs indicated for the treatment of MS.
Lemtrada is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion. The recommended treatment is two annual treatment courses. The first treatment course is administered via intravenous infusion on five consecutive days, and the second course is administered on three consecutive days, 12 months later.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Lemtrada was based on two phase III randomized, open-label,blinded studies comparing treatment with Lemtrada to Rebif (high-dose subcutaneous interferon beta-1a) in patients with relapsing remitting MS who were either new to treatment (CARE-MS I) or who had relapsed while on prior therapy (CARE-MS II).
CARE-MS 1
This trial enrolled 581 subjects who had not received treatment. The trial compared alemtuzumab to Rebif according to two co-primary endpoints: the time to sustained accumulation of disability and the annualized relapse rate. Alemtuzumab was dosed at 12 mg/day for five days by daily IV infusion, with a second dosing 12 months later of 12 mg/day for three days. Rebif was administered three times per week. Lemtrada was significantly more effective than Rebif at reducing annualized relapse rate (0.18 for Lemtrada and 0.39 for interferon beta-1a (p<0.0001) a 55 percent relative reduction. The difference observed in proportion of patients with disability progression at year two did not reach statistical significance (8% for Lemtrada and 11% for Rebif (p=0.22)), a relative risk reduction of 30 percent. The percent of patients remaining relapse-free at year two for Lemtrada was 78% vs. 59% for Rebif (p<0.0001). The percent change in T2 lesion volume from baseline did not reach statistical significance (-9.3 for Lemtrada and -6.5 for Rebif, p=0.31).
CARE-MS II
This trial enrolled 840 subjects who had relapsed on prior therapy. The subjects received alemtuzumab intravenous 12 mg per day for 5 consecutive days, and again for three days one year later, or treatment with Rebif 44 mcg administered by injection three times per week throughout the two years of study. Lemtrada was significantly more effective than Rebif at reducing annualized relapse rates (0.26 for Lemtrada and 0.52 for interferon beta 1-a, p<0.0001, a 49 percent relative reduction). The proportion of patients with confirmed six-month disability progression was significantly lower for Lemtrada (13% for Lemtrada vs. 21% for Rebif, p=0.0084), a 42 percent relative risk reduction. The percent of patients remaining relapse-free at year two for Lemtrada was 65% vs. 47% for Rebif (p<0.0001). The percent change in T2 lesion volume from baseline did not reach statistical significance (-1.3 for Lemtrada and -1.2 for Rebif, p=0.14).
","Side Effects
The Lemtrada label includes a boxed warning noting a risk of serious, sometimes fatal autoimmune conditions, serious and life-threatening infusion reactions and also noting Lemtrada may cause an increased risk of malignancies including thyroid cancer, melanoma and lymphoproliferative disorders. Lemtrada is only available through a restricted distribution program, the Lemtrada REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy).

Multiple Sclerosis,Mavenclad (cladribine),"General Information
Mavenclad (cladribine) is a purine antimetabolite.
Mavenclad is specifically indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. Because of its safety profile, use of Mavenclad is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of MS.
Mavenclad is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. Mavenclad can be taken with or without food. The tablets can be taken with water and swallowed whole without chewing. Prior to administration patients should be screened for the following:
â€¢ Cancer due to increased risk of malignancies (see side effects)
â€¢ Pregnancy
â€¢ Complete Blood Count (CBC): obtain a CBC with differential including lymphocyte count
â€¢ Infections including HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C and acute infections. Vaccination of patients who are antibody-negative for varicella zoster virus is recommended prior to initiation of Mavenclad. Administer all immunizations according to immunization guidelines prior to starting Mavenclad. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting Mavenclad. Obtain a baseline (within 3 months) magnetic resonance imaging prior to the first treatment course because of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
â€¢ Liver injury: Obtain serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels
The recommended cumulative dosage of Mavenclad is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearly treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course) . Please refer to drug label for weight-based chart. Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles:
Administration of First Treatment Course
â€¢ First Course/First Cycle: start any time.
â€¢ First Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of First Course/First Cycle.
Administration of Second Treatment Course
â€¢ Second Course/First Cycle: administer at least 43 weeks after the last dose of First Course/Second Cycle.
â€¢ Second Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of Second Course/First Cycle.
Administer the cycle dosage as 1 or 2 tablets once daily over 4 or 5 consecutive days. Do not administer more than 2 tablets daily. Following the administration of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional Mavenclad treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy.
If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses. If a dose is not taken on the scheduled day, then the patient must take the missed dose on the following day and extend the number of days in that treatment cycle. If two consecutive doses are missed, the treatment cycle is extended by 2 days.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Mavenclad was based on a 96-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in patients with relapsing forms of MS. Patients were required to have at least 1 relapse in the previous 12 months. The median age was 39 years and over two thirds of the study patients were treatment-naive for drugs used to treat relapsing forms of MS. The trial enrolled 1,326 patients who were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 437), or a cumulative oral dosage of Mavenclad 3.5 mg per kg (n = 433) or 5.25 mg per kg body weight (n = 456) over the 96-week study period in 2 treatment courses. Patients randomized to the 3.5 mg per kg cumulative dose received a first treatment course at Weeks 1 and 5 of the first year and a second treatment course at Weeks 1 and 5 of the second year. Patients randomized to the 5.25 mg per kg cumulative dose received additional treatment at Weeks 9 and 13 of the first year. Higher cumulative doses did not add any clinically meaningful benefit, but were associated with a higher incidence in grade 3 lymphopenia or higher (44.9% in the 5.25 mg per kg group vs. 25.6% in the 3.5 mg per kg group). Ninety-two percent of patients treated with Mavenclad 3.5 mg per kg and 87% of patients receiving placebo completed the full 96 weeks of the study. The primary outcome of Study 1 was the annualized relapse rate (ARR). Mavenclad 3.5 mg per kg cumulative dose significantly lowered the ARR; patients experienced a 58% relative reduction compared to placebo (0.14 vs. 0.33, p<0.001). In addition, 81% of patients were free of relapses after two years of short-course oral treatment with Mavenclad, compared to 63% of patients who received placebo (p<0.05). Patients treated with Mavenclad had a 33% reduction in risk of 3-month confirmed disability progression as measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) compared to placebo (p<0.05). Patients taking Mavenclad experienced a lower median number of T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced brain lesions and new or enlarging T2 brain lesions compared to patients with placebo (0 vs. 0.33 and 0 vs. 0.67, p<0.001).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Mavenclad may include, but are not limited to, the following:
upper respiratory tract infection
headache
lymphopenia
The Mavenclad drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning: Mavenclad may increase the risk of malignancy. Mavenclad is contraindicated in patients with current malignancy; evaluate the benefits and risks on an individual basis for patients with prior or increased risk of malignancy. Risk of Teratogenicity: Mavenclad is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception because of the risk of fetal harm.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Mavenclad (cladribine) is a purine antimetabolite. The mechanism by which cladribine exerts its therapeutic effects in patients with multiple sclerosis has not been fully elucidated but is thought to involve cytotoxic effects on B and T lymphocytes through impairment of DNA synthesis, resulting in depletion of lymphocytes.

Mayzent (siponimod) is a sphingosine1-phosphate receptor modulator.
Mayzent is specifically indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults.
Mayzent is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. Prior to administration the following should be assessed:
â€¢ CYP2C9 Genotype Determination: Test patients for CYP2C9 variants to determine CYP2C9 genotype. An FDA-cleared or -approved test for the detection of CYP2C9 variants to direct the use of siponimod is not currently available.
â€¢ Complete Blood Count: Review results of a recent complete blood count (CBC).
â€¢ Ophthalmic Evaluation: Obtain an evaluation of the fundus, including the macula.
â€¢ Cardiac Evaluation: Obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present. In patients with certain preexisting conditions, advice from a cardiologist and first-dose monitoring is recommended. Determine whether patients are taking drugs that could slow heart rate or atrioventricular (AV) conduction.
â€¢ Current or Prior Medications: If patients are taking anti-neoplastic, immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies, or if there is a history of prior use of these drugs, consider possible unintended additive immunosuppressive effects before initiating treatment with Mayzent.
â€¢ Vaccinations: Test patients for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (VZV) before initiating Mayzent; VZV vaccination of antibody negative patients is recommended prior to commencing treatment with Mayzent.
â€¢ Liver Function Tests: Obtain recent (i.e., within last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels.
The recommended dosing is as follows:
Patients With CYP2C9 Genotypes *1/*1, *1/*2, or *2/*2
Maintenance Dosage After treatment titration: (see Treatment Initiation), the recommended maintenance dosage of Mayzent is 2 mg taken orally once daily starting on Day 6. Dosage adjustment is required in patients with a CYP2C9*1/*3 or *2/*3 genotype. Treatment Initiation: Initiate Mayzent with a 5-day titration. Please refer to drug label for titration schedule. A starter pack should be used for patients who will be titrated to the 2-mg maintenance dosage.
Patients With CYP2C9 Genotypes *1/*3 or *2/*3
Maintenance Dosage: In patients with a CYP2C9*1/*3 or *2/*3 genotype, after treatment titration (see Treatment Initiation), the recommended maintenance dosage of Mayzent is 1 mg taken orally once daily starting on Day 5. Treatment Initiation: Initiate Mayzent with a 4-day titration. Please refer to the drug label for titration schedule. Do not use the starter pack for patients who will be titrated to the 1-mg maintenance dosage.
First Dose Monitoring in Patients With Certain Preexisting Cardiac Conditions
Because initiation of Mayzent treatment results in a decrease in heart rate (HR), first-dose 6 hour monitoring is recommended for patients with sinus bradycardia [HR less than 55 beats per minute (bpm)], first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure.
First Dose 6-Hour Monitoring: Administer the first dose of Mayzent in a setting where resources to appropriately manage symptomatic bradycardia are available. Monitor patients for 6 hours after the first dose for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly pulse and blood pressure measurement. Obtain an ECG in these patients at the end of the Day 1 observation period.
Additional Monitoring After 6-Hour Monitoring: If any of the following abnormalities are present after 6 hours (even in the absence of symptoms), continue monitoring until the abnormality resolves: â€¢ The heart rate 6 hours post-dose is less than 45 bpm; â€¢ The heart rate 6 hours post-dose is at the lowest value post-dose, suggesting that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect on the heart may not have occurred; â€¢ The ECG 6 hours post-dose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block. If post-dose symptomatic bradycardia, bradyarrhythmia, or conduction related symptoms occur, or if ECG 6 hours post-dose shows new onset second degree or higher AV block or QTc greater than or equal to 500 msec, initiate appropriate management, begin continuous ECG monitoring, and continue monitoring until the symptoms have resolved if no pharmacological treatment is required. If pharmacological treatment is required, continue monitoring overnight and repeat 6-hour monitoring after the second dose.
Reinitiation of Mayzent After Treatment Interruption
After the initial titration is complete, if Mayzent treatment is interrupted for 4 or more consecutive daily doses, reinitiate treatment with Day 1 of the titration regimen; also complete first dose monitoring in patients for whom it is recommended.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Mayzent was based on the phase III EXPAND trial. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety of Mayzent versus placebo in 1,651 subjects with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) who had evidence of disability progression in the prior 2 years, no evidence of relapse in 3 months prior to study enrollment, and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 3.0-6.5 at study entry. Patients were randomized to receive either once daily Mayzent 2 mg or placebo, beginning with a dose titration. Evaluations were performed at screening, every 3 months during the study, and at the time of a suspected relapse. MRI evaluations were performed at screening and every 12 months. The primary endpoint of the study was the time to 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), defined as at least a 1-point increase from baseline in EDSS (0.5-point increase for patients with baseline EDSS of 5.5 or higher) sustained for 3 months. Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of three-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) (primary endpoint; 21% reduction versus placebo, p=0.013; 33% reduction versus placebo in patients with relapse activity in the two years prior to screening, p=0.01). Mayzent also reduced the annualized relapse rate (ARR) by 55%.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Mayzent may include, but are not limited to, the following:
headache
hypertension
transaminase increases
",,"Mechanism of Action
Mayzent (siponimod) is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Siponimod binds with high affinity to S1P receptors 1 and 5. Siponimod blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from lymph nodes, reducing the number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood. The mechanism by which siponimod exerts therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is unknown, but may involve reduction of lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system.

Multiple Sclerosis,Novantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride),"General Information
Novantrone has been approved for use in reducing neurologic disability and/or the frequency of relapses in patients with secondary (chronic) progressive, progressive relapsing, or worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (i.e., patients whose neurologic status is significantly abnormal between relapses). Novantrone is not indicated for the treatment of patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis.
White blood cells can produce the symptoms of multiple sclerosis by attacking myelin, a fatty substance that surrounds nerve cells. Novantrone suppresses the activity of T and B cells, and in this manner slows the progression of the disease and reduces the frequency of relapses.
Multiple sclerosis is diagnosed in over 350,000 people in the United States. There is no one group of people who ""get"" multiple sclerosis; however, trends show that it often strikes between the ages of 30 and 50, and affects mostly women. Multiple sclerosis is most commonly found in Canada, the United States, South America, and Europe. (from the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation)
Clinical Results
The safety and effectiveness of Novantrone in multiple sclerosis were assessed in two randomized, controlled multicenter trials. One trial was conducted in subjects with secondary progressive or progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis. Neurological disability was evaluated based on the Kutzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). This scale ranges from 0.0 to 10.0, with increasing scores indicating worsening condition. Subjects receive a placebo, 5 mg/m2 Novantrone, or 12 mg/m2 Novantrone administered intravenously every three months for two years. At 24 months, the mean EDSS change (month 24 value minus baseline) was 0.23 for the placebo group, -0.23 for 5 mg/m2, and -0.13 for 12 mg/m2.
A second trial evaluated Novantrone in combination with methylprednisolone (MP) and was conducted in subjects with secondary progressive or worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who had residual neurological deficit between relapses. A total of 42 subjects received monthly treatments of 1g of intravenous MP alone or approximately 12 mg/m2 of intravenous Novantrone plus 1 g of intravenous MP for six months. Subjects were evaluated monthly, and study outcome was determined after six months. The primary measure of effectiveness was a comparison of the proportion of subjects in each treatment group who developed no new Gd-enhancing MRI lesions at six months. Thirty-one percent of subjects receiving MP alone were without new Gd-enhancing lesions on MRIs, while 90% of subjects receiving Novantrone plus MP were without lesions.

","Side Effects
Possible adverse events associated with Novantrone include (but are not limited to) the following:
Nausea
Hair loss
Hypotension (low blood pressure)
Rashes
Urinary tract infection
Menstrual disorder
",,"Mechanism of Action
Mitoxantrone, a DNA-reactive agent that intercalates into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) through hydrogen bonding, causes crosslinks and strand breaks. Mitoxantrone also interferes with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and is a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase II, an enzyme responsible for uncoiling and repairing damaged DNA. It has a cytocidal effect on both proliferating and nonproliferating cultured human cells, suggesting lack of cell cycle phase specificity.
Novantrone has been shown in vitro to inhibit B cell, T cell, and macrophage proliferation and impair antigen presentation, as well as the secretion of interferon gamma, TNFa, and IL-2.

Multiple Sclerosis,Ocrevus (ocrelizumab),"General Information
Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) is a CD20-directed cytolytic antibody.
Ocrevus is specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing or primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis.
Ocrevus is supplied as a solution for intravenous administration. Hepatitis B virus screening is required before the first dose. Pre-medicate with methylprednisolone (or an equivalent corticosteroid) and an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) prior to each infusion. The recommended starting dose of Ocrevus is a 300 mg intravenous infusion, followed two weeks later by a second 300 mg intravenous infusion. Subsequent doses: 600 mg intravenous infusion every 6 months. Ocrevus must be diluted prior to administration. Patients should be monitored closely during and for at least one hour after infusion.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ocrevus was based on two randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active comparator-controlled clinical trials of identical design, in patients with RMS treated for 96 weeks (Study 1 and Study 2). The dose of Ocrevus was 600 mg every 24 weeks (initial treatment was given as two 300 mg IV infusions administered 2 weeks apart, and subsequent doses were administered as a single 600 mg IV infusion) and placebo subcutaneous injections were given 3 times per week. The dose of REBIF, the active comparator, was 44 mcg given as subcutaneous injections 3 times per week and placebo IV infusions were given every 24 weeks. Both studies included patients who had experienced at least one relapse within the prior year, or two relapses within the prior two years, and had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from 0 to 5.5. The primary outcome of both studies was the annualized relapse rate (ARR). In Study 1, 410 patients were randomized to Ocrevus and 411 to REBIF; 11% of Ocrevus-treated and 17% of REBIF-treated patients did not complete the 96-week double-blind treatment period. In Study 2, 417 patients were randomized to Ocrevus and 418 to REBIF; 14% of Ocrevus-treated and 23% of REBIF-treated patients did not complete the 96-week double-blind treatment period. In both studies, Ocrevus significantly lowered the annualized relapse rate and the proportion of patients with disability progression confirmed at 12 weeks after onset compared to REBIF. ARR endpoint: 46% (p<0.0001) (Study 1) and 47% (p<0.0001) (Study 2). The primary population for analysis of confirmed disability progression was the pooled population from Studies 1 and 2: 9.8% Ocrevus versus 15.2% REBIF.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Ocrevus may include, but are not limited to, the following:
upper respiratory tract infections
infusion reaction
",,"Mechanism of Action
Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) is a CD20-directed cytolytic antibody. The precise mechanism by which ocrelizumab exerts its therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is unknown, but is presumed to involve binding to CD20, a cell surface antigen present on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. Following cell surface binding to B lymphocytes, ocrelizumab results in antibody-dependent cellular cytolysis and complement-mediated lysis.

Multiple Sclerosis,Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a),"General Information
Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) is a subcutaneous injectable therapy, in which interferon beta-1a is pegylated to extend its half-life to permit a less frequent dosing schedule.
Plegridy is specifically indicated for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.
Plegridy is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous administration. The recommended dosage of Plegridy is 125 micrograms injected subcutaneously every 14 days. Patients should start treatment with 63 micrograms on day 1. On day 15 (14 days later), the dose is increased to 94 micrograms, reaching the full dose of 125 micrograms on day 29 (after another 14 days). Patients should continue with the full dose (125 micrograms) every 14 days thereafter.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Plegridy was based on a randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled, one-year study. The trial compared clinical and MRI outcomes at 48 weeks in patients who received Plegridy 125 micrograms (n=512) or placebo (n=500) subcutaneously once every 14 days. All subjects had a baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from 0 to 5, had experienced at least 2 relapses within the previous three years, and had experienced at least 1 relapse in the previous year. None of the subjects had progressive MS. Neurological evaluations were scheduled at baseline, every 12 weeks, and at the time of a suspected relapse. Brain MRI evaluations were scheduled at baseline, week 24, and week 48. The primary outcome was the annualized relapse rate over 1 year. The annualized relapse rate was 0.26 in the Plegridy arm and 0.40 in the placebo arm; relative reduction 36% (p=0.0007).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Plegridy may include, but are not limited to, the following:
injection site erythema
influenza-like illness
pyrexia
headache
myalgia
chills
injection site pain asthenia
injection site pruritus
arthralgia
",,"Mechanism of Action
Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) is a subcutaneous injectable therapy, in which interferon beta-1a is pegylated to extend its half-life to permit a less frequent dosing schedule. Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) is a polypeptide, normally produced by fibroblasts, that has antiviral and antiproliferative effects. Binding of IFN-beta to its receptor induces a complex transcriptional response. In immune cells (the most likely target of IFN-beta's therapeutic effect in MS), IFN-beta reduces antigen presentation and T-cell proliferation, alters cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, and restores suppressor function. Therapeutic forms of IFN-beta can be produced in bacterial expression systems (IFN-beta1b) or in mammalian cells (IFN-beta1a). The exact mechanism by which Plegridy exerts its effects in patients with multiple sclerosis is unknown.

Multiple Sclerosis,Rebif (interferon beta-1a),"General Information
Rebif (interferon beta-1a) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Rebif has been shown to decrease the frequency of clinical exacerbations and delay the accumulation of physical disability in patients with MS. The recommended dose of the product is 44 mcg three times per week to be administered by subcutaneous injection. Rebif is supplied in single-use, pre-filled syringes.
Rebif previously was approved in Europe in 1998 and currently is registered for use in over 70 countries.
Clinical Results
The approval of Rebif was based on the results of two large multi-center studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of the drug in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The first study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of 560 subjects with multiple sclerosis for at least one year. Subjects received either placebo, Rebif 22 mcg or Rebif 44 mcg administered three times a week for a duration of two years. Results indicated that both the 22 mcg and 44 mcg doses of Rebif significantly reduced the number of exacerbations per subject as compared to placebo. There was no statistically significant difference between percent reduction of exacerbations in subjects receiving 22 mcg (29% reduction) and 44 mcg (32% reduction). A secondary endpoint was the progression of disability, defined as an increase in the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of at least 1 point sustained for at least 3 months. Results showed that the time to onset of progression in disability sustained for three months was significantly longer in subjects treated with either dose or Rebif than in subjects received placebo only.
The second study was a randomized, open-label, evaluator-blinded, active comparator study comparing the effects of Rebif 44 mcg to those of Avonex 30 mcg in 677 subjects with RRMS who had not been treated with interferon before. Subjects received either Rebif 44 mcg (three times weekly, subcutaneously) or Avonex 30 mcg (once weekly, intramuscularly) and underwent repeated clinical and MRI assessments during the course of treatment. Results showed that during the first 24 weeks of treatment, 75% of subjects receiving Rebif did not experience a relapse, compared to 63% of subjects receiving Avonex who did not experience a relapse during the same period. This difference was statistically significant. In addition, researchers assessed the combined unique active lesions as measured by MRI. At 24 weeks, Rebif-treated subjects had an average of 0.8 active lesions per scan, while Avonex-treated patients averaged 1.2 leasions per scan. This represents a reduction of approximately one-third of lesion activity in the subjects receiving Rebif.
","Side Effects
In clinical trials, the most commonly reported adverse reactions to Rebif were:
Injection site disorders
Flu-like symptoms
Abdominal pain
Depression
Elevation of liver enzymes
Blood cell abnormalities
Depression and suicidal indeation have been reported to occur more frequently in patients being treated with interferon compounds, including Rebif.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Interferons are a family of naturally occurring proteins that are produced by eukaryotic cells in response to viral infection and other biological inducers. Interferons possess immunomodulatory, antiviral and antiproliferative biological activities. They exert their biological effects by binding to specific receptors on the surface of cellsâ€¦ Type 1 interferons have considerably overlapping but also distinct biological activities. Interferon beta is produced naturally by various cell types including fibroblasts and macrophages. Binding of interferon beta to its receptors initiates a complex cascade of intracellular events that leads to the expression of numerous interferon-induced gene products and markers, including 2â€™,5â€™-oligoadenylate synthetase, beta 2-microglubin and neopterin, which may mediate some of the biological activities. The specific interfereon-induced proteins and mechanisms by which interferon beta-1a exterts its effects in multiple sclerosis have not been fully defined. (from Rebif package insert)

Multiple Sclerosis,Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate),"General Information
Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) is an oral, small molecule immune modulator. The mechanism by which dimethyl fumarate exerts its therapeutic effect in multiple sclerosis is unknown. However, it has been postulated that dimethyl fumarate has the potential to reduce the activity and impact of inflammatory cells on the central nervous system (CNS) and induce direct cytoprotective responses in CNS cells.
Tecfidera is specifically indicated for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.
Tecfidera is supplied as a delayed-release capsule for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is 120 mg twice a day orally. After 7 days, the dose should be increased to the maintenance dose of 240 mg twice a day orally. Tecfidera should be swallowed whole and intact. It can be taken with or without food.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Tecfidera was based on two studies (Studies 1 and 2) that evaluated Tecfidera taken either twice or three times a day in subjects with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).
Study One:
This 2-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 1,234 subjects who received Tecfidera 240 mg twice a day (BID), 240 mg three times a day (TID) or placebo for up to 2 years. The median time on study drug for all treatment arms was 96 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients relapsed at 2 years. Additional endpoints at 2 years included the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions, number of new T1 hypointense lesions, number of Gd+ lesions, annualized relapse rate (ARR), and time to confirmed disability progression. All endpoints were reached with statistical significance. The Tecfidera 240 mg three times daily dose showed no additional benefit over the twice daily dose. For the primary endpoint: the proportion of patients relapsed at 2 years was 27% in the Tecfidera 240 mg BID arm versus 46% in the placebo arm (p<0.0001).
Study Two:
This 2-year multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included an open-label comparator arm in subjects with RRMS. A total of 1,067 subjects were randomized to Tecfidera 240 mg BID, 240 mg TID or placebo for up to 2 years. The median time on study drug for all treatment arms was 96 weeks. The primary endpoint was the annualized relapse rate at 2 years. Additional endpoints at 2 years included the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions, number of T1 hypointense lesions, number of Gd+ lesions, proportion of patients relapsed, and time to confirmed disability progression. Tecfidera had a statistically significant effect on the relapse and MRI endpoints. There was no statistically significant effect on disability progression. The Tecfidera 240 mg TID dose resulted in no additional benefit over the 240 mg BID dose. For the primary endpoint, annualized relapse rate at 2 years: 0.224 for the Tedfidera 240 mg BID arm and 0.401 for the placebo arm (p<0.0001).

Multiple Sclerosis,Tysabri (natalizumab),"General Information
TYSABRI (natalizumab) is a recombinant humanized IgG4k monoclonal antibody produced in murine myeloma cells. In development, TYSABRI was originally slated to be named Antegren, but FDA regulators forced a change due to name confusion with existing products such as Integrilin and Edecrin.
TYSABRI is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis to reduce the frequency of clinical exacerbations. This indication is based on results achieved after approximately one year of treatment in ongoing controlled trials of two years in duration. The safety and efficacy of TYSABRI beyond one year are unknown.
The recommended dose of TYSABRI is 300 mg IV infusion every four weeks.
On February 28, 2005, Biogen Idec and Elan announced a voluntary suspension of the marketing of TYSABRI.
On June 5, 2006 Biogen Idec and Elan announced the approval of a supplemental Biologics License Agreement (sBLA) by the FDA, for the reintroduction of TYSABRI as a monotherapy treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. This approval for reintroduction was based on the review of TYSABRI trial data, a revised labeling with enhanced safety warnings and a risk management plan (TOUCH Prescribing Program) designed to inform of the potential risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).
Clinical Results
FDA approval of TYSABRI for the treatment of MS was based on two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with over 2,000 subjects. Subjects were enrolled if they had experienced at least one relapse during the prior year and had a score of between 0 - 5.0 on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). In both studies, neurological evaluations were performed every 12 weeks and at times of suspected relapse. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluations for T1-weighted gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions and T2-hyperintense lesions were performed annually.
Study 1
All 942 subjects enrolled in this study had not received any interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate for at least the previous 6 months. In fact, roughly 94% had never been treated with these agents. The median age was 37, with a median disease duration of 5 years. Subjects were randomized to receive TYSABRI (300mg IV infusion) or placebo every 4 weeks for up to 28 months. Results showed that subjects who received TYSABRI had a relapse rate (annualized) of .25 compared with .74 for subjects taking placebo. 76% of subjects taking TYSABRI had remained relapse free compared with 53% of subjects taking placebo.
Study 2
All 1,171 subjects enrolled in this study had experienced one or more relapses while on treatment with Interferon beta-1a (30 mcg intramuscularly) once weekly during the year prior to study entry. The median age was 39, with a median disease duration of 7 years. Subjects were randomized to receive TYSABRI (300mg IV infusion) or placebo every 4 weeks for up to 28 months. Subjects continued taking Interferon beta-1a at their normal dosing once weekly. Results showed that subjects who received TYSABRI had a relapse rate (annualized) of .36 compared with .78 for subjects taking placebo. Data demonstrated that 67% of subjects taking TYSABRI had remained relapse free compared with 46% of subjects taking placebo.

Adverse events associated with the use of TYSABRI may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Infections
Hypersensitivity Reactions
Depression
Cholelithiasis (gallstones)
Urticaria (hives)
Irregular menstruation
",,"Mechanism of Action
MS is an auto-immune disease that damages and prevents the creation of the tissues that protect nerves, called myelin. This creates lesions, or scar tissue known as sclerosis. Lesions are believed to occur when activated inflammatory cells, including T-lymphocytes, cross the blood-brain barrier. Leukocyte migration involves interaction between adhesion molecules on inflammatory cells, and their counter-receptors present on endothelial cells of the vessel wall. The drug works by blocking the integrin molecule and preventing immune cells from migrating through blood vessels in the brain to areas of inflammation; however the specific mechanism by which TYSABRI exerts its effects in multiple sclerosis have not been fully defined.
Preclinical results from animal models of autoimmune encephalitis of multiple sclerosis demonstrated a reduction of leukocyte migration into brain parenchyma and reduction of plaque formation detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following repeated administration of natalizumab. The clinical significance of these animal data is unknown.

Multiple Sclerosis,Vumerity (diroximel fumarate),"General Information
Vumerity (diroximel fumarate) is a novel oral fumarate with a distinct chemical structure.
Vumerity is specifically indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults.
Vumerity is supplied as a capsule for oral administration.
Obtain the following prior to treatment with Vumerity: â€¢ A complete blood cell count (CBC), including lymphocyte count. â€¢ Serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels. (See ","Side Effects)
Dosing Information The starting dosage for Vumerity is 231 mg twice a day orally. After 7 days, the dosage should be increased to the maintenance dosage of 462 mg (administered as two 231 mg capsules) twice a day orally. Temporary dosage reductions to 231 mg twice a day may be considered for individuals who do not tolerate the maintenance dosage. Within 4 weeks, the recommended dosage of 462 mg twice a day should be resumed. Discontinuation of Vumerity should be considered for patients unable to tolerate return to the maintenance dosage. Administration of non-enteric coated aspirin (up to a dose of 325 mg) 30 minutes prior to Vumerity dosing may reduce the incidence or severity of flushing.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Vumerity was based on a New Drug Application (NDA) submitted under the 505(b)(2) filing pathway. It included data from pharmacokinetic bridging studies comparing Vumerity and Tecfidera to establish bioequivalence, and relied, in part, on the FDA's findings of safety and efficacy for Tecfidera.
The NDA submission also included interim exposure and safety findings from EVOLVE-MS-1, an ongoing, Phase 3, single-arm, open-label, two-year safety study evaluating Vumerity in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Interim results from EVOLVE-MS-1 at the time of NDA submission included a low overall rate of Vumerity treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (6.3 percent), and a rate of less than one percent of patients who discontinued Vumerity treatment due to gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events. Additional exploratory efficacy endpoints in the ongoing EVOLVE-MS-1 study showed changes in clinical and radiological measures compared to baseline. The annualized relapse rate at a median follow-up of 0.93 patient-years (total, 497.1 patient-years) in 578 patients enrolled to date in the 2-year, open-label study was just 0.16. In addition, a statistically significant 80% reduction from baseline was seen in the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions in 374 patients who completed a 1-year MRI assessment (from a mean of 1.5 to 0.3).

Multiple Sclerosis,Zinbryta (daclizumab),"General Information
Zinbryta (daclizumab) is an interleukin-2 receptor blocking humanized monoclonal antibody.
Zinbrtya is specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Because of its safety profile, the use of Zinbryta should generally be reserved for patients who have had an inadequate response to two or more drugs indicated for the treatment of MS.
Zinbrtya is supplied as a solution for subcutaneous injection. The recommended dose is 150 milligrams injected subcutaneously once monthly. Patients should inject a missed dose as soon as possible but no more than two weeks late. After two weeks, skip the missed dose and take the next dose on schedule. Administer only one dose at a time. Please see drug label for specific administration instructions.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Zinbryta was based on two randomized, double-blind, controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2). Both studies evaluated 150 mg of subcutaneous Zinbryta taken once every four weeks in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS).
Study 1: Active-Controlled Trial in RMS. Study 1 compared Zinbryta to 30 mcg weekly intramuscular doses of Avonex in 1,841 patients for 144 weeks. The primary outcome measure of Study 1 was the annualized relapse rate (ARR). Zinbryta had a statistically significant effect on the annualized relapse rate and on the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions.

Muscle Pain,Amrix (cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended release),"General Information
Amrix (cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride) is a once daily extended release skeletal muscle relaxant which relieves muscle spasm of local origin without interfering with muscle function. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. However, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride is thought to act primarily at brain stem (and to a lesser extent at spinal cord level) to relieve skeletal muscle spasms of local origin without altering muscle function.
Amris is specifically indicated as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions.
Amrix is supplied as 15mg and 30mg capsules for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is one (1) 15 mg capsule taken once daily. Some patients may require up to 30 mg/day, given as one (1) 30 mg capsule taken once daily or as two (2) 15 mg capsules taken once daily. It is recommended that doses be taken at approximately the same time each day. Use of Amrix for periods longer than two or three weeks is not recommended.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Amrix was based on the results of two identical double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies: Study 1105 evaluated 30 mg of Amrix and Study 1106 studied 15 mg of Amrix both taken once daily for 14 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the patientâ€™s rating of medication helpfulness, measured at Day 4 and Day 14, between the two Amrix arms versus placebo. The primary endpoint was reached with signifcance for both Amrix arms. In addition, one of the two studies demonstrated significant differences between the Amrix 30 mg group and the placebo group in terms of patient-rated relief from local pain due to muscle spasm at Day 4 and Day 8, in subject-rated restriction of movement at Day 4 and Day 8, and in patient-rated global impression of change at Day 4, Day 8, and Day 14.

Leukemia,Blincyto (blinatumomab),"General Information
Blincyto (blinatumomab) is an immunotherapy. It engages the bodyâ€™s T-cells, a type of white blood cell or lymphocyte, to destroy leukemia cells. The drug acts as a connector between a protein called CD19, which is found on the surface of most B-cell lymphoblasts, and CD3, a protein on T-cell lymphocytes.
Blincyto is specifically indicated for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Blincyto is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion. Hospitalization is recommended for the first 9 days of the first cycle and the first 2 days of the second cycle. For all subsequent cycle starts and reinitiation (eg, if treatment is interrupted for 4 or more hours), supervision by a healthcare professional or hospitalization is recommended. Do not flush the Blincyto infusion line, especially when changing infusion bags. Flushing when changing bags or at completion of infusion can result in excess dosage and complications. The recommended dosing schedule is as follows:
A single cycle of treatment of Blincyto consists of 4 weeks of continuous intravenous infusion followed by a 2-week treatment-free interval.
â€¢ For patients at least 45 kg in weight:
- In Cycle 1, administer Blincyto at 9 mcg/day on Days 1â€“7 and at 28 mcg/day on Days 8â€“28.
- For subsequent cycles, administer Blincyto at 28 mcg/day on Days 1â€“28.
â€¢ Allow for at least 2 weeks treatment-free between cycles of Blincyto.
â€¢ A treatment course consists of up to 2 cycles of Blincyto for induction followed by 3 additional cycles for consolidation treatment (up to a total of 5 cycles).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Blincyto was granted under accelerated approval conditions. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in subsequent trials. Accelerated approval was based on an open-label, multicenter, single-arm study in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B precursor ALL. Blincyto was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion. In the first cycle, the initial dose was 9 mcg/day for week 1, then 28 mcg/day for the remaining 3 weeks. The target dose of 28 mcg/day was administered in cycle 2 and subsequent cycles starting on day 1 of each cycle. Dose adjustment was possible in case of adverse events. The treated population included 185 patients who received at least 1 infusion of Blincyto; the median number of treatment cycles was 2. Patients who responded to Blincyto but later relapsed had the option to be retreated with Blincyto. Among treated patients, the median age was 39 years (range: 18 to 79 years), 63 out of 185 (34.1%) had undergone HSCT prior to receiving Blincyto, and 32 out of 185 (17.3%) had received more than 2 prior salvage therapies. The primary endpoint was the complete remission/complete remission with partial hematological recovery (CR/CRh) rate within 2 cycles of treatment with Blincyto. Seventy-seven out of 185 (41.6%) evaluable patients achieved CR/CRh within the first 2 treatment cycles, with the majority of responses (81%, 62 out of 77) occurring within cycle 1 of treatment. The HSCT rate among those who achieved CR/CRh was 39% (30 out of 77).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Blincyto may include, but are not limited to, the following:
pyrexia
headache
peripheral edema
febrile neutropenia
nausea
hypokalemia
tremor
rash
constipation
In addition, Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and neurological toxicities, both of which may be severe, life-threatening, or fatal, occurred in patients receiving Blincyto. Interrupt or discontinue Blincyto as recommended.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Blincyto (blinatumomab) is a bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T-cell engager that binds to CD19 expressed on the surface of cells of B-lineage origin and CD3 expressed on the surface of T cells. It activates endogenous T cells by connecting CD3 in the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex with CD19 on benign and malignant B cells. Blinatumomab mediates the formation of a synapse between the T cell and the tumor cell, upregulation of cell adhesion molecules, production of cytolytic proteins, release of inflammatory cytokines, and proliferation of T cells, which result in redirected lysis of CD19+ cells.

Leukemia,Bosulif (bosutinib),"General Information
Bosulif (bosutinib) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinases a subclass of protein kinase. Tyrosine kinases function as an on or off switch in many cellular functions. They can become mutated and cause unregulated growth of the cell, which is a necessary step for the development of cancer. Bosutinib inhibits the Bcr-Abl kinase that promotes CML amd also inhibits the Src-family kinases.
Bosulif is specifically indicated for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or blast phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.
Bosulif is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended dose is 500 mg orally once daily with food. Continue treatment until disease progression or patient intolerance.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Bosulif was based on a phase I/II single arm, open-label, multicenter trial in in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML. Subjects were enrolled in separate cohorts for chronic, accelerated, and blast phase disease previously treated with one prior TKI (imatinib) or more than one TKI (imatinib followed by dasatinib and/or nilotinib). The protocol was amended to exclude subjects with a known history of the T315I mutation after 396 subjects were enrolled in the trial. A total of 546 subjects were treated with Bosulif 500 mg once daily. Of the 546 treated subjects, 503 were considered evaluable for efficacy. Median duration of Bosulif treatment was 22 months in patients with CP CML previously treated with one TKI (imatinib), 8 months in patients with CP CML previously treated with imatinib and at least 1 additional TKI, 10 months in patients with AP CML previously treated with at least imatinib, and 3 months in patients with BP CML previously treated with at least imatinib. The efficacy endpoints for patients with CP CML previously treated with one prior TKI (imatinib) were the rate of attaining MCyR at week 24 and the duration of MCyR. The efficacy endpoints for patients with CP CML previously treated with both imatinib and at least 1 additional TKI were the cumulative rate of attaining MCyR by week 24 and the duration of MCyR. The efficacy endpoints for patients with previously treated AP and BP CML were confirmed complete hematologic response (CHR) and overall hematologic response (OHR). The results are as follows:
Efficacy Results in Patients with Ph+ CP CML with Resistance to or Intolerance to Imatinib:
Prior Treatment with Imatinib Only: Week 24 MCyR: 90%; Prior Treatment with Imatinib and Dasatinib or Nilotinib: Week 24 MCyR: 29%.

",,"Mechanism of Action
Bosutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Bosutinib inhibits the Bcr-Abl kinase that promotes CML; it is also an inhibitor of Src-family kinases including Src, Lyn, and Hck. Bosutinib inhibited 16 of 18 imatinib-resistant forms of Bcr-Abl expressed in murine myeloid cell lines. Bosutinib did not inhibit the T315I and V299L mutant cells. In mice, treatment with bosutinib reduced the size of CML tumors relative to controls and inhibited growth of murine myeloid tumors expressing several imatinib-resistant forms of Bcr-Abl.

Leukemia,Campath,"General Information
Campath, a humanized monoclonal antibody, has been approved as an injectable treatment for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Campath is designed for use in B-CLL patients who have been treated with alkylating agents and have failed fludarabine therapy. This drug gives refractory B-CLL patients a new hope for treatment, as there are no other approved therapeutic options.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is the most prevalent form of leukemia in adults and affects approximately 120,000 patients in the United States and Europe. B-CLL is characterized by an accumulation of leukemic lymphocytes in the bone marrow, blood, and other body tissues. This accumulation leads to bone marrow dysfunction and enlargement of the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. Related symptoms of the disease include fatigue, bone pain, night sweats, decreased appetite, and weight loss.
Clinical Results
Campath was evaluated in a multi-center, open-label, noncomparative study of 93 B-CLL patients previously treated with alkylating agents, who had failed fludarabine treatment. There were also two supportive, multi-center, open-label, noncomparative trials of Campath enrolling a total of 56 B-CLL patients. Results were determined by objective tumor response rates and duration of response, as defined by the NCI Working Group Response Criteria.
In the largest of the three trials, an overall response rate of 33 percent was observed, with a median duration of seven months. A 30 percent mortality rate was recorded, either during the study or within six months of its completion. Half of these deaths were due to progression of the disease, while the other half were related to Campath therapy. Adverse events associated with Campath therapy included infusion-related events, infections, and hematological toxicity.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Campath therapy may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Neurotropenia
Fever and rigors
Anemia
Thrombocytopenia
Sepsis
Pneumonia
Nausea
Vomiting
Rash
Hypotension
",,"Mechanism of Action
Campath (alemtuzumab) works by binding to the CD52 antigen that is present on the surface of the malignant lymphocytes. After binding, the drug induces antibody-dependent lysis, or killing. This causes the removal of malignant lymphocytes from the blood, bone marrow, and other affected organs.

Elzonris (tagraxofusp-erzs) is a CD123-directed cytotoxin.
Elzonris is specifically indicated for the treatment of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) in adults and in pediatric patients 2 years and older.
Elzonris is supplied as an injection for intravenous administration. The recommended dose of Elzonris is 12 mcg/kg intravenously over 15 minutes once daily on days 1 to 5 of a 21-day cycle. The dosing period may be extended for dose delays up to day 10 of the cycle. Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Prior to the first dose of the first cycle, ensure serum albumin is greater than or equal to 3.2 g/dL before administering Elzonris. Premedicate patients with an H1-histamine antagonist (e.g., diphenhydramine hydrochloride), H2-histamine antagonist (e.g., ranitidine), corticosteroid (e.g., 50 mg intravenous methylprednisolone or equivalent) and acetaminophen (or paracetamol) approximately 60 minutes prior to each Elzonris infusion. Administer Cycle 1 of Elzonris in the inpatient setting with patient observation through at least 24 hours after the last infusion. ï‚· Administer subsequent cycles of Elzonris in the inpatient setting or in a suitable outpatient ambulatory care setting that is equipped with appropriate monitoring for patients with hematopoietic malignancies undergoing treatment. Observe patients for a minimum of 4 hours following each infusion.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Elzonris was based on a multicenter, multi-cohort, open-label, single-arm, clinical trial (STML-401-0114) which enrolled 47 patients with BPDCN, including 32 treatment-naÃ¯ve and 15 previously-treated patients, at seven sites in the U.S. Patients received Elzonris intravenously on days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle for multiple consecutive cycles. The trial consisted of three stages: Stage 1 (lead-in, dose escalation), Stage 2 (expansion) and Stage 3 (pivotal, confirmatory). Patients were also enrolled in an additional cohort (Stage 4) to enable uninterrupted access to Elzonris. In the Stage 3 (pivotal) cohort, 13 patients with treatment-naÃ¯ve BPDCN received Elzonris at the labeled dose and schedule. Efficacy was based on the rate of complete response or clinical complete response (CR/CRc), with CRc defined as complete response with residual skin abnormality not indicative of active disease. In this pivotal cohort, the CR/CRc rate was 53.8% (7/13). The median duration of CR/CRc was not reached (range: 3.9 to 12.2 months). In addition, in 29 treatment-naÃ¯ve patients who received Elzonris at 12 mcg/kg/day, the overall response rate (ORR) was 90% (26/29). In these patients, the CR/CRc rate was 72% (21/29) with a median duration of CR/CRc not reached (range: 1.3 to 32.2 months). Forty-five percent (13/29) of these patients were bridged to stem cell transplant (SCT), following remission on Elzonris. The median overall survival (OS), among 29 treatment-naÃ¯ve patients who received Elzonris at 12 mcg/kg/day was not reached (range: 0.2 to 42.0 months, with median follow-up of 23.0 months [range: 0.2 to 41+ months]).

Leukemia,Erwinaze (asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi),"General Information
Erwinaze (asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi) contains an asparaginase specific enzyme derived from Erwinia chrysanthemi. The mechanism of action of Erwinaze thought to be based on the inability of leukemic cells to synthesize asparagine due to lack of asparagine synthetase activity, resulting in cytotoxicity specific for leukemic cells.
Erwinaze is specifically approved as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase.
Erwinaze is supplied as a solution for intramuscular administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is as follows:
To substitute for a dose of pegaspargase: 25,000 International Units/m2 administered intramuscularly three times a week (Monday/Wednesday/Friday) for six doses for each planned dose of pegaspargase.
To substitute for a dose of native E. coli asparaginase: 25,000 International Units/m2 administered intramuscularly for each scheduled dose of native E. coli asparaginase within a treatment.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Erwinaze was based on a single-arm, multi-center, open-label, safety and clinical pharmacology trial. This trial enrolled 58 subjects with ALL who were unable to continue to receive pegaspargase due to hypersensitivity reactions. The subjects received Erwinaze 25,000 International Units/m2 intramuscularly for two weeks (six total doses) as a replacement for each scheduled dose of pegaspargase remaining on their original treatment protocol.The main endpoint was determination of the proportion of patients who achieved a serum trough asparaginase level greater than or equal to 0.1 International Units/ mL. More than 50% of the subjects reached this endpoint at 48 or 72 hours following the third dose.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Erwinaze may include, but are not limited to, the following:
systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity and urticaria
pancreatitis
abnormal transaminases
coagulation abnormalities including thrombosis and hemorrhage
nausea and vomiting
hyperglycemia
",,"Mechanism of Action
Erwinaze (asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi) contains an asparaginase specific enzyme derived from Erwinia chrysanthemi. Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi catalyzes the deamidation of asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia, resulting in a reduction in circulating levels of asparagine. The mechanism of action of Erwinaze thought to be based on the inability of leukemic cells to synthesize asparagine due to lack of asparagine synthetase activity, resulting in cytotoxicity specific for leukemic cells that depend on an exogenous source of the amino acid asparagine for their protein metabolism and survival.

Leukemia,Imbruvica (ibrutinib),"General Information
Imbruvica (ibrutinib) is an orally available, selective inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), a gene that is disrupted in the human disease X-linked agammaglobulenemia (XLA). BTK is a signaling molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways.
Imbruvica is specifically approved for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma and for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma who carry a deletion in chromosome 17 (17p deletion).
Imbruvica is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended dose is 420 mg taken orally once daily (three 140 mg capsules once daily). Capsules should be taken orally with a glass of water. Do not open, break, or chew the capsules.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Imbruvica for chronic lymphocytic leukemia was based on an open-label, multi-center trial of 48 previously treated patients. Imbruvica was administered orally at 420 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) were assessed using a modified version of the International Workshop on CLL Criteria by an Independent Review Committee. The ORR was 58.3%, all partial responses. None of the patients achieved a complete response. The DOR ranged from 5.6 to 24.2+ months. The median DOR was not reached.
The FDA approved of Imbruvica for CLL with 17p deletion was based on a clinical study of 391 previously treated patients, 127 of whom had CLL with 17p deletion. The patients were randomly assigned to receive Imbruvica or Arzerra until disease progression or side effects became intolerable. The trial was stopped early for efficacy after a pre-planned interim analysis showed Imbruvica-treated patients experienced a 78 percent reduction in risk of disease progression or death (progression-free survival). Results also showed a 57 percent reduction in risk of death (overall survival) in patients treated with Imbruvica. Of the 127 patients who had CLL with 17p deletion, those treated with Imbruvica experienced a 75 percent reduction in risk of disease progression or death.
The FDA approval of Imbruvica as a first-line treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) was based on data from the randomized, multi-center, open-label Phase 3 RESONATE-2 (PCYC-1115) trial, which evaluated the use of Imbruvica versus chlorambucil in 269 treatment-naÃ¯ve patients with CLL or SLL aged 65 years or older. Imbruvica significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; primary endpoint) as determined by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), reducing the risk of progression or death by 84% versus chlorambucil; median PFS: not reached for Imbruvica vs. 18.9 months for chlorambucil). Imbruvica was also associated with a significantly higher IRC-assessed overall response rate (ORR: a composite of complete and partial responses; 82.4% vs. 35.3%) versus chlorambucil. Five patients (3.7 percent) in the Imbruvica arm achieved a complete response, compared to two patients (1.5 percent) in the chlorambucil arm.

Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Kymriah was based on an open-label, multicenter single-arm trial in pediatric and young adults with R/R B-cell precursor ALL. In total, 88 subjects were enrolled and 63 were evaluable for efficacy. Treatment consisted of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (fludarabine 30 mg/m2 daily for 4 days and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 daily for 2 days) followed by a single dose of Kymriah. Of the 22 patients who had a WBC count < 1000/ÂµL, 20 received lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to Kymriah while 2 received Kymriah infusion without lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Fifty-three patients received bridging chemotherapy between time of enrollment and lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The efficacy of Kymriah was established on the basis of complete remission (CR) within 3 months after infusion, the duration of CR, and proportion of patients with CR and minimal residual disease (MRD) < 0.01% by flow cytometry (MRD-negative). Among the 63 infused patients, 52 (83%) achieved CR/CRi, all of which were MRD-negative. With a median follow-up of 4.8 months from response, the median duration of CR/CRi was not reached (range: 1.2 to 14.1+ months). Median time to onset of CR/CRi was 29 days with onset of CR/CRi between 26 and 31 days for 50/52 (96%) responders. The stem cell transplantation rate among those who achieved CR/CRi was 12% (6/52).

The Kymriah label comes with the following Boxed Warning:
Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients receiving Kymriah. Do not administer Kymriah to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab.
Neurological toxicities, which may be severe or life-threatening, can occur following treatment with Kymriah, including concurrently with CRS. Monitor for neurological events after treatment with Kymriah. Provide supportive care as needed.
Kymriah is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Kymriah REMS.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy which involves reprogramming a patientâ€™s own T cells with a transgene encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to identify and eliminate CD19-expressing malignant and normal cells. The CAR is comprised of a murine single-chain antibody fragment which recognizes CD19 and is fused to intracellular signaling domains from 4-1BB (CD137) and CD3 zeta. The CD3 zeta component is critical for initiating T-cell activation and antitumor activity, while 4-1BB enhances the expansion and persistence of Kymriah. Upon binding to CD19-expressing cells, the CAR transmits a signal to promote T-cell expansion, activation, target cell elimination, and persistence of the Kymriah cells

Limb Spasticity,Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA),"General Information
Botox for injection is a sterile, vacuum-dried purified botulinum toxin type A, produced from fermentation of Hall strain Clostridium botulinum type A. Botox blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to acceptor sites on motor or sympathetic nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter in both the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system and causes the activation of muscle movement.
Among other indications, Botox has been approved specifically for upper limb spasticity in adult patients, to decrease the severity of increased muscle tone in elbow flexors, wrist flexors and finger flexors. Botox was subsequently approved in June of 2019 for patients ages 2 to 17 years with upper limb spasticity.
Botox is supplied as a vacuum-dried powder for reconstitution with sterile, non-preserved Sodium Chloride Injection. It is supplied as single-use 50 Unit and 100 Unit vials. Dosing of Botox for upper limb spasticity in initial and sequential treatment sessions should be tailored to the individual based on the size, number and location of muscles involved, severity of spasticity, the presence of local muscle weakness, the patient's response to previous treatment, or adverse event history with Botox. The recommended initial doses are as follows:
Biceps Brachii:100 - 200 Units divided in 4 sites
Flexor Carpi Radialis: 12.5 - 50 Units in 1 site
Flexor Carpi Ulnaris: 12.5 - 50 Units in 1 site
Flexor Digitorum Profundus: 30 - 50 Units in 1 site
Flexor Digitorum Sublimis: 30 - 50 Units in 1 site
The recommended dose in children per treatment session is 3 Units per kilogram to 6 Units per kilogram divided among affected muscles of the upper limb. The total dose in pediatric patients should not exceed 8 Units per kilogram body weight or 300 Units, whichever is lower, in a 3-month interval.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The efficacy and safety of Botox for the treatment of upper limb spasticity was evaluated in three randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Efficacy was measured according to the The Ashworth Scale, a clinical measure of the force required to move an extremity around a joint, with a reduction in score clinically representing a reduction in the force needed to move a joint. Possible scores range from 0 (no increase in muscle tone) to 4 (limb rigid in flexion or extension- very severe)
Study One
This trial enrolled 126 patients with upper limb spasticity who were at least 6 months post-stroke. Botox (a total dose of 200 Units to 240 Units) and placebo were injected intramuscularly into the flexor digitorum profundus, flexor digitorum sublimis, flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, and if necessary into the adductor pollcis and flexor pollcis longus. The subjects were followed for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was wrist flexors muscle tone at week 6. The median change from baseline was -2.0 for the Botox arm compared to 0.0 for the placebo arm (pâ‰¤0.05). The median change from baseline in muscle tone for Finger Flexor was -1.0 for the Botox arm and 0.0 for the placebo arm (pâ‰¤0.05). The median change from baseline for thumb flexor muscle tone was -1.0 for both arms.
Study Two
This study compared three doses of Botox (360 Units, 180 Units or 90 Units) with placebo in 91 patients with upper limb spasticity who were at least 6 weeks post-stroke. Botox and placebo were injected into the flexor digitorum profundus, flexor digitorum sublimis, flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, and biceps brachii. The primary efficacy variable in Study 2 was the wrist flexor tone at Week 6. The median change from baseline was -1.5. -1.0. -1.5 for the three Botox arms (90, 180 and 360 Units) respectively and -1.0 for the placebo arm (pâ‰¤0.05). Key secondary endpoints including Physician Global Assessment, finger flexors muscle tone, and elbow flexors muscle tone were also reached.
Study Three
This study compared three doses of Botox (360, 180 or 90 Units) with placebo in 88 patients with upper limb spasticity at least 6 months post-stroke. The primary efficacy variable was wrist and elbow flexor tone. The median change from baseline on the wrist flexor muscle tone was -1.0, -1.0, -1.5 for Botox 90, 180 and 360 Units, respectively and -0.5 for placebo (pâ‰¤0.05 for Botox 360 Units vs. placebo). The median change from baseline for elbow flexor muscle tone was -0.5, -0.5 and -1.0 for the three Botox arms, respectively, and -0.5 for the placebo arm (pâ‰¤0.05 for Botox 360 Units vs. placebo). The key secondary endpoint, mean change in finger flexor tone, was also reached with statistical significance.
The FDA approval of Botox in pediatrics with upper limb spasticity was based on two trials. A placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of onabotulinumtoxinA in children 2 to 16 years of age with upper limb spasticity included 235 patients who were randomized to one intramuscular injection of onabotulinumtoxinA 3 units/kg or 6 units/kg, or placebo. Both active treatment groups demonstrated a significant reduction in Modified Ashworth Scaleâ€�Bohannon scores compared to placebo (onabotulinumtoxinA 6 units/kg, - 1.87; onabotulinumtoxinA 3 units/kg, -1.92; P <.001). The improvement was significant at all assessments during the 12-week trial. An open-label study for upper limb spasticity included 222 subjects. This study focused on safety, with the primary outcome being the percentage of patients reporting at least one adverse event over the course of 60 weeks. The open-label trial for lower limb spasticity followed 350 participants and had the same primary outcome.
","Side Effects
Adverse reactions associated with the use of Botox for upper limb spasticity may include, but are not limited to, the following:
pain in extremity
bronchitis
fatigue
nausea
",,"Mechanism of Action
Botox for injection is a sterile, vacuum-dried purified botulinum toxin type A, produced from fermentation of Hall strain Clostridium botulinum type A. Botox blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to acceptor sites on motor or sympathetic nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. This inhibition occurs as the neurotoxin cleaves SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within nerve endings. When injected intramuscularly at therapeutic doses, Botox produces partial chemical denervation of the muscle resulting in a localized reduction in muscle activity. In addition, the muscle may atrophy, axonal sprouting may occur, and extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors may develop.

Ocaliva (obeticholic acid) is a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist.
Ocaliva is specifically indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA.
Ocaliva is supplied as tablets for oral administration. The recommended starting dosage of Ocaliva is 5 mg orally once daily in adult patients who have not achieved an adequate biochemical response to an appropriate dosage of UDCA for at least 1 year or are intolerant to UDCA. Dosage Titration: If an adequate reduction in ALP and/or total bilirubin has not been achieved after 3 months of Ocaliva 5 mg once daily, and the patient is tolerating Ocaliva, increase the dosage of Ocaliva to 10 mg once daily. The maximum recommended dosage of Ocaliva is 10 mg once daily. Please see drug label for specific dose adjustments.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ocaliva was based on the phase III POISE trial, which studied the safety and efficacy of once-daily treatment with Ocaliva in PBC patients with an inadequate therapeutic response to, or who are unable to tolerate, UDCA. The POISE data showed that Ocaliva, at both a 10 mg dose and a 5 mg dose titrated to 10 mg, met the trial's primary endpoint of achieving a reduction in serum ALP to below a threshold of 1.67 times the upper limit of normal, with a minimum of 15% reduction in ALP level from baseline, and a normal bilirubin level after 12 months of therapy. Pruritus was the most frequently reported adverse event associated with Ocaliva treatment. In a group of patients who initiated Ocaliva at a 5 mg once-daily dose and titrated up to 10 mg once daily, one patient (1%) discontinued from the study due to pruritus as compared to seven patients (10%) in the 10 mg dose group and after 12 months of treatment, efficacy was essentially equivalent to those patients who started the study at the 10 mg dose.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Ocaliva may include, but are not limited to, the following:
pruritus
fatigue
abdominal pain and discomfort
rash
oropharyngeal pain
dizziness
constipation
arthralgia
thyroid function abnormality
eczema
",,"Mechanism of Action
Ocaliva (obeticholic acid) is a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist. FXR is a nuclear receptor expressed in the liver and intestine. FXR is a key regulator of bile acid, inflammatory, fibrotic, and metabolic pathways. FXR activation decreases the intracellular hepatocyte concentrations of bile acids by suppressing de novo synthesis from cholesterol as well as by increased transport of bile acids out of the hepatocytes. These mechanisms limit the overall size of the circulating bile acid pool while promoting choleresis, thus reducing hepatic exposure to bile acids.
"
Liver Disorders,Cholbam (cholic acid),"General Information
Cholbam (cholic acid) is a primary bile acid synthesized from cholesterol in the liver. Patients with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects with peroxisomal disorders (including Zellweger spectrum disorders) lack the enzymes needed to synthesize cholic acid, a primary bile acid normally produced in the liver from cholesterol. The absence of cholic acid in these patients leads to reduced bile flow, accumulation of potentially toxic bile acid intermediates in the liver (cholestasis), and malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins in the diet.
Cholbam is specifically indicated for the treatment of bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects and for the adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders including Zellweger spectrum disorders in patients who exhibit manifestations of liver disease, steatorrhea or complications from decreased fat soluble vitamin absorption. Cholbam is approved for use in children aged three weeks and older, and adults.
Cholbam is supplied as a capsule for oral administration. The recommended dosage is 10 to 15 mg/kg administered orally once daily, or in two divided doses, in pediatric patients and in adults.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Cholbam was based on the following trials:
Bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects:
A single arm trial assessed 50 patients treated over an 18 year period. An extension trial followed 21 of these patients and enrolled an additional 12 patients with interim efficacy data available for an additional 21 months. On average, patients were 4 years of age at the start of cholic acid treatment (range 3 weeks to 36 years). Response to treatment was evaluated by improvements in baseline liver function tests and weight. Responses were noted in 64% of patients with evaluable data. Two-thirds of patients survived greater than three years.
Peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders:
A single arm treatment trial assessed 29 patients treated over an 18 year period. An extension trial followed 10 of these patients and enrolled an additional two patients with interim efficacy data available for 21 additional months. The majority of patients were less than 2 years of age at the start of cholic acid treatment (range 3 weeks to 10 years). Response to treatment was evaluated by improvements in baseline liver function tests and weight. Responses were noted in 46% of patients with evaluable data. Forty-two percent of patients survived greater than 3 years.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Cholbam may include, but are not limited to, the following:
diarrhea
",,"Mechanism of Action
The active ingredient in Cholbam is cholic acid, a primary bile acid synthesized from cholesterol in the liver. In bile acid synthesis disorders due to SEDs in the biosynthetic pathway, and in PDs including Zellweger spectrum disorders, deficiency of primary bile acids leads to unregulated accumulation of intermediate bile acids and cholestasis. Bile acids facilitate fat digestion and absorption by forming mixed micelles, and facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins in the intestine. Endogenous bile acids including cholic acid enhance bile flow and provide the physiologic feedback inhibition of bile acid synthesis. The mechanism of action of cholic acid has not been fully established; however, it is known that cholic acid and its conjugates are endogenous ligands of the nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR). FXR regulates enzymes and transporters that are involved in bile acid synthesis and in the enterohepatic circulation to maintain bile acid homeostasis under normal physiologic conditions.

Vogelxo is a topical gel formulation of testosterone. Endogenous androgens, including testosterone, are responsible for the normal growth and development of the primary and secondary male sexual characteristics.
Vogelxo is specifically indicated for testosterone replacement therapy in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone: primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or acquired).
Vogelxo is supplied as a gel for topical administration. The recommended starting dose for adult males is 50 mg of testosterone (one tube or one packet or 4 pump actuations) applied topically once daily at approximately the same time each day. It should be applied to clean, dry, intact skin of the shoulders and/or upper arms. Do not apply Vogelxo to the genitals or abdomen. If morning pre-dose serum testosterone concentration is below the normal range, increase dose to 100 mg. Pe-dose serum testosterone concentration should be assessed periodically. Patients should wash hands with soap and water immediately after applying Vogelxo and cover application site(s) with clothing after gel has dried.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval was based on a randomized multicenter, multi-dose, active and placebo controlled 90-day study in 406 adult males with morning testosterone levels â‰¤300 ng/dL. The study was double-blind for the doses of testosterone gel and placebo, but open label for the nonÂ­scrotal testosterone transdermal system. During the first 60 days, subjects were evenly randomized to testosterone gel 50 mg, testosterone gel 100 mg, placebo gel, or testosterone transdermal system. At Day 60, subjects receiving testosterone gel were maintained at the same dose, or were titrated up or down within their treatment group, based on 24-hour averaged serum testosterone concentration levels obtained on Day 30. Of 192 hypogonadal men who were appropriately titrated with testosterone gel and who had sufficient data for analysis, 74% achieved an average serum testosterone level within the normal range (300 to 1,000 ng/dL) on treatment Day 90.

Lung Cancer,Abraxane (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension),"General Information
Abraxane (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) is an intravenous nanoparticle, albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel, a cancer chemotherapy, that is protein-stable and Cremophor-free. It was designed to deliver a greater amount of chemotherapy to cancer cells with fewer side effects.
Abraxane is specifically indicated for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in combination with carboplatin, in patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy.
Abraxane is supplied as a solution for intravenous injection. The recommended dose is 100 mg/m2 administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. The recommended dose of carboplatin is AUC = 6 mg min/mL on Day 1 only of each 21-day cycle, beginning immediately after the completion of Abraxane administration.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Abraxane for non-small cell lung cancer was based on a multicenter, randomized, open-label conducted in 1052 chemonaive patients with Stage IIIb/IV non-small cell lung cancer. The trial was designed to compare Abraxane in combination with carboplatin to paclitaxel injection in combination with carboplatin as first-line treatment. Abraxane was administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. Paclitaxel injection was administered as an intravenous infusion over 3 hours at a dose of 200 mg/m2, following premedication. In both treatment arms carboplatin at a dose of AUC = 6 mg min/mL was administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle after completion of Abraxane/paclitaxel infusion. Treatment was administered until disease progression or development of an unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy outcome was overall response rate. Subjects in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm had a statistically significantly higher overall response rate compared to those in the paclitaxel injection/carboplatin arm (33% versus 25%). There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two study arms.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Abraxane when used in combination with carboplatin for non-small cell lung cancer may include, but are not limited to, the following:
anemia
neutropenia
thrombocytopenia
alopecia

",,"Mechanism of Action
Abraxane is a microtubule inhibitor that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. Paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays (or bundles) of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.

Lung Cancer,Hycamtin (topotecan hydrochloride),"General Information
Hycamtin (topotecan) is a semi-synthetic derivative of camptothecin and is an anti-tumor drug with topoisomerase I-inhibitory activity. Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single strand breaks.
Hycamtin is specifically indicated for the treatment of relapsed small cell lung cancer in patients with a prior complete or partial response and who are at least 45 days from the end of first-line chemotherapy.
Hycamtin is supplied as a 0.25 mg and 1 mg capsule designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 2.3 mg/m2/day once daily for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 21 days. The calculated oral daily dose should be rounded to the nearest 0.25 mg, and the minimum number of 1 mg and 0.25 mg capsules should be prescribed. The same number of capsules should be prescribed for each of the 5 dosing days.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
FDA approval of Hycamtin was based on the results of a clinical trial. This randomized, comparative, open label study enrolled 115 subjects who were prior responders (complete or partial) to firstline chemotherapy, were not considered candidates for standard intravenous chemotherapy, and had relapsed at least 45 days from the end of first-line chemotherapy. The subjects received Hycamtin (2.3 mg/m2/day administered for 5 consecutive days repeated every 21 days) and Best Supportive Care (BSC) or BSC alone. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Median survival in the Hycamtin arm was 25.9 weeks (95% CI, 18.3 to 31.6) versus 13.9 weeks (95% CI, 11.1 to 18.6) in the BSC alone arm (log-rank P = .0104).

Thrombocytopenia
Nausea
Vomiting
Diarrhea
",,"Mechanism of Action
Hycamtin (topotecan) is a semi-synthetic derivative of camptothecin and is an anti-tumor drug with topoisomerase I-inhibitory activity. Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single strand breaks. The cytotoxicity of topotecan is thought to be due to double strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis, when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topotecan, topoisomerase I, and DNA. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks.

Lung Cancer,Iressa (gefitinib),"General Information
Iressa is an anticancer drug that inhibits an enzyme (tyrosine kinase) present in lung cancer cells, as well as other cancers and normal tissues, that appears to be important to the growth of cancer cells. It is taken alone, not with other chemotherapy.
The recommended daily dose of Iressa is one 250 mg tablet with or without food. Higher doses do not give a better response and causes increased toxicity.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Iressa was based on a phase III trial. The multicenter clinical trial in the U.S. evaluated the tumor response rate of Iressa 250 and 500 mg/day in 216 subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose disease had progressed after at least two prior chemotherapy regimens including a platinum drug and docetaxel. Iressa was taken once daily at approximately the same time each day. Subjects received Iressa, 102 (47%) and 114 (53%) receiving 250 mg and 500 mg daily doses, respectively. In addition, 41% of the subjects had received two prior treatment regimens, 33% three prior treatment regimens, and 25% four or more prior treatment regimens.
Results showed that the overall response rate for the 250 and 500 mg doses combined was 10.6% (95% CI: 6%, 16.8%). Response rates appeared to be highly variable in subgroups of the treated population: 5.1% (4/79) in males, 17.5% (11/63) in females, 4.6% (5/108) in previous or current smokers, 29.4% (10/34) in nonsmokers, 12.4% (12/97) with adenocarcinoma histology, and 6.7% (3/45) with other NSCLC histologies. Similar differences in response were seen in a multinational study in subjects who had received 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens, at least l of which was platinum-based. In responders, the median time from diagnosis to study randomization was 16.7 months (range 8 to 34 months).

",,"Mechanism of Action
Gefitinib is an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It works by binding to the intracellular enzyme (tyrosine kinase) of the EGFR to directly block signals turned on by triggers outside or inside the cell.
The activity of epidermal growth factor and its receptor, the EGFR, have been identified as key drivers in the process of cell growth and replication. Heightened activity at the EGF receptor, whether caused by an increase in the concentration of ligand around the cell, an increase in receptor numbers or a decrease in receptor turnover or receptor mutation, can lead to an increase in the drive for the cell to replicate. There is now a body of evidence to show that the EGFR-mediated drive is increased in a wide variety of solid tumours, including non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer and tumours of the head and neck.
Gefitinib is an anilinoquinazoline with the chemical name 4-Quinazolinamine. The mechanism of the clinical antitumor action of gefitinib is not fully characterized. Gefitinib inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of numerous tyrosine kinases associated with transmembrane cell surface receptors, including the tyrosine kinases associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TK). EGFR is expressed on the cell surface of many normal cells and cancer cells. No clinical studies have been performed that demonstrate a correlation between EGFR receptor expression and response to gefitinib.

Lung Cancer,Keytruda (pembrolizumab),"General Information
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) targets the cellular pathway known as PD-1/PD-L1, proteins found on the bodyâ€™s immune cells and some cancer cells. By blocking this pathway, Keytruda may help the bodyâ€™s immune system fight the cancer cells.
Keytruda is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an FDA-approved test with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving Keytruda.
Keyruda is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion. The recommended dose of Keytruda is 2 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Keytruda for non-small cell lung cancer was based on a subgroup of 61 patients enrolled within a larger multicenter, open-label, multi-part study. The subgroup consisted of patients with advanced NSCLC that progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy or, if appropriate, targeted therapy for certain genetic mutations (ALK or EGFR). This subgroup also had PD-L1 positive tumors based on the results of the 22C3 pharmDx diagnostic test. Study subjects received 10 mg/kg of Keytruda every two or three weeks. The major outcome measure was overall response rate (percentage of subjects who experienced complete and partial shrinkage of their tumors). Tumors shrank in 41 percent of subjects treated with Keytruda and the effect lasted between 2.1 and 9.1 months.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Keytruda may include, but are not limited to, the following:
fatigue
decreased appetite
shortness of breath or impaired breathing (dyspnea)
cough
Keytruda also has the potential to cause severe side effects that result from the immune system effect of Keytruda (known as â€œimmune-mediated side effectsâ€�).
",,"Mechanism of Action
Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response.

Lung Cancer,Portrazza (necitumumab),"General Information
Portrazza (necitumumab) is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist.
Portrazza is specifically indicated for use in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin, for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
Portrazza is supplied as a solution for intravenous administration. The recommended dose is 800 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle prior to gemcitabine and cisplatin infusion. Continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Please see drug label for specific dose modifications.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Portrazza was based on SQUIRE ,an open-label, randomized, multi-center Phase III trial that compared first-line treatment with Portrazza in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin to treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in 1,093 patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC. Patients on both arms of the study were allowed to receive a maximum of six cycles of chemotherapy. Patients on the Portrazza arm demonstrating at least stable disease continued to receive additional cycles of Portrazza until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Results showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival over gemcitabine and cisplatin alone, specifically in the first-line setting. Portrazza combination therapy showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, the main outcome measure (p=0.01), with a median overall survival of 11.5 months for the Portrazza arm, as compared to 9.9 months for those treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone. This translated to a 16 percent reduction in risk of death. The percentage of deaths at the time of analysis was 77% on the Portrazza arm and 81% on the control arm. The significant survival improvement observed in SQUIRE was supported by a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (p=0.02), with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.7 months on the Portrazza arm, as compared to 5.5 months for those treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone. The percentage of events at the time of analysis was 79% on the Portrazza arm and 76% on the control arm. Overall response rate (ORR) was also assessed and there was no difference between arms, with an ORR of 31% for the Portrazza plus gemcitabine and cisplatin arm and an ORR of 29% for the gemcitabine and cisplatin arm (p=0.40).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Portrazza may include, but are not limited to, the following:

hypomagnesemia
Portrazza comes with a boxed warning regarding the risk of cardiopulmonary arrest and hypomagnesemia.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Portrazza (necitumumab) is a recombinant human lgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and blocks the binding of EGFR to its ligands. Expression and activation of EGFR has been correlated with malignant progression, induction of angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis. Binding of necitumumab induces EGFR internalization and degradation in vitro. In vitro, binding of necitumumab also led to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in EGFR-expressing cells.

Lung Cancer,"Tarceva (erlotinib, OSI 774)","General Information
Tarceva (erlotinib) is a Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Type 1/Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER1/EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. While the complete mechanism of action is not entirely understood, the drug appears to impede cell-cell singlaling pathways which have been implicated in rapid cell division and survival. Overactivation of these pathways are thought to be central to tumor growth and metastasis.
It is specifically indicated as monotherapy to treat non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have failed to respond or has ceased responding to at least one round of chemotherapy. It is not indicated as a first-line therapy: results from two, multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase 3 trials conducted in first-line patients showed no clinical benefit with the concurrent administration of Tarceva with platinum-based chemotherapy regimens..
Tarceva is administered as an oral tablet, with a recommended dosage of 150 mg once daily at least one hour before or two hours after eating. Patients experiencing significant adverse reactions should reduce dosage as appropriate in 50 mg decrements.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Tarceva was a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies enrolling a combined total of 731 subjects with confirmed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one chemotherapy regimen. The trial randomized subjects at a 2:1 ratio to receive Tarceva (n=488) or placebo (n=243) orally once daily until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the intent to treat population, Tarceva was found to significantly improve 1-year survival time, progression free tumor response and response duration, and medain overall response duration. In subsets of patients with EGFR positive tumors and patients who never smoked, the drug appeared to carry improved efficacy.
Results from two, multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, trials in over 1000 patients investigating the drug as an first-line adjuvant to standard platinum based chemotherapy regimens (carboplatin and paclitaxel or gemcitabine and cisplatin) indicated that patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC showed no clinical benefit in terms of tumor response or survival benefit with the concurrent administration of TARCEVA, versus chemotherapy alone.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Tarceva may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Rash
Diarrhea
Anorexia
Stomatitis
Pruritus
Infection
In addition to these events, infrequent serious Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) has been observed, including fatalities. ILD incidence in the trial which formed the basis of FDA approval was the same for both placebo and Tarceva groups (0.8% of patients). Most cases were associated with confounding or contributing factors. Tarceva use should be suspended pending evaluation on the appearance of new pulomary symptoms, and discontinued upon diagnosis of ILD.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Tarceva (erlotinib) is a Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Type 1/Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER1/EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. While the complete mechanism of action is not entirely understood, the HER1 and EGFR receptors are directly involved in inter-cellular signalling in systems governing cell division and prolifferation. By inhibiting the function of these receptors, which are highly active and often over-expressed in rapidly dividng tumor cells, Tarceva is thought to limit tumor cells' ability to divide and metastasize, and may help to initiate pathways of apoptotic cell death.

",,"Mechanism of Action
Pretomanid is a nitroimidazooxazine antimycobacterial drug. Pretomanid kills actively replicating M. tuberculosis by inhibiting mycolic acid biosynthesis, thereby blocking cell wall production. Under anaerobic conditions, against non-replicating bacteria, pretomanid acts as a respiratory poison following nitric oxide release. All of these activities require nitro-reduction of pretomanid within the mycobacterial cell by the deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase, Ddn, which is dependent on the reduced form of the cofactor F420. Reduction of F420 is accomplished by the F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Lupus,Benlysta (belimumab),"General Information
Benlysta (belimumab) is a human IgG 1 Ã€ monoclonal antibody specific for soluble human B lymphocyte stimulator protein (BLyS). Elevated levels of BLyS are seen in the blood or joint fluid of patients with autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.
Benlysta is specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive, systemic lupus erythematosus who are receiving standard therapy. Benlysta intravenous (IV) infusion is also indicated for use in pediatrics 5 years of age and older with systemic lupus erythematosus.
Benlysta is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion. It must be reconstituted and diluted prior to intravenous administration The recommended initial dose is 10 mg/kg at 2-week intervals for the first 3 doses and at 4-week intervals thereafter. It should be administered as an intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops an infusion reaction.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Benlysta was based on three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies involving 2,133 patients with SLE.
Trial 1: Benlysta 1 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg
Trial 1 enrolled 449 subjects and evaluated doses of 1, 4, and 10 mg/kg Benlysta plus standard of care compared with placebo plus standard of care over 52 weeks. The co-primary endpoints were percent change in SELENA-SLEDAI score at Week 24 and time to first flare over 52 weeks. No significant differences between any of the Benlysta groups and the placebo group were observed. Exploratory analysis of this study identified a subgroup of subjects (72%), who were autoantibody positive, in whom Benlysta appeared to offer benefit. The results of this study informed the design of Trials 2 and 3 and led to the selection of a target population and indication that is limited to autoantibody-positive SLE patients.
Trials 2 and 3: Benlysta 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg
Trials 2 and 3 were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with SLE that were similar in design except - Trial 2 was 76 weeks duration and was conducted in North America and Europe.and Trial 3 was 52 weeks duration and was conducted in South America, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Australia. At screening, subjects were stratified by disease severity based on their SELENA-SLEDAI score, proteinuria level and race (African or Indigenous-American descent vs. other), and then randomly assigned to receive Benlysta 1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or placebo in addition to standard of care. Treatment was administered intravenously over a 1-hour period on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days for 48 weeks in Trial 3 and for 72 weeks in Trial 2. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite endpoint (SLE Responder Index or SRI) that defined response as meeting each of the following criteria at Week 52 compared with baseline:
â‰¥4-point reduction in the SELENA-SLEDAI score, and
no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A organ domain score or 2 new BILAG B organ domain scores, and
no worsening (<0.30-point increase) in Physicianâ€™s Global Assessment (PGA) score
In both Trials 2 and 3, the proportion of SLE patients achieving an SRI response, as defined for the primary endpoint, was significantly higher in the Benlysta 10 mg/kg group than in the placebo group. The trends in comparisons between the treatment groups for the rates of response for the individual components of the endpoint were generally consistent with that of the SRI. At Week 76 in Trial 2, the SRI response rate with Benlysta 10 mg/kg was not significantly different from that of placebo (39% and 32%, respectively).
The efficacy of Benlysta IV for the treatment of SLE in pediatric patients was studied over 52 weeks in 93 pediatric patients with SLE. The proportion of pediatric patients achieving the composite primary endpoint, the SLE response index (SRI-4), was higher in pediatric patients receiving Benlysta IV plus standard therapy compared to placebo plus standard therapy. Pediatric patients who received Benlysta IV plus standard therapy also had a lower risk of experiencing a severe flare, as well as longer duration of time until a severe flare (160 days versus 82 days). The drug's safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in pediatric patients were consistent with those in adults with SLE.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Benlysta may include, but are not limited to, the following:
nausea
diarrhea
pyrexia
nasopharyngitis
bronchitis
insomnia
pain in extremity
depression
migraine
pharyngitis
",,"Mechanism of Action
Benlysta (belimumab) is a human IgG 1 Ã€ monoclonal antibody specific for soluble human B lymphocyte stimulator protein (BLyS). It blocks the binding of soluble BLyS, a B-cell survival factor, to its receptors on B cells. Benlysta does not bind B cells directly, but by binding BLyS, it inhibits the survival of B cells, including auto reactive B cells, and reduces the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells.

Acute lymphocytic leukemia,Arranon (nelarabine),"General Information
Arranon (nelarabine) is a cytotoxic deoxyguanosine analogue prodrug. The drug disrupts DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, inducing cellular apoptosis. Additional mechanisms of cytotoxic activity may also exist.
Arranon is specifically indicated for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma whose disease has not responded to or has relapsed following treatment with at least two chemotherapy regimens.
Arranon is supplied as a clear, colorless, sterile solution designed for intravenous infusion. Recommended adult dosage is 1,500 mg/m2 delivered as a 2 hour infusion on days 1, 3, and 5 of a 21 day treatment cycle. Recommended pediatric dosage is 650 mg/m2 delivered as a 1 hour infusion daily for days 1 through 5 of a 21 day treatment cycle. Treatment cycles should be repeated until evidence of disease progression is observed.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Approval of Arranon was supported by a pair of clinical trials, investigating the drug in both pediatric and adult patients.
Pediatric Patients
Arranon was investigated in a phase II trial of pediatric patients age 21 years and younger. This single-arm, multi-center enrolled 84 patients with refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL); 31 of these subjects had received one prior chemotherapy regimen, and 39 had received two or more. All patients received 650 mg/m2 via one hour infusion for 5 consecutive days in 21 day treatment cycles. Results indicated that 13% of subjects (n=5) achieved complete disease response (bone marrow blast counts<5%) and full recovery of peripheral blood counts, and 10% (n=4) achieved complete disease response without full hematological recovery. Response duration was 3.3 to 9.3 weeks, and median overall survival was 13.1 weeks.
Adult Patients
The drug's safety and efficacy in adult patients was investigated was investigated in an additional phase II study. This single-arm, multi-center study enrolled 39 T-ALL and T-LBL patients, 28 of whom had received at least two courses of chemotherapy. Among these subjects, 18% (n=5) achieved complete response and hematological recovery, and 4% (n=1). Duration of complete response was 4 to 195+ weeks, and median overall survival was 20.6 weeks.

Acute lymphocytic leukemia,Asparlas (calaspargase pegol-mknl ),"General Information
Asparlas is an asparagine specific enzyme.
Asparlas is specifically indicated as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in pediatric and young adult patients age 1 month to 21 years.
Asparlas is supplied as an injection for intravenous administration. The recommended dosage is 2,500 units/m2 intravenously no more frequently than every 21 days.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Asparlas was based on a demonstration of the achievement and maintenance of nadir serum asparaginase activity (NSAA) above the level of 0.1 U/mL using Asparlas 2500 U/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. The pharmacokinetics of Asparlas were studied when used in combination with multiagent chemotherapy in 124 patients with B cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The results showed that 123 (99%) of the 124 patients maintained NSAA > 0.1 U/mL at weeks 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Asparlas may include, but are not limited to, the following:
elevated transaminase
increased bilirubin
pancreatitis
abnormal clotting
",,"Mechanism of Action
Asparlas is an asparagine specific enzyme. L-asparaginase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the amino acid L-asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia. The pharmacological effect of Asparlas is thought to be based on selective killing of leukemic cells due to depletion of plasma L-asparagine. Leukemic cells with low expression of asparagine synthetase have a reduced ability to synthesize L-asparagine, and therefore depend on an exogenous source of L-asparagine for survival.

Acute lymphocytic leukemia,Clolar (clofarabine),"General Information
Clolar (clofarabine) is an anti-neoplastic purine nucleoside analog used to treat lymphoblastic leukemia . The drug acts as an anti-metabolite, interfering with DNA replication. In addition, the drug appears to disrupt the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane, releasing pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor, activating pathways of programmed cell death. In these ways Clolar exerts a cytotoxic effect on both rapidly dividing and quiescent cancer cells.
Clolar is specifically indicated to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in pediatric patients ages 1-21, whose disease has relapsed or beecome refractory after at least two prior treatment regimens.
Clolar is administered as an intravenously, with a recommended dosage of 52 mg/m2 via 2-hour infusion dialy for 5 days, with cycle repeats every 2-6 weeks once organ function has returned to baseline.
Clinical Results
FDA approval of Clolar was based on a pair of clinical trials, involving a total of 66 pediatric ALL patients. The first was a open-label, dose-escalation, noncomparative study, which enrolled a total of 17 pediatric ALL patients . Subjects received escalating doses of the drug ranging from 11.25 mg/m2 to 70 mg/m2, daily for 5 days. 9 of the 17 received the recommended dose of 52 mg/m2. Among all patients 2 complete and 2 patial responses were observed. Dose limiting toxicities, including reversible hyperbilirubinemia and elevated transaminase levels and skin rash, were observed at 70 mg/m2, leading to the choice of 52 mg/m2 as the optimum dose.
The second study was a single arm, open label study which enrolled 49 pediatric ALL patients. Subjects in this study received up to sequential cycles at the recommended dose (52 mg/m2 x 5 days), with no dose escalation. Efficacy was observed in the trial's primary endpoint, the overall rate of response. Specifically, there were 6 completer responses (CR; 12.2%), 4 complete responses which did not also demonstrate platelet recovery (CRp; 8.2%), and 5 partial responses (PR; 10.2%), for a total response rate of 30.6%. Among the 9 responding patients who did not undergo bone marrow transplant following treatment, response durations were as follows: 43, 50, 82, 93+ and 160+ days for CR subjects, 32 days for one CRp subject, and 7, 16, and 21 days for PR subjects.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Clolar may include (but are not limited to) the following:
Febrile neutropenia
Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)
Vomiting
Nausea
Diarrhea
Pyrexia
Rigors
Abdominal Pain
Fatigue
Tachycardia
Anorexia Additionally, animal models have demostrated teratogenic potential in pregnant women. Human embryo toxicity has not been investigated, but the likelyhood of risk to the fetus is very high, and pregnancy should be avoided while receiving Clolar.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Clolar disrupts DNA synthesis and causes fatal replication errors through the disruption of several intracellular syntetic pathways. Specifically, the drug depletes deoxynucleotide triphosphate pools through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, and causes termination of DNA chain elongation through incorporation into the DNA strand and competitive inhibition of DNA polymerases. Furthermore, the drug has been shown to disrupt mitochondrial membrane intergrity, possibly through disruption of mitochondrial DNA synthesis. Disruption of mitochondrial integrity leads to the release of the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor, which activate programmed cell death pathways.

Iclusig (ponatinib) is a small-molecule dual Abl/Src protein inhibitor.
Iclusig is specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) that is resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy or Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) that is resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.
Iclusig is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is 45 mg administered orally once daily. Treatment should be continued until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dose modifications should be considered for myelosuppression, non-hematologic adverse reactions, and use with strong CYP3A inhibitors. See drug label for appropriate dose modifications.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Iclusig was based on a single-arm, open-label, international, multicenter trial in 449 subjects with CML and Ph+ALL whose disease was considered to be resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Subjects were assigned to one of six cohorts based on disease phase (chronic phase CML [CP-CML]; accelerated phase CML [AP-CML]; or blast phase CML [BP-CML]/Ph+ALL), resistance or intolerance (R/I) to prior TKI therapy, and the presence of the T315I mutation. All subjects were administered a starting dose of 45 mg of Iclusig once daily. 444 subjects eligible for efficacy analysis: 267 subjects with CP-CML (R/I Cohort: n=203, T315I: n=64), 83 with AP-CML, 62 subjects with BP-CML, and 32 with Ph+ALL. Five subjects were not eligible for efficacy analysis due to lack of confirmation of T315I mutation status. The primary efficacy endpoint in CP-CML was major cytogenetic response (MCyR), which included complete and partial cytogenetic responses (CCyR and PCyR); this was reached by 54% of the population. The median time to MCyR was 84 days. At the time of analysis, the median durations of MCyR had not yet been reached. The primary efficacy endpoint in AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ALL was major hematologic response (MaHR), defined as either a complete hematologic response (CHR) or no evidence of leukemia (NEL); this was reached by 52% of the AP-CML population, 31% of the BP-CML population and 41% of the Ph+ ALL population. The median time to MaHR in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ALL was 21 days, 29 days and 20 days, respectively. The median duration of MaHR for patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ALL was 9.5 months, 4.7 months and 3.2 months, respectively.

"Lymphocytic Leukemia, Chronic",Rituxan (rituximab),"General Information
Rituxan is a CD20-directed cytolytic antibody.
Rituxan is specifically indicated for use in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC), for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated and previously treated CD20-positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Rituxan is supplied as an injection for intravenous administration. The recommended dose of Rituxan for CLL is 375 mg/m2 the day prior to the initiation of FC chemotherapy, then 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of cycles 2-6 (every 28 days).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Rituxan for CLL was based on two phase III studies. In the CLL8 study of 817 previously untreated patients, the addition of rituximab to FC yielded a 79% improvement in progression-free survival. The duration of progression-free survival was extended by more than 8 months compared with FC alone (39.8 months vs 31.5 months). In the REACH study of 552 rituximab-naive patients with relapsed CLL, the use of rituximab plus FC yielded a 32% improvement in progression-free survival. Progression-free survival was 5 months longer for the combination therapy compared with FC alone (26.7 months vs 21.7 months).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Rituxan for CLL may include, but are not limited to, the following:
infusion-related reactions
neutropenia
The Rituxan drug label comes with the following Black Box Warning:
Infusion-Related Reactions: Rituxan administration can result in serious, including fatal, infusion-related reactions. Deaths within 24 hours of Rituxan infusion have occurred. Approximately 80% of fatal infusion reactions occurred in association with the first infusion. Monitor patients closely. Discontinue Rituxan infusion for severe reactions and provide medical treatment for Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions. Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions Severe, including fatal, mucocutaneous reactions can occur in patients receiving Rituxan. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation: HBV reactivation can occur in patients treated with Rituxan, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Screen all patients for HBV infection before treatment initiation, and monitor patients during and after treatment with Rituxan. Discontinue Rituxan and concomitant medications in the event of HBV reactivation. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal PML, can occur in patients receiving Rituxan.
",,"Mechanism of Action
Rituxan (rituximab) is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen expressed on the surface of pre-B and mature B-lymphocytes. Upon binding to CD20, rituximab mediates B-cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). B cells are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associated chronic synovitis. In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokine production.

",,"Mechanism of Action
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD 1)-blocking, humanized monoclonal IgG4 kappa antibody. Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response.

Lymphoma,Opdivo (nivolumab),"General Information
Opdivo (nivolumab) targets the cellular pathway known as PD-1/PD-L1, proteins found on the bodyâ€™s immune cells and some cancer cells. By blocking this pathway, Opdivo may help the bodyâ€™s immune system fight cancer cells.
Opdivo is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has relapsed or progressed after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and post-transplantation brentuximab vedotin.
Opdivo is supplied as a solution for intravenous administration. The recommended dose is 3 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Opdivo for classic Hodgkin's lymphoma was based on two single-arm, multicenter trials of nivolumab in adults with relapsed or refractory cHL. The trials enrolled patients regardless of PD-L1 expression status on Reed-Sternberg cells. The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) as determined by an independent radiographic review committee. Additional outcome measures included duration of response (DOR). Efficacy was evaluated in 95 patients previously treated with autologous HSCT and post-transplantation brentuximab vedotin. Patients had a median of 5 prior systemic regimens and received a median of 17 doses of nivolumab. Single-agent nivolumab produced a 65% ORR, with 58% partial remission and 7% complete remission. The median time-to-response was 2.1 months. The estimated median DOR was 8.7 months.

Lymphoma,Revlimid (lenalidomide),"General Information
Revlimid (lenalidomide) is an orally available thalidomide analog, exerting both anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory properties.
Revlimid is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
Revlimid is supplied as an opaque capsule for oral administration. Recommended dosing is 10 mg daily with water. Dosing may be reduced (to 5 mg once daily or once every other day) or temporarily suspended if incidence of thrombocytopenia or neutropenia is observed (see ","Side Effects, below).
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Approval of Revlimid was based on results of an open-label, single arm, multi-center study that enrolled 148 patients with red-blood-cell-transfusion dependent anemia due to low-or intermediate-1- risk MDS associated with a 5 q (q31-33) cytogenetic abnormality in isolation or with additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Subjects received 10 mg Revlimid once daily either continuously or for 21 of every 28 days. Sequential dose reductions, to 5 mg daily and 5 mg every other day, were permitted to mitigate toxicities. The drug was shown to be efficacious in reducing the need for red-blood cell transfusions: 67% (n=99/148) of patients experienced a period of at least 8 weeks during which no transfusion was needed, and the median duration of transfusion independence was maintained for a median 44 weeks. 90% of responders experienced onset of transfusion independence within 3 months. Dose interruption or reduction due to toxicity was necessary in 79.7% of patients (n=118/148).
Ongoing Study Commitments
The embryo-fetal toxicity assessment of Revlimid has not been adequately addressed. Celgene has agreed to provide adequate information for this assessment in appropriate models designed to fully assess the possible toxicity of Revlimid. Celgene plans to conduct these studies in two different species that are appropriate to assess the full range of thalidomide embryo-fetal effects. As discussed, the rat is not an acceptable model. If the study with lenalidomide in the first species shows clear evidence of teratogenesis, than a confirmatory study will not be necessary. Although not generally considered definitive test systems for pharmaceutical products, additional studies of an exploratory nature on the embryo-fetal effects of lenalidomide may be useful.
Protocol Submission: June 2006
Study Start: September 2006
Final Report Submission: December 2007
Celgene has agreed to submit the study report and data from the ongoing study, CC-5013-MDS-004, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 3-arm study of the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of lenalidomide (5 mg daily versus 10 mg day 21 days of a 28 day cycle) versus placebo in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent patients with low-or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality when completed.
Protocol Submission: March 2005
Study Start: August 2005
Final Report Submission: December 2008
Following Revlimid dosing, approximately 2/3 of lenalidomide is excreted as unchanged drug in urine. In multiple myeloma patients with mild renal impairment, exposure (plasma AUC) was 56% higher than in similar patients with normal renal function who received the same dose. Based on these data, Celgene has agreed to conduct a study to determine the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide in subjects with renal impairment.

The exact mechanism of Revlimid's activity has not been fully detailed. In-vitro and in-vivo studies indicated that the drug both inhibited the secretion of pro inflammatory cytokines and promoted the secretion of anti inflammatory cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The drug also inhibited expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) but not COX-1 in vitro. Additional antiproliferative activity was noted in some, but not all, human cell lines. The drug effectively inhibited growth of Namalwa cells, a human B cell lymphoma cell line with a deletion of one chromosome 5, but was much less effective in inhibiting the KG-1 human myeloblastic cell line (which also has a deletion of one chromosome 5), and other cell lines without chromosome 5 deletions.

Zydelig (idelalisib) is a small molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) delta, an intracellular signaling component. PI3K-delta is expressed primarily in blood-cell lineages, including cells that cause or mediate hematologic malignancies.
Zydelig is specifically indicated for the following:
Relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia in combination with rituximab, in patients for whom rituximab alone would be considered appropriate therapy due to other co-morbidities.
Relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.
Relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma in patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies
Zydelig is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended maximum starting dose of Zydelig is 150 mg administered orally twice daily. Zydelig can be taken with or without food. Tablets should be swallowed whole. Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
Zydelig was granted regular approval for use in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Accelerated approval was granted for relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (FL) and relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) based on overall response rate. Improvement in patient survival or disease related symptoms has not been established. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
Relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia
Zydelig was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 1) in 220 subjects with relapsed CLL who required treatment and were unable to tolerate standard chemoimmunotherapy. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive 8 doses of rituximab (first dose at 375 mg/m2, subsequent doses at 500 mg/m2 every 2 weeks for 4 infusions and every 4 weeks for an additional 4 infusions) in combination with either an oral placebo twice daily or with Zydelig 150 mg taken twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). The subjects who received Zydelig in combination with rituximab went approximately 11 months without disease pregression, compared to approximately 6 months for subjects given rituximab and a placebo (p < 0.0001).
Relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
A single-arm, multicenter clinical trial enrolled 72 subjects with follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had relapsed within 6 months following rituximab and an alkylating agent and had received at least 2 prior treatments. Subjects received 150 mg of Zydelig orally twice daily until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was Independent Review Committee-assessed overall response rate. Zydelig achieved an overall response rate of 54%; 8% were complete responses and 46% were partial responses. The median duration of response was not reached.
Relapsed Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma

Sylvant (siltuximab) is an anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to human IL-6.1 IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine produced by various cells such as T cells, B cells, monocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Dysregulated overproduction of IL-6 from activated B cells in affected lymph nodes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of, or mechanism causing, multicentric Castleman's disease.
Sylvant is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castlemanâ€™s disease who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative.
Sylvant is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion. The recommended dose is 11 mg/kg is given over 1 hour as an intravenous infusion administered every three weeks until treatment failure.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Sylvant was based on a phase II, multinational, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. In this study 53 subjectswere randomized to Best Supportive Care (BSC) and Sylvant at a dose of 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks and 26 subjects were randomized to BSC and placebo. Treatment was continued until treatment failure (defined as disease progression based on increase in symptoms, radiologic progression or deterioration in performance status) or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome of the study was durable tumor and symptomatic response, defined as tumor response assessed by independent review and complete resolution or stabilization of MCD symptoms. A durable response was defined as tumor and symptomatic response that persisted for a minimum of 18 weeks without treatment failure. The durable tumor and symptomatic response in the Sylvant arm was 34% compared to 0% in the placebo arm (p=0.0012).

Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency (LAL),Kanuma (sebelipase alfa),"General Information
Kanuma (sebelipase alfa) is a hydrolytic lysosomal cholesteryl ester and triacylglycerol-specific enzyme.
Kanuma is specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with a diagnosis of Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) deficiency.
Kanuma is supplied as a solution for intravenous infusion. The recommended dose is as follows:
Patients with Rapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency Presenting within the First 6 Months of Life: The recommended starting dosage is 1 mg/kg administered once weekly as an intravenous infusion. For patients who do not achieve an optimal clinical response, increase to 3 mg/kg once weekly.
Pediatric and Adult Patients with LAL Deficiency: The recommended dosage is 1 mg/kg administered once every other week as an intravenous infusion.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Kanuma was based on the following studies:
Patients with Rapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency Presenting within the First 6 Months of Life:
A multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical study of Kanuma was conducted in 9 infants with LAL deficiency who had growth failure or other evidence of rapidly progressive disease prior to 6 months of age. The age range at entry was 1 to 6 months. Patients received Kanuma at 0.35 mg/kg once weekly for the first 2 weeks and then 1 mg/kg once weekly. Due to suboptimal clinical response, doses in all 6 surviving patients were escalated to 3 mg/kg once weekly, between 4 and 88 weeks (median 11 weeks) after starting treatment at 1 mg/kg. In one patient, the dose was escalated to 5 mg/kg once weekly at Week 88 due to decreased growth velocity in a setting of positive neutralizing anti-drug antibodies to Kanuma. The recommended dosage for these patients is 1 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg once weekly. Efficacy of Kanuma was assessed by comparing the survival of 9 Kanuma-treated patients at 12 months of age with an untreated historical cohort of 21 patients with a similar age at disease presentation and clinical characteristics. Of the 9 Kanuma-treated infants, 6 patients survived beyond 12 months of age, compared to 0 of 21 patients in the historical cohort, all of whom died by 8 months of age. The median age of the 6 surviving Kanuma-treated patients was 18.1 months (range 12 to 42.2 months). Following initiation of treatment with Kanuma 1 mg/kg once weekly, weight-for-age z-scores improved in 3 of 5 surviving patients with growth failure, and all 6 surviving patients demonstrated improvements in weight-for-age z-scores following dose escalation to 3 mg/kg once weekly.
Pediatric and Adult Patients with LAL Deficiency:
The safety and efficacy of Kanuma were assessed in 66 pediatric and adult patients with LAL deficiency, aged 4 to 58 years (71% were less than 18 years old), in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized to receive Kanuma at a dosage of 1 mg/kg (n=36) or placebo (n=30) once every other week for 20 weeks in the double-blind period. Sixty-two of the 66 (94%) patients had LDL-c of 130 mg/dL or greater at study entry. The majority of patients (58%) had LDL-c above 190 mg/dL at study entry, and 24% of patients with LDL-c above 190 mg/dL remained on lipid lowering medications. At the completion of the 20-week double-blind period of the trial, a statistically significant improvement in percent change from baseline in LDL-c was observed in the Kanuma-treated group as compared to the placebo group (p<0.0001). LDL-c of less than 130 mg/dL was achieved in 13 of 32 Kanuma-treated patients and in only 2 of 30 placebo-treated patients with baseline LDL-c of 130 mg/dL or greater. A statistically significant improvement in percent change from baseline at 20 weeks was also observed in the Kanuma-treated group compared to the placebo group for other parameters related to LAL deficiency, including decreases in non-HDL-c (p<0.0001) and triglycerides (p=0.0375), and increases in HDL-c (p<0.0001). The effect of Kanuma on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been established.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Kanuma or LAL deficiency, please visit http://kanuma.com/""Kaposi's Sarcoma","Mechanism of Action
Kanuma (sebelipase alfa) is a hydrolytic lysosomal cholesteryl ester and triacylglycerol-specific enzyme. LAL deficiency is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by a genetic defect resulting in a marked decrease or loss in activity of the lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) enzyme. The primary site of action of the LAL enzyme is the lysosome, where the enzyme normally causes the breakdown of lipid particles including LDL-c. Deficient LAL enzyme activity results in progressive complications due to the lysosomal accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in multiple organs, including the liver, spleen, intestine, and the walls of blood vessels. The resulting lipid accumulation in the liver may lead to increased liver fat content and progression of liver disease, including fibrosis and cirrhosis. Lipid accumulation in the intestinal wall leads to malabsorption and growth failure. In parallel, dyslipidemia due to impaired degradation of lysosomal lipid is common with elevated LDL-c and triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c). Sebelipase alfa binds to cell surface receptors via glycans expressed on the protein and is subsequently internalized into lysosomes. Sebelipase alfa catalyzes the lysosomal hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides to free cholesterol, glycerol and free fatty acids.

Actinic keratosis,Ameluz (aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride),"General Information
Ameluz (aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride) is a porphyrin precursor.
Ameluz is specifically indicated in combination with photodynamic therapy (PDT) using BF-RhodoLED lamp, a narrowband, red light illumination source, for lesion-directed and field-directed treatment of actinic keratoses (AKs) of mild-to-moderate severity on the face and scalp.
Ameluz is supplied as a gel for topical administration. Treat single lesions or an entire field affected by multiple lesions with Ameluz, in combination with red light photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT requires administration of both Ameluz and BF-RhodoLED light. Retreat lesions that have not completely resolved after 3 months after the initial treatment. Refer to BF-RhodoLED user manual for detailed lamp safety and operating instructions.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ameluz in combination with PDT using a narrow spectrum (red light lamp) source was based on three randomized, multicenter trials (Trials 1, 2, and 3). Trials 2 and 3 were vehicle-controlled and double-blind. Trial 1 was double-blind with respect to vehicle and observer-blind regarding the active comparator arm. All clinical trials included a follow-up assessment after 6 and 12 months. In these trials, 212 subjects with 4 to 8 mild to moderate AK lesions on the face/forehead and/or bald scalp were treated with Ameluz and a narrow band spectrum lamp. In all trials, the lesions that were not completely cleared 12 weeks after the initial treatment were treated a second time with an identical regimen. In the trials, 42% (88/212) of subjects needed a second treatment. The primary endpoint for all trials was complete clearance 12 weeks after the last PDT. Trial 1: 85% versus 13% for placebo; Trial 2: 84% versus 3% and Trial 3: 91% versus 22% for placebo.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Ameluz may include, but are not limited to, the following:
erythema
pain/burning
irritation
edema
pruritus
exfoliation
scab
induration
vesicles
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Ameluz or actinic keratoses, please visit http://biofrontera.com/","Mechanism of Action
Ameluz (aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride) is a porphyrin precursor. Photoactivation following topical application of Ameluz occurs when aminolevulinic acid (prodrug) is metabolized to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a photoactive compound which accumulates in the skin. When exposed to red light of a suitable wavelength and energy, PpIX is activated resulting in an excited state of porphyrin molecules. In the presence of oxygen, reactive oxygen species are formed which causes damage to cellular components, and eventually destroys the cells. Ameluz photodynamic therapy of AK lesions utilizes photoactivation of topically applied Ameluz resulting from BF-RhodoLED illumination, which provides a red light of narrow spectrum and a light dose of approximately 37 J/cm2.

Actinic keratosis,Zyclara (imiquimod),"General Information
Zyclara contains the active ingredient imiquimod, which belongs to a class of drugs called immune response modifiers (IRM's). IRM's have shown both antitumor and antiviral activity in vivo. The exact mechanism of action in which imiquimod activates the immune system is not yet known. However, it is known that imiquimod activates immune cells through the toll-like receptor 7, commonly involved in pathogen recognition, on the cell surface.
Zyclara is specifically approved for the topical treatment of clinically typical visible or palpable actinic keratoses of the full face or balding scalp in immunocompetent adults.
Zyclara is supplied as a cream 3.75% designed for topical administration. Zyclara cream should be applied once daily before bedtime to the skin of the affected area (either the face or balding scalp) for two 2-week treatment cycles separated by a 2-week no-treatment period. The cream should be applied as a thin film to the entire treatment area and rubbed in until the cream is no longer visible. Up to 2 packets of Zyclara Cream may be applied to the treatment area at each application. It should be left on the skin for approximately 8 hours, after which time the cream should be removed by washing the area with mild soap and water.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Zyclara Cream was based on two double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled clinical studies. The studies enrolled 319 adults subjects with 5-20 typical visible or palpable AK lesions of the face or scalp. Zyclara Cream was applied to either the entire face (excluding ears) or balding scalp once daily for two 2-week treatment cycles separated by a 2-week no-treatment period. On a scheduled dosing day, up to two packets of the study cream were applied to the entire treatment area prior to normal sleeping hours and left on for approximately 8 hours. The subjects continued in the study for an 8- week follow-up period during which they returned for clinical observations and safety monitoring. Efficacy was assessed by AK lesion counts at the 8-week post-treatment visit. All AKs in the treatment area were counted, including baseline lesions as well as lesions which appeared during therapy. Complete clearance required absence of any lesions including those that appeared during therapy in the treatment area while partial clearance was defined as the percentage of subjects in whom the number of baseline AKs was reduced by 75% or more.

Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response.

Kidney Disease,Auryxia (Ferric citrate),"General Information
Auryxia (Ferric citrate) is an iron-based compound that has the capacity to bind to phosphate and form non-absorbable complexes. It lowers phosphate levels without raising calcium or aluminum levels.
Ferric citrate is specifically indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis.
Ferric citrate is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended starting dose is 2 tablets orally 3 times per day with meals. Serum phosphorus levels should be monitored and the dose of Ferric Citrate titrated in decrements or increments of 1 to 2 tablets per day as needed to maintain serum phosphorus at target levels, up to a maximum dose of 12 tablets daily. Dose can be titrated at 1-week or longer intervals.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ferric citrate was based on one 56-week, safety and efficacy trial, consisting of a 52-week active-controlled phase and a 4-week, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal period, and one 4-week open-label trial of different fixed doses of Ferric Citrate. Both trials excluded subjects who had an absolute requirement for aluminum containing drugs with meals.
Long-term, Randomized, Controlled, Safety and Efficacy Trial
After the 2-week washout period during which phosphate binders were held, patients with a mean serum phosphorus of 7.5 mg/dL during washout were randomized 2:1 to Ferric Citrate (N=292) or active control (calcium acetate and/or sevelamer carbonate; N=149). The majority of subjects were on hemodialysis. The starting dose of Ferric Citrate was 6 tablets/day, divided with meals. The starting dose of active control was the patientâ€™s dose prior to the washout period. The dose of phosphate binder was increased or decreased as needed to maintain serum phosphorus levels between 3.5 and 5.5 mg/dL, to a maximum of 12 tablets/day. Following completion of the 52-week active-controlled phase, Ferric Citrate-treated patients were eligible to enter a 4-week placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal phase, in which patients were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Ferric Citrate (N=96) or placebo (N=96). The study met the primary endpoint by demonstrating a highly statistically significant change in serum phosphorus versus placebo over the four-week Placebo Control Period. During the placebo-controlled period, the serum phosphorus concentration rose by 2.2 mg/dL in the placebo arm relative to the Ferric Citrate arm. Ferric citrate also demonstrated statistically significant increases in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT), and significant reductions in the use of IV iron and ESAs, versus an active control of sevelamer carbonate and/or calcium acetate over the 52-week Active Control Period of the study. In addition, mean hemoglobin levels were higher in subjects treated with Zerenex as compared to subjects treated with active control.
Fixed-Dose Trial
Following a 1- to 2-week washout from all phosphate-binding agents, 154 patients with hyperphosphatemia (mean serum phosphorus of 7.5 mg/dL) and CKD on dialysis were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1, 6, or 8 tablets/day of Ferric Citrate for 4 weeks. Ferric Citrate was administered with meals; subjects receiving 1 tablet/day were instructed to take it with their largest meal of the day, and subjects on 6 or 8 tablets/day took divided doses in any distribution with meals. Dose-dependent decreases in serum phosphorus were observed by Day 7 and remained relatively stable for the duration of treatment. The demonstrated reductions from baseline to Week 4 in mean serum phosphorus were significantly greater with 6 and 8 tablets/day than with 1 tablet/day (p<0.0001). Mean reduction in serum phosphorus at Week 4 was 0.1 mg/dL with 1 tablet/day, 1.9 mg/dL with 6 tablets/day, and 2.1 mg/dL with 8 tablets/day.

The recommended dosing is as follows: For patients weighing 50 kg (110 lb) or more: Give Injectafer in two doses separated by at least 7 days. Give each dose as 750 mg for a total cumulative dose not to exceed 1500 mg of iron per course. For patients weighing less than 50 kg (110 lb): Give Injectafer in two doses separated by at least 7 days. Give each dose as 15 mg/kg body weight for a total cumulative dose not to exceed 1500 mg of iron per course.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Injectafer for treatment of iron deficiency anemia was based on two clinical trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) in which Injectafer was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg body weight up to a maximum single dose of 750 mg of iron on two occasions separated by at least 7 days up to a maximum cumulative dose of 1500 mg of iron.
Trial One
This study enrolled 2,561 high risk patients with iron deficiency anemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD). It compared Injectafer to Venofer (iron sucrose injection. Data showed that two 750 mg doses of Injectafer raised hemoglobin more than five 200mg doses of Venofer, with a change in hemoglobin of 1.13 g/dL for Injectafer vs. 0.92 for Venofer. These increases were statistically significant (treatment difference = 0.2). Rates of the adjudicated composite safety endpoint comprised of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, hypertension and hypotension were statistically similar at 13.71% for Injectafer vs. 12.14% for Venofer. Rates of a composite of death, myocardial infarction and stroke were 1.88% for Injectafer vs. 2.72% for Venofer.
Trial Two
This trial enrolled approximately 1,000 subjects with iron deficiency anemia of various etiologies. The trial compared two 750 mg doses Injectafer to either oral or IV iron (standard of care therapy). Injectafer raised hemoglobin more than oral iron or IV standard of care therapy, with a mean change in hemoglobin of 1.57 g/dL vs. 0.80 g/dL when compared to oral iron and 2.90 g/dL vs. 2.16 g/dL when compared with IV standard of care therapy. These increases were statistically significant (p=0.001). Cardiovascular safety was evaluated based on an adjudicated composite safety endpoint comprised of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, hypertension and hypotension.

Kidney Disease,Jynarque (tolvaptan),"General Information
Jynarque (tolvaptan) is a selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist.
Jynarque is specifically indicated to slow kidney function decline in adults at risk of rapidly progressing autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
Jynarque is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is 60 mg orally per day as 45 mg taken on waking and 15 mg taken 8 hours later. Titrate to 60 mg plus 30 mg then to 90 mg plus 30 mg per day if tolerated with at least weekly intervals between titrations. Patients may down-titrate based on tolerability.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Jynarque was based on two pivotal trials, lasting one year and three years, respectively. In the one-year REPRISE study, the primary endpoint was the treatment difference in the change of eGFR from pretreatment baseline to post-treatment follow-up, annualized by dividing by each subjectâ€™s treatment duration. In the randomized period, the change of eGFR from pretreatment baseline to post-treatment follow-up was âˆ’2.3 mL/min/1.73 m2/year with tolvaptan as compared with âˆ’3.6 mL/min/1.73 m2/year with placebo, corresponding to a treatment effect of 1.3 mL/min/1.73 m2/year (p <0.0001). In the three-year TEMPO 3:4 study, tolvaptan reduced the rate of decline in eGFR by 1.0 mL /min /1.73m2 /year as compared to placebo in patients with earlier stages of ADPKD. In the extension trial, eGFR differences produced by the third year of the TEMPO 3:4 trial were maintained over the next 2 years of Jynarque treatment. The primary endpoint in TEMPO 3:4 study was the intergroup difference for rate of change of total kidney volume (TKV) normalized as a percentage. The trial met its pre-specified primary endpoint of 3-year change in TKV (p<0.0001).
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Jynarque may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Jynarque label comes with the following Black Box Warning:
Jynarque (tolvaptan) can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury. Acute liver failure requiring liver transplantation has been reported. Measure ALT, AST and bilirubin before initiating treatment, at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after initiation, then monthly for the ï¬�rst 18 months and every 3 months thereafter. Prompt action in response to laboratory abnormalities, signs, or symptoms indicative of hepatic injury can mitigate, but not eliminate, the risk of serious hepatotoxicity. Because of the risks of serious liver injury, Jynarque is available only through a restricted distribution program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).
","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Jynarque or autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, please visit https://www.jynarque.com/","Mechanism of Action
Jynarque (tolvaptan) is a selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist with an afï¬�nity for the V2-receptor that is 1.8 times that of native arginine vasopressin (AVP). Tolvaptan afï¬�nity for the V2-receptor is 29 times that for the V1a-receptor. Decreased binding of vasopressin to the V2-receptor in the kidney lowers adenylate cyclase activity resulting in a decrease in intracellular adenosine 3â€², 5â€²-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations. Decreased cAMP concentrations prevent aquaporin 2 containing vesicles from fusing with the plasma membrane, which in turn causes an increase in urine water excretion, an increase in free water clearance (aquaresis) and a decrease in urine osmolality.

Kidney Disease,Nulojix (belatacept),"General Information
Nulojix (belatacept) is a selective T-cell (lymphocyte) costimulation blocker, which supresses the immune system. Without immunosuppression, the body can reject a transplanted organ because the immune system recognizes the new organ as foreign.
Nolojix is specifically indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients receiving a kidney transplant. It is approved for use in combination with basiliximab induction, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids.
Nolojix is supplied as a powder for reconstitution into a solution for intravenous infusion. The total infusion dose of Nulojix should be based on the actual body weight of at the time of transplantation, and should not be modified during the course of treatment unless there is a change in body weight of greater than 10%. The recommended dose is as follows:
Dosing for Initial Phase
Day 1 (day of transplantation, prior to implantation) and Day 5 (approximately 96 hours after Day 1 dose): 10 mg per kg
End of Week 2 and Week 4 after transplantation: 10 mg per kg
End of Week 8 and Week 12 after transplantation: 10 mg per kg
Dosing for Maintenance Phase
End of Week 16 after transplantation and every 4 weeks (plus or minus 3 days) thereafter: 5 mg per kg
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Nulojix was based on two open-label, randomized, multicenter, active-controlled trials (Study 1 and Study 2). These trials evaluated two dose regimens of Nulojix, the recommended dosage regimen and a regimen with higher cumulative doses and more frequent dosing than the recommended dosage regimen, compared to a cyclosporine control regimen. The Nulojix recommended regimen consisted of a 10 mg per kg dose administered on Day 1 (the day of transplantation, prior to implantation), Day 5 (approximately 96 hours after the Day 1 dose), end of Weeks 2 and 4; then every four weeks through Week 12 after transplantation. Starting at Week 16 after transplantation, Nulojix was administered at the maintenance dose of 5 mg per kg every four weeks (plus or minus 3 days). Nulojix was administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. Efficacy data are from the Nulojix recommended regimen.
Study 1: Recipients of Living Donor and Standard Criteria Deceased Donor Kidneys
A total of 666 subjects were enrolled. Discontinuation from treatment at the end of three years occurred in 25% of subjects receiving Nulojox recommended regimen and 34% receiving the cyclosporine regimen. Efficacy was based on biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR), graft loss, death, or lost to follow-up. By three years, recurrent BPAR occurred with similar frequency across treatment groups.
Study 2: Recipients of Extended Criteria Donor Kidneys
A total of 543 subjects were enrolled. At the end of three years, 35% of subjects receiving the Nulojix recommended regimen and 44% of subjects receiving the cyclosporine regimen had discontinued from treatment. By three years, recurrent BPAR occurred with similar frequency across treatment groups.

Parsabiv (etelcalcetide) is a calcium-sensing receptor agonist.
Parsabiv is specifically indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adult patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis.
Parsabiv is supplied as an injection for intravenous administration. Prior to Parsabiv administration, dose increase, or re-initiation, ensure corrected serum calcium is at or above the lower limit of normal. The recommended starting dose of Parsabiv is 5 mg administered by intravenous (IV) bolus injection three times per week at the end of hemodialysis treatment. The maintenance dose of Parsabiv is individualized and determined by titration based on parathyroid hormone (PTH) and corrected serum calcium response. The maintenance dose is the dose that maintains PTH levels within the recommended target range and corrected serum calcium within the normal range. The lowest maintenance dose of Parsabiv is 2.5 mg three times per week, and the highest maintenance dose of Parsabiv is 15 mg three times per week.
Administer Parsabiv only at the end of hemodialysis treatment. If a regularly scheduled hemodialysis treatment is missed, do not administer any missed doses. Resume Parsabiv at the end of the next hemodialysis treatment at the prescribed dose. If doses of Parsabiv are missed for more than 2 weeks, re-initiate Parsabiv at the recommended starting dose of 5 mg (or 2.5 mg if that was the patientâ€™s last dose).
Please see drug label for specific monitoring and dose requirement instructions.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Parsabiv was based on two 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. An aggregate of 1,023 patients with moderate-to-severe secondary HPT (PTH greater than 400 pg/mL) on hemodialysis were randomized to receive intravenous Parsabiv or placebo three times a week, at the end of their dialysis sessions in addition to standard of care that could include vitamin D and/or phosphate binders. The primary endpoint of both studies was the proportion of patients achieving greater than 30 percent reduction from baseline in PTH during the Efficacy Assessment Phase (EAP), defined as weeks 20 through 27. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with PTH less than or equal to 300 pg/mL during the EAP; and percent reductions in PTH, albumin-adjusted calcium (cCa), phosphate (P) and cCa x P during the EAP. The two studies showed that significantly more Parsabiv than placebo patients, respectively, achieved:
A greater than 30 percent reduction from baseline in PTH during the EAP: 77% versus 11% in Study 1, and 79% versus 11% in Study 2
PTH levels of 300 pg/mL or less during the EAP: 52% versus 6% in Study 1, and 56% versus 5% in Study 2

Kidney Disease,Procysbi (cysteamine bitartrate),"General Information
Procysbi (cysteamine bitartrate) ) delayed-release capsules is a cystine depleting agent which lowers the cystine content of cells in patients with nephropathic cystinosis, an inherited defect of lysosomal transport.
Procysbi is specifically indicated for the management of nephropathic cystinosis in adults and children ages 6 years and older.
Procysbi is supplied as a delayed-release capsule and can be administered either orally or via a feeding tube. It should be taken at least 2 hours after and at least 30 min before eating. Starting Dose: Procysbi therapy should be initiated promptly once the diagnosis is confirmed. Cysteamine-naÃ¯ve patients should be started on 1/6 to 1/4 of the maintenance dose of Procysbi. The dose should be raised gradually over 4 to 6 weeks to help reduce the risk of side-effects. WBC cystine level and/or cysteamine concentration measurements, taken Â½ hour after dose administration, are recommended for new patients after the maintenance dose is achieved. Maintenance Dose: The recommended maintenance dose is 1.3 gram/m2/day, in two divided doses given every 12 hours. The dose can be increased up to 1.95 grams/m2/day if the white blood cell cystine level remains higher than the target WBC cystine level and/or the target cysteamine concentration has not been achieved.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Procysbi was based on the following trials. Trial 1 (RP103-01) was a single center, single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, 2-period, immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate vs. Pocysbi pilot study in 9 (8 pediatric and 1 adult) patients with nephropathic cystinosis ages 6 years to 24 years. The trial reported highly variable inter-patient bioavailability with both immediate-release cysteamine and Procysbi. The trial suggested that, when WBC cystine trough levels are used as a measurement of cellular cystine depletion, delayed-release cysteamine (Procysbi) administered every 12 hours (Q12H) is as effective as immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate administered every 6 hours (Q6H).
Trials 2, 5 and 6 (RP103-02, RP103-05, and RP103-06 respectively) were PK studies conducted in healthy volunteers. Trial 3 (RP103-03), the pivotal trial for Procysbi, was a phase III multicenter (US and EU) randomized, crossover, immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate vs. Procysbi trial in 43 (40 pediatric and 3 adult) patients with nephropathic cystinosis. Patient age ranged from 6 to 26 years. Prior to randomization, patients were to be on a stable dose of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate administered Q6H. Procysbi dose adjustments of up to ~100% of the total daily dose of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate were allowed by trial criteria. The average total daily dose of Procysbi for patients completing the clinical trial was ~91 % of the average total daily dose of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate for patients at trial entry. Trial 3 demonstrated that at steady-state Procysbi (cysteamine bitartrate) delayed-release capsules administered Q12H was non-inferior to immediate release cysteamine bitartrate administered Q6H with respect to the depletion of WBC cystine levels. Forty out of forty-one patients completing Trial 3 are continuing treatment with Procysbi in an ongoing, open-label extension trial, i.e. Trial 4 (RP103Â­ 04), for total treatment duration of 24 months. Twenty additional patients (14 pediatric patients, ages 1 to 6 years, and 6 (4 adult and 2 pediatric) renal transplant patients) have also been enrolled in Trial 4. An interim analysis was performed after all enrolled patients from Trial 3 had been treated with Pocysbi for at least 12 months (n=33) and up to 19 months (n=3). The analysis indicated that patients switched from immediate-release cysteamine to a treatment regimen of Procysbi maintained a WBC level < 1 nmol/Â½ cystine/mg protein for up to 19 months at a total daily dose equal to their total daily dose of immediate release cysteamine at entry in Trial 3. During extended treatment there has been on average no worsening of the kidney function, as expressed by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

Rayaldee is specifically indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease and serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL.
Rayaldee is supplied as an extended release capsule for oral administration. The initial recommended dose of Rayaldee is 30 mcg administered orally once daily at bedtime. Serum calcium should be below 9.8 mg/dL before initiating treatment. Monitor serum calcium, phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) 3 months after starting therapy or changing dose. Increase the dose to 60 mcg once daily after 3 months if intact PTH is above the treatment goal. Ensure serum calcium is below 9.8 mg/dL, phosphorus is below 5.5 mg/dL and 25-hydroxyvitamin D is below 100 ng/mL before increasing the dose. Suspend dosing if intact PTH is persistently abnormally low, serum calcium is consistently above the normal range or serum 25Â­ hydroxyvitamin D is consistently above 100 ng/mL
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Rayaldee was based on two identical multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease and serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 10 and 30 ng/mL. Subjects were stratified by chronic kidney disease stage and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive Rayaldee or a matching placebo at bedtime over 26 weeks. The dose of Rayaldee was 30 mcg once daily for the first 12 weeks and either 30 or 60 mcg once daily for the last 14 weeks. The dose was increased to 60 mcg at the start of week 13 if the plasma intact PTH level was greater than 70 pg/mL, the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was less than 65 ng/mL and the serum calcium level was less than 9.8 mg/dL. A total of 213 subjects were randomized in one trial and 216 subjects were randomized in the second trial. The primary analysis compared the proportion of individuals who experienced an at least 30% reduction in plasma intact PTH from baseline to end of trial (average of weeks 20, 22, 24 and 26). A larger proportion of patients randomized to Rayaldee experienced an at least 30% reduction in plasma intact PTH from baseline compared to placebo in both trials [33% versus 8% in the first trial (P<0.001) and 34% versus 7% in the second trial (P<0.001)]. Serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels increased to at least 30 ng/mL in 80% and 83% of subjects treated with RAYALDEE vs. 3% and 7% of subjects treated with placebo (P<0.001) in the two studies, respectively. Average steadystate 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were 50 and 56 ng/mL for subjects receiving 30 mcg daily, and 69 and 67 ng/mL for subjects receiving 60 mcg daily, in the first and second studies, respectively.

Kidney Disease,Renagel (sevelamer hydrochloride),"General Information
Renagel is a polymeric amine that binds phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and prevents phosphate from being absorbed.
Renagel is specifically indicated for the control of serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis.
Renagel is supplied as 400 mg and 800 mg tablets designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is as follows:
Patients Not Taking a Phosphate Binder
Renagel 800 to 1600 mg, which can be administered as one or two 800 mg tablets or two to four 400 mg tablets, with meals based on serum phosphorus level:
Serum Phosphorus >5.5 and <7.5 mg/dL: Renagel 800 mg: 1 tablet three times daily with meals; Renagel 400 mg: 2 tablets three times daily with meals
Serum Phosphorus â‰¥ 7.5 and <9.0 mg/dL: Renagel 800 mg: 2 tablets three times daily with meals; Renagel 400 mg: 3 tablets three times daily with meals
Serum Phosphorus â‰¥9.0 mg/dL: Renagel 800 mg: 2 tablets three times daily with meals; Renagel 400 mg: 4 tablets three times daily with meals
Patients Switching From Calcium Acetate
Calcium Acetate 667 mg (Tablets per meal)
1 tablet: Renagel 800 mg: 1 tablet/meal; Renagel 400 mg: 2 tablets/meal
2 tablets: Renagel 800 mg: 2 tablets/meal; Renagel 400 mg: 3 tablets/meal
3 tablets Renagel 800 mg: 3 tablets/meal; Renagel 400 mg: 5 tablets/meal.
Dose Titration for All Patients Taking Renagel Dosage should be adjusted based on the serum phosphorus concentration with a goal of lowering serum phosphorus to 5.5 mg/dL or less.
Serum Phosphorus >5.5 mg/dL: increase 1 tablet per meal at 2 week intervals
Serum Phosphorus 3.5 - 5.5 mg/dL: maintain current dose
Serum Phosphorus < 3.5 mg/dL: decrease 1 tablet per meal
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Renagel was based on six clinical trials: one double-blind placebo controlled 2-week study; two open-label uncontrolled 8-week studies and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks. Three of the active-controlled studies are described:
Active-Control, Crossover Study in Hemodialysis Patients
This trial enrolled 84 subjects on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 6.0 mg/dL). Following a two-week phosphate binder washout period, subjects were randomized to receive Renagel and active control for eight weeks each. Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period. Subjects started on treatment three times per day with meals. Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of Renagel could be titrated up 1 capsule or tablet per meal (3 per day) to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active control could also be altered to attain phosphate control. Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL.
Active-Control, Parallel Study in Hemodialysis Patients
This trial enrolled 200 CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL). Following a two-week phosphate binder washout period, subjects were randomized to receive Renagel 800 mg tablets or an active control. The two treatments produced similar decreases in serum phosphorus. At week 52, using last- observation-carried-forward, Renagel and control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus.
Active-Control, Parallel Study in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients
This trial enrolled 143 subjects on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dL). Following a two-week phosphate binder washout period, subjects were randomized to receive Renagel or active control open label for 12 weeks. Average daily Renagel dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g). There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p < 0.001) for Renagel (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active control.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Renagel may include, but are not limited to, the following:

Renagel (sevelamer hydrochloride) is a non-absorbed binding crosslinked polymer. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the dietary tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer hydrochloride lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum.

Kidney Disease,Renvela (sevelamer carbonate),"General Information
Renvela contains sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate binding crosslinked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the dietary tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum.
Renvela is specifically indicated for the control of serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis.
Renvela is supplied as a tablet designed for oral administration. The recommended initial dose is as follows:
Patients Not Taking a Phosphate Binde:
Serum phosphorus >5.5 and <7.5 mg/dL: Renvela 800 mg 1 tablet three times daily with meals.
Serum phosphorus â‰¥7.5 and <9.0 mg/dL: Renvela 800 mg 2 tablets three times daily with meals.
Serum phosphorus â‰¥9.0 mg/dL Renvela 800 mg 2 tablets three times daily with meals.
Patients Switching from Sevelamer Hydrochloride
Sevelamer carbonate should be prescribed on a gram per gram basis. Further titration to the desired phosphate levels may be necessary. The highest daily dose of sevelamer carbonate studied was 14 grams in CKD patients on dialysis.
Patients Switching From Calcium Acetate
The dose schedule of Renvela should match the dose schedule of the current calcium acetate dose. I.e. if current calcium acetate dose is 1 tablet per meal, the Renvela dose should be 1 tablet per meal.
Dose Titration for All Patients Taking Renvela
The dose should be increased or decreased by one tablet per meal at two week intervals, as necessary, with the goal of controlling serum phosphorus within the target range of 3.5 mg/dL to 5.5 mg/dL.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Renvela was based on a double-blind, active controlled, cross-over study in 79 hemodialysis patients with two 8- week treatment periods. Stage 5 CKD patients on hemodialysis were entered into a five-week sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period and received, in random order, sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablets and sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablets for eight weeks each, with no intervening washout. Study dose during the cross-over period was determined based on the sevelamer hydrochloride dose during the run-in period on a gram per gram basis. The phosphate levels at the end of each of the two cross-over periods were similar. Average actual daily dose was 6 g/day for both treatments.

Kidney Disease,Ultomiris (ravulizumab-cwvz),"General Information
Ultomiris (ravulizumab-cwvz) is a humanized monoclonal antibody.
Ultomiris is specifically indicated for the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) for adult and pediatric (one month of age and older) patients.
Ultomiris is supplied as an injection for intravenous infusion. The recommended dosing regimen in adult and pediatric patients one month of age and older with aHUS weighing 5 kg or greater, consists of a loading dose followed by maintenance dosing, administered by intravenous infusion. Administer the doses based on the patientâ€™s body weight, as shown in the table in the drug's prescription label. Starting 2 weeks after the loading dose administration, begin maintenance doses once every 8 weeks or every 4 weeks (depending on body weight). The dosing schedule is allowed to occasionally vary within 7 days of the scheduled infusion day (except for the first maintenance dose of ULTOMIRIS); but the subsequent doses should be administered according to the original schedule.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Ultomiris for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) was based on data from two global, single-arm open-label studies â€“ one in adults and one in children, referred to as pediatrics in the study â€“ with aHUS. The pediatric study is ongoing and a total of 14 out of 16 children were enrolled and included in the interim analysis. Efficacy evaluation of Complete TMA Response was defined by hematologic normalization parameters (platelet count and LDH) and improved kidney function (as measured by â‰¥ 25 percent improvement in serum creatinine from baseline). In the initial 26-week treatment periods, 54 percent of adults and 71 percent (interim data) of children demonstrated Complete TMA Response. Treatment with Ultomiris resulted in reduced thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count) in 84 percent of adults and 93 percent of children, reduced hemolysis (the destruction of red blood cells) in 77 percent of adults and 86 percent of children, and improved kidney function in 59 percent of adults and 79 percent (interim data) of children (for patients on dialysis at enrollment, baseline was established after they had come off dialysis).
","Side Effects

Kidney Disease,Voraxaze (glucarpidase),"General Information
Voraxaze (glucarpidase) contains a recombinant enzyme which rapidly lowers blood levels of methotrexate, reducing its concentration to below the threshold for serious toxicity. Voraxaze converts methotrexate to its inactive metabolites DAMPA and glutamate. DAMPA and glutamate are metabolized by the liver, providing an alternative route of methotrexate elimination to renal clearance during high-dose methotrexate treatment.
Voraxaze is specifically indicated for the treatment of toxic plasma methotrexate concentrations (>1 micromole per liter) in patients with delayed methotrexate clearance due to impaired renal function.
Voraxaze is supplied as a solution for intravenous administration. The recommended dose is a single intravenous injection of 50 Units per kg. as a bolus injection over 5 minutes.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Voraxaze was based on an efficacy and safety study.
Efficacy Study
A single clinical study enrolled 22 subjects. All subjects received Voraxaze treatment. The treatment was considered effective if the methotrexate level fell below a critical level within 15 minutes and stayed below the critical level for eight days. Ten of the 22 subjects achieved this standard. Voraxaze eliminated 95% of the methotrexate in all subjects, regardless of whether they reached the efficacy endpoint.
Safety Study
A separate clinical study evaluated the safety of Voraxaze in 290 subjects experiencing problems clearing methotrexate from their blood. The most common side effects observed in greater than one percent of subjects in the clinical study were low blood pressure (hypotension), headache, nausea, vomiting, flushing, and abnormal sensation (paraesthesia).

The recommended dose of Soliris for pediatrics under the age of 18 years is based on body weight.
The recommended dose of Soliris for gMG and NMSOD consists of: â€¢ 900 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by â€¢ 1200 mg for the fifth dose 1 week later, then â€¢ 1200 mg every 2 weeks thereafter. Administer Soliris at the recommended dosage regimen time points, or within two days of these time points. is 900 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1200 mg for the fifth dose 1 week later, then 1200 mg every 2 weeks thereafter.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Soliris for PNH was based on the results of three clinical trials.
Study 1
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 87 subjects who had received at least four transfusions in the prior 12 months, had a flow cytometric confirmation of at least 10% PNH cells and platelet counts of at least 100,000/microliter. All subjects received meningococcal vaccination prior to treatment. They were subsequently observed to determine the hemoglobin concentration ""set-point"" in order to define each patientâ€™s hemoglobin stabilization and transfusion outcomes. The subjects were then randomized to receive placebo or Soliris, via intravenous infusion over 25 - 45 minutes, at 600 mg every 7 Â± 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 Â± 2 days later, then 900 mg every 14 Â± 2 days for 26 weeks. Primary endpoints included hemoglobin stabilization, the number of RBC units transfused, fatigue, and health-related quality of life. Results revealed that the subjects treated with Soliris had significantly reduced hemolysis compared to placebo (p< 0.001), resulting in improvements in anemia as indicated by increased hemoglobin stabilization and reduced need for RBC transfusions. After 3 weeks of Soliris treatment, patients reported less fatigue and improved health-related quality of life.
Study 2 and extension study
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 97 subjects, 96 of whom completed treatment, who had received at least one transfusion in the prior 24 months and with at least 30,000 platelets/microliter. All subjects received meningococcal vaccination prior to treatment followed by Soliris, via intravenous infusion over 25 - 45 minutes, at 600 mg every 7 Â± 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg 7 Â± 2 days later, then 900 mg every 14 Â± 2 days for 52 weeks. Concomitant medications included anti-thrombotic agents and systemic corticosteroids. The primary endpoints were the same as in study 1. A reduction in intravascular hemolysis, measured by serum LDH levels, was sustained for the treatment period and resulted in a reduced need for RBC transfusion and less fatigue. The long term study enrolled 187 Soliris treated subjects. A reduction in intravascular hemolysis over a total Soliris exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 months was sustained by all the subjects. In addition, there were fewer thrombotic events with Soliris treatment than during the same period of time prior to treatment. The effects of concomitant anticoagulant therapy withdrawal during Soliris therapy was not studied.
The FDA approval of Soliris for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was based on three single-arm studies: two prospective (aHUS Studies 1 and 2) and one retrospective study (aHUS Study 3). In all studies, the dose of Soliris in adult and adolescent patients was 900 mg every 7 days for four weeks, followed by 1200 mg 7 days later, then 1200 mg every 14 days thereafter. The dosage regimen for pediatrics weighing less than 40 kg enrolled in aHUS Study 3 was based on body weight. Efficacy evaluations were based on thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) endpoints. These endpoints included platelet count change from baseline, hematologic normalization, complete TMA response, TMA-event free status and daily TMA intervention rate.
aHUS Resistant to PE/PI (aHUS Study 1)
This trial enrolled 17 subjects who displayed signs of TMA despite receiving at least four PE/PI treatments the week prior to screening. The subjects received Soliris for a minimum of 26 weeks. Soliris reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. The mean platelet count increased from 109 x10(9)/L at baseline to 169 x10(9)/L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count at week 26: 210 x10(9)/L). Renal function, as measured by median eGFR, was improved during Soliris therapy. Four of the five subjects who required dialysis at study entry were able to discontinue dialysis for the duration of Soliris treatment.
aHUS Sensitive to PE/PI (aHUS Study 2)
This trial enrolled 20 subjects undergoing chronic PE/PI who generally did not display hematologic signs of ongoing thrombotic microangiopathy. The subjects received Soliris for a minimum of 26 weeks. Soliris reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. Platelet counts were maintained at normal levels despite the elimination of PE/PI. The mean platelet count was 229 x 10(9)/L at baseline, and 233 x10(9)/L at week 26. Renal function, as measured by median eGFR, was maintained during Soliris therapy.
Retrospective Study in Patients with aHUS (aHUS Study 3)
This trial enrolled 19 pediatrics (ages 2 months to 17 years) who received Soliris for a median duration of 16 weeks. Soliris reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline. Mean platelet count increased from 171 x10(9)/L at baseline to 233 x10(9)/L after one week of therapy; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count at week 26: 254 x10(9)/L). Nine subjects experienced an eGFR improvement of at least 15 mL/min/1.73 m2.
The FDA approval of Soliris for gMG was based on a 26-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. A total of 62 patients were randomized to receive Soliris treatment and 63 were randomized to receive placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was a comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the Myasthenia Gravis-Specific Activities of Daily Living scale (MG-ADL) total score at Week 26. A statistically significant difference favoring Soliris was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in MG-ADL total scores [-4.2 points in the Soliris treated group compared with -2.3 points in the placebo-treated group (p=0.006)].
The FDA approval of Soliris for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive was based on a study of 143 patients who were randomized to receive either Soliris treatment or placebo. Compared to treatment with placebo, the study showed that treatment with Soliris reduced the number of NMOSD relapses by 94 percent over the 48-week course of the trial. Soliris also reduced the need for hospitalizations and the need for treatment of acute attacks with corticosteroids and plasma exchange.

","Additional Information
For additional information regarding Soliris or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and generalized Myasthenia Gravis, please visit the Soliris web page.","Mechanism of Action
Soliris is a is a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG2/4 antibody produced by murine myeloma cell culture. A genetic mutation in PNH leads to the generation of abnormal red blood cells (RBCs) that are deficient in terminal complement inhibitors, rendering them sensitive to persistent terminal complement-mediated destruction. The destruction and loss of these RBCs leads to the symptoms associated with PNH. The active ingredient in Soliris, eculizumab, specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. Soliris inhibits terminal complement mediated intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients.

Acute kidney failure,Voraxaze (glucarpidase),,,,
Kidney Failure (Pediatric),Soliris (eculizumab),,,,
Kidney Transplantation,Envarsus XR (tacrolimus extended-release),"General Information
Envarsus XR is an extended release formulation of tacrolimus, a calcineurin-inhibitor immunosuppressant.
Envarsus XR is specifically indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients converted from tacrolimus immediate-release formulations, in combination with other immunosuppressants.
Envarsus XR is supplied as a tablet for oral administration. It should be taken on an empty stomach at the same time of the day, preferably in the morning (to ensure consistent and maximum possible drug exposure). The Envarsus XR tablets should be swallowed whole with fluid (preferably water). Do not chew, divide, or crush the tablets. If a dose is missed, take it as soon as possible within 15 hours after missing the dose; beyond the 15-hour time frame, wait until the usual scheduled time to take the next regular daily dose. Do not double the next dose. Avoid eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice or alcoholic beverage while taking Envarsus XR. African-American patients, compared to Caucasian patients, may need to be titrated to higher Envarsus XR dosages to attain comparable trough concentrations.
To convert from a tacrolimus immediate-release product to Envarsus XR, administer an Envarsus XR once daily dose that is 80% of the total daily dose of the tacrolimus immediate-release product. Monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations and titrate Envarsus XR dosage to achieve target whole blood trough concentration ranges of 4 to 11 ng/mL.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Envarsus XR was based on a conversion study. The conversion study was a randomized, open-label, multinational study evaluating once daily Envarsus XR when used to replace tacrolimus immediate-release administered twice daily for maintenance immunosuppression to prevent acute allograft rejection in stable adult kidney transplant patients. Patients who received a kidney transplant 3 months to 5 years before study entry and on a stable dose of tacrolimus immediate-release of at least 2 mg per day and tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations between 4 and 15 ng/mL were randomized to 1) switch from twice daily tacrolimus immediate-release to once daily Envarsus XR (N=163) or 2) continue tacrolimus immediate-release twice daily (N=163). MMF or mycophenolate sodium (MPS), or azathioprine (AZA) and/or corticosteroids were allowed as concomitant immunosuppressants during the study period according to the standard of care at the participating site. In the conversion study, stable kidney transplant patients converted to Envarsus XR at an average daily dose that was 80% of their tacrolimus immediate-release daily dose prior to conversion. Mean tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations were maintained within a relatively narrow range throughout the duration of the study for both the Envarsus XR conversion group and the tacrolimus immediate-release continuation group. At Week 1 (after 7 days of stable dosing), the mean Â± SD tacrolimus trough concentrations were 7.2 Â± 3.1 ng/mL for the Envarsus XR conversion group and 7.7 Â± 2.5 for the tacrolimus immediate-release continuation group; the baseline values were 7.8 Â± 2.3, and 8.0 Â± 2.3, respectively. Study Drug: MMF In the conversion study, the average daily mycophenolate equivalent doses were comparable between the Envarsus XR and tacrolimus immediate-release treatment groups. The efficacy failure rates including patients who developed BPAR, graft failure, death, and/or lost to follow-up at 12 months, as well as the rates of the individual events were essentially the same between the tacrolimus immediate-release and tacrolimus extended-release groups.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with the use of Envarsus XR may include, but are not limited to, the following:
diarrhea
blood creatinine increased
Envarsus XR comes with a black box warning of the potential risk of developing serious infections and malignancies.

Envarsus XR is an extended release formulation of tacrolimus, a calcineurin-inhibitor immunosuppressant. Tacrolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12. A complex of tacrolimus-FKBP-12, calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin (an ubiquitous mammalian intracellular enzyme) is then formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin inhibited. Such inhibition prevents the dephosphorylation and translocation of various factors such as the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-ÎºB). Tacrolimus inhibits the expression and/or production of several cytokines that include interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor. Tacrolimus also inhibits IL-2 receptor expression and nitric oxide release, induces apoptosis and production of transforming growth factor-beta that can lead to immunosuppressive activity. The net result is the inhibition of T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation as well as T-helper-cell-dependent B-cell response (i.e., immunosuppression).

Kidney Transplantation,Prograf,"General Information
Prograf has been approved for use as an immunosuppressive for the prevention of organ rejection in kidney transplant recipients. It is manufactured in capsule and injection form. Previously, Prograf has been used since 1994 for the prophylaxis of rejection in liver transplants.
","Side Effects
Adverse effects associated with Prograf include tremor, hypertension, hypophosphatemia, infection, creatinine increase, headache, and diarrhea. New onset post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) was seen in 20% of Prograf-treated kidney transplant patients. The percentage of PTDM patients that remained insulin dependent at the two year post-transplant mark declined to 11%.",,
Kidney Transplantation,Rapamune (sirolimus) Tablets,"General Information
Rapamune (sirolimus) is an immunosuppressant agent developed to reduce organ rejection in patients receiving kidney transplants. It is to be used in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids, and has been shown to significantly reduce rejection rates when compared to control regimens.
Kidney transplantation is one of the most common transplant procedures performed in the United States. Patients receive immunosuppressant agents in order to lower the body's normal immune response, which in turn decreases the risk of organ rejection by the immune system.
Clinical Results
Previous trials for the oral solution of Rapamune indicated that sirolimus is more effective than placebo treatment in reducing the rate of transplant rejection. Two randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled trials were conducted to investigate the possible benefits of Rapamune. The studies compared two dose levels of Rapamune oral solution to placebo and azathioprine treatment, all of which were administered in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids.
The two phase III trials evaluating the efficacy of sirolimus have indicated that sirolimus is safe and effective. The Rapamune U.S. Multicenter Study included 719 renal transplant recipients who received either sirolimus or azathioprine treatments. Both sirolimus doses were found to be significantly more effective than azathioprine in reducing rejection. In the Rapamune Global Study, conducted in Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States, 576 renal transplant recipients received either sirolimus or placebo treatment. Both studies demonstrated that sirolimus was more effective in reducing organ rejection within the first 6 months following a transplant. (from the Drug Monitor)
","Side Effects
The following side effects have been associated with the oral solution of Rapamune:
High cholesterol
High blood pressure
Acne
Anemia
Fever
Diarrhea
Rash
Additionally, there is an increased risk of infection and malignancies, which is common with immunosuppression treatment.

Sirolimus inhibits T lymphocyte activation and proliferation, which occurs in response to antigenic and cytokine stimulation; however, its mechanism is distinct from that of other immunosuppressants. Sirolimus also inhibits antibody production. In cells, sirolimus binds to the immunophilin, FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to generate an immunosuppressive complex. The sirolimus: FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. This complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. This inhibition suppresses cytokine-driven T-cell proliferation, inhibiting the phase progression of the cell cycle. (from FDA label)

Kidney Transplantation,Zenapax,"General Information
Hoffman-La Roche's new monoclonal antibody drug, Zenapax (daclizumab), has been approved to prevent rejection of kidney transplants. The drug uses the body's own immune system to prevent the acute rejection that can make kidney transplants fail.
Clinical Results
The FDA said its approval was based on two clinical trials that showed Zenapax significantly reduced acute rejections in patients who got the drug along with the standard three-drug cocktail of immunosuppressant drugs. Patients on Zenapax had 37 to 40% fewer rejections episodes than those given an inert placebo.",,,
Kidney Transplantation,Zortress (everolimus),"General Information
Zortress (everolimus) is a macrolide immunosuppressant. It inhibits the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase, as well as antigenic and interleukin (IL-2 and IL-15) stimulated activation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes.
Zortress is specifically indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients at low-moderate immunologic risk receiving a kidney transplant.
Zortress is supplied as tablet for oral administration. The recommended initial dose of the drug is 0.75 mg orally twice daily (1.5 mg/day) for adult kidney transplant patients in combination with reduced dose cyclosporine, administered as soon as possible after transplantation.
Clinical Results
FDA Approval
The FDA approval of Zortress for kidney transplant rejection was based on the following studies:
Study One
This 24-month, multi-national, open-label, randomized study enrolled 833 low to moderate risk renal transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant. The subjects received everolimus regimens of 1.5 mg per day starting dose (targeting 3 to 8 ng/mL) and 3.0 mg per day starting dose (targeting 6 to 12 ng/mL) with reduced doses of cyclosporine and corticosteroids OR 1.44 gm per day of mycophenolic acid with standard doses of cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The mean cyclosporine starting dose was 5.2, 5.0 and 5.7 mg/kg body weight/day in the everolimus 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg and in mycophenolic acid groups, respectively. Results at 12 months indicated that everolimus 1.5 mg per day is comparable to Myfortic with respect to efficacy failure, defined as treated biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, death or loss to follow-up. The incidence of efficacy failure was 25% and 24% in the everolimus and Myfortic groups, respectively. The calculated mean glomerular filtration rate (using the MDRD equation) for everolimus 1.5 mg (target trough concentrations 3 to 8 ng/mL) and mycophenolic acid were comparable at Month 12.
Studies Two and Three
Two multicenter, double-blind (for first 12 months), randomized trials compared fixed doses of everolimus 1.5 mg per day and 3 mg per day, without therapeutic drug monitoring, combined with standard doses of cyclosporine and corticosteroids to mycophenolate mofetil 2.0 gm per day and corticosteroids. A total of 588 and 583 de novo renal transplant patients were enrolled. The 12 month analysis of GFR showed increased rates of renal impairment in both the everolimus groups compared to the mycophenolate mofetil group in both studies. Therefore, reduced doses of cyclosporine should be used in combination with everolimus in order to avoid renal dysfunction.
","Side Effects
Adverse events associated with the use of Zortress may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Peripheral edema
Constipation
Hypertension
Nausea
Anemia
Urinary tract infection
Hyperlipidemia
","Additional Information

Everolimus binds to the immunophilin FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12) to generate an immunosuppressive complex that binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. Inhibition of mTOR activation results in the inhibition of T lymphocyte activation and proliferation associated with antigen and cytokine (IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15) stimulation and the inhibition of antibody production.
